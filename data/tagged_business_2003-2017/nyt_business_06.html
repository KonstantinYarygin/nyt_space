<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If reality television could be considered an economic indicator, then perhaps the recovery is finally under way. Slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two networks are betting on shows based on entrepreneurs competing for seed money for their business ideas. NBC's ''America's Next Great Restaurant'' features aspiring restaurateurs trying to impress a panel of judges to win financing for a new chain. And ABC has reintroduced ''Shark Tank,'' in which entrepreneurs try to get backing from a panel of venture capitalists who bet with their own money -- in exchange for a piece of the action.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think this area is a gold mine -- where business hits reality television,'' said Paul Telegdy, the executive in charge of reality programming for NBC. ''Wealth creation and the concept of capitalism are things that are inherently top-of-mind in America.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, as the economy crashed, reality television producers rushed out shows about pawnshops and scavenging like A&amp;E's ''Pawn Stars'' and ''Storage Wars'' -- a reflection of the desperate mood across the country. Are viewers now ready for a more optimistic view?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far the results are not worthy of a buy order. ''Shark Tank'' showed improvement over its first year's ratings in its return last week, but still attracted less than a hit-level audience at 6.1 million viewers. NBC's restaurant show, which has averaged only about 4.3 million viewers, is being buffeted by other reality competition on Sunday (especially ''The Amazing Race'' on CBS and another, more heart-tugging money-oriented show on ABC, ''Secret Millionaire''), but it showed an unexpected sign of life when NBC ran a repeat on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Burnett, the most successful reality producer in television, with ''Survivor'' and another business show, ''The Apprentice,'' on his resume, jumped at the chance to produce ''Shark Tank'' both because he was familiar with the show from British television (where it was called ''Dragon's Den'') and because of his personal entrepreneurial experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I emigrated here from England and started out selling T-shirts on the beach,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''I can really identify with these entrepreneurs.'' He said he had also produced a pilot for VH1 about ''business turnarounds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, ''Shark Tank'' was a marginal success on Sunday night. This year, it is playing regularly on Friday nights and has added some celebrity juice to its panel of venture capitalists, in the form of the comedian Jeff Foxworthy and the prominent businessman -- and sports franchise owner -- Mark Cuban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuban certainly believes in the concept of putting up his own money for entrepreneurial ideas. He said in a telephone interview, ''I get amped up about a lot of things, as people know, but this was exciting.'' One of the aspiring entrepreneurs managed to get the bidding up to $4 million, a sum that Mr. Burnett said was probably ''the biggest amount ever available in a nonfiction TV show.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dragon's Den'' began in Japan, and the format is owned by <span class="companylink">Sony</span>. Steve Mosko, the president of <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Pictures Television, said the format for ''Dragon's Den'' had been sold in 38 countries, and had become a hit in many. (The most recent editions are in Poland and Saudi Arabia.) Mr. Burnett changed the title thinking that, in the United States, dragons would not conjure the image of tough venture capitalists as well as sharks would. ''Blood in the water and all that,'' Mr. Burnett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mosko said it should be ''the perfect format'' for American audiences, given the whole ''American dream thing.'' From a business point of view it has another advantage, as one former reality-show producer noted: it's cheap to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a production cost of only about $750,000 for an hour (in part because the millions in commitments for the business ventures come from the investment sharks, not the network) the show is such a bargain it could stay on the air even with less-than-stellar ratings, said the executive, who asked not to be identified in order to preserve relationships with the network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''America's Next Great Restaurant'' doesn't have the advantage of extremely low cost. NBC formed a partnership with Steve Ells, the founder of the <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill</span> chain, to create the show, which challenges chefs to endure tests to prove they are worthy of serious investment in their restaurant ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The network and Mr. Ells have committed to creating a new restaurant chain with the winner of the contest and have already started building three restaurants in what Mr. Telegdy called ''prime locations'' in New York, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Telegdy, who is British, hatched the restaurant idea partly because he too watched ''Dragon's Den'' on the BBC. He said the format seemed promising, but he wondered about the breadth of the appeal of some of the winning ideas, like an ankle bracelet that sends distress signals for an overboard yachter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whatever 21st century capitalism is in a kind of post-bank-apocalypse, post-bailout world, America can't forget it is really good at innovating and starting businesses,'' Mr. Telegdy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burnett said all the business people being portrayed on reality shows might help counter the persistent image on fictional television of the executive as a villain, though Mr. Cuban didn't entirely agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regular folks ''chasing the dream'' are the people worth watching, Mr. Cuban said. ''Everybody has that idea: this could be it. That's what people will empathize with and rally around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Big business people really are villains,'' he added. ''They're idiots. They nearly drove this country into a depression.''</p>

Small businesses still have trouble getting loans, and savers are still getting hammered by near zero interest rates. Joblessness remains high. State budgets are ravaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So whom have Washington policy makers singled out for help? Bank shareholders, including bank executives who are invariably big holders of stock in their banks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve recently gave the all-clear for several banks to increase dividends and expand share buybacks, among them <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. That's good news, at least in the short run for bank investors, but it is a dubious development for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dividend-boosting banks that were too big to fail before the crisis are even bigger now, while reforms to rein them in are under political attack even before they have been implemented. Sheer size and inadequate regulation -- the combination that led to the crisis -- argue for banks to use their earnings to build bigger capital cushions, not to pay dividends and repurchase shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Fed officials have concluded that many banks are safe and sound enough to pay out cash and still withstand a severe shock should one occur again. It's hard to share their confidence. Before it approved new dividends, the Fed required banks to test their crisis-readiness against several criteria, like elevated unemployment, but it did not release detailed results of the tests. Public data do not inspire confidence either. There is much debate over whether banks are valuing their mortgage assets correctly, and, by extension, whether they are adequately capitalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is known is that recent bank profits have been boosted not by increasing revenues, but by downward revisions to expected future losses. With house prices falling anew, further reducing the value of mortgage assets, how reasonable is that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if banks were ready for anything, more dividends and buybacks still would be premature. Big banks that plan to increase payouts still hold nearly $120 billion in government-backed debt under a crisis-era program from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>. The subsidized bonds come due between now and the end of 2012. Paying shareholders before the bonds are retired puts bank investors before taxpayers -- talk about skewed priorities. Banks also face potentially huge fines in court cases and in settlement talks with government officials over mortgage and foreclosure practices that have harmed both homeowners and mortgage investors. It is irresponsible for the Fed to allow bolstered dividends before the penalties are known and paid. It is also a disturbing omen. Regulators are part of the settlement talks over the banks' wrongful practices. Are they assuming that banks can afford both stiff penalties and bolstered dividends? Or are they assuming that the penalties will be weak?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to redress and reward, bank shareholders should be at the back of the line, behind taxpayers who stand behind too-big-to-fail banks and behind homeowners who are bearing the brunt of a housing debacle for which banks bear considerable responsibility. For the Fed to allow new dividends and bigger buybacks before these issues are settled is a display of the same type of ''banks first'' favoritism that got us into this mess to start.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, Riccardo Romero could not find a bank to finance his first restaurant, so he ended up opening the Arepas Cafe in Astoria, Queens, with money from friends and a $10,000 loan from Accion, a nonprofit microlender that has seeded small businesses across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Romero, a former truffle salesman, is expanding the cafe into a space next door with a second loan provided through Accion, bringing him one step closer to his dream of dotting the country with Arepas Cafes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this time, the $10,000 loan came with an unusual pedigree: a program -- reserved for food, beverage and hospitality businesses -- started by the <span class="companylink">Boston Beer Company</span>, which makes Samuel Adams. It is almost like a special bank for artisanal pickles and beer, courtesy of a town New Yorkers love to hate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not going to do any microlending to the New York Yankees, so that's O.K.,'' Jim Koch, the company's brewer and founder, said, laughing. And helping other small businesses -- even other craft brewers -- keeps his company in the mind-set of a start-up and close to its entrepreneurial roots, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although microlending is a well-established practice, focusing on hospitality alone is unusual. But the need is great: food and beverage ventures can have trouble finding financing from conventional banks because they are risky, and aspiring owners often lack collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accion, said the chief executive, Paul Quintero, considers factors like projected cash flow and how applicants have handled credit in the past -- both the highs and lows -- but not collateral. And in working with <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span>, the lender hopes to double the proportion of its loans that go to the hospitality sector, to 30 percent from 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program, called Brewing the American Dream and started in New England in 2008, is now expanding to New York City, as well as to Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far, 53 businesses have received a total of $540,000, and officials hope to lend at least $250,000 throughout the five boroughs by the end of this year. The loans generally range from $700 to $25,000, and are to be paid back between seven months and five years at an interest rate of 8.99 to 15.99 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In today's world, people know one thing about banks: They say, O.K., they're not lending, so they assume that no one's lending, and that's false,'' Mr. Quintero said. ''What's coming to New York is a program that we know has been effective, it's had success, it resonates with entrepreneurs, and we'd like to have the New York City entrepreneurs be as competitive and have just the same access to capital as what we've been doing in New England.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koch was inspired both by his difficulties raising capital for a craft beer company 27 years ago -- back when the idea of a microbrewery ''was a little bit crazy, and you just could not get a loan'' -- and his frustration with standard corporate philanthropic activities, like spending a day painting a community center near his offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the expenditure of resources, he said -- maybe $1,000 worth of painting and $5,000 worth of time and expertise -- the result did not seem worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm supposed to be creating value,'' he said. ''I'm a business, I'm supposed to make two and two equal eight, not two and two equal one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in addition to lending money, the program offers seminars that are open to recipients as well as other small businesses needing advice on the nuts and bolts of operating their companies, like where to find specialty grains or how to develop a marketing plan. Staff members from <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span>, including Mr. Koch, plan to begin holding the ''speed-coaching'' sessions in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Mr. Romero, the first business owner in New York to receive a loan under the program, has big plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He celebrated the grand opening of his new Arepas Cafe space on Friday, which will add 15 or 20 seats to the 35 he already has. He hopes that will increase his revenue by 40 percent and allow him to open a cafe in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans are important, Mr. Romero said, but so is the coaching and advice that come along with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't know exactly how to put the money or where to put the money correctly,'' he said of when he started out. ''But now I feel more comfortable putting the money in expansion and making a better place for my customers.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has joined <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, as a part-time special adviser, <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span> announced late Tuesday. In addition to coaching and advising entrepreneurs, she will help evaluate new digital investments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span> is among the most well-known venture capital firms, with early investments in successes like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>. More recently, it has invested in Twitter and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, which makes online video games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hiring of Ms. Whitman, a Republican, adds to <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span>'s political pedigree. Former Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, is a partner while former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, is described as a ''strategic limited partner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Whitman won the Republican primary for California governor last year, but lost by a wide margin in the general election to Jerry Brown, a former governor. She spent more than $160 million, most of it from her own fortune, on the failed venture. She remains, nevertheless, a billionaire. Prior to running for office, Ms. Whitman led <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for 10 years, starting when it was a start-up with only 30 employees. During her tenure, the company became a global colossus, although it struggled with slow growth during the last couple of years that she was there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Meg helped build <span class="companylink">eBay</span> into one of the leading players in online commerce,'' Ted Schlein, a venture capitalist with <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span>, said in a statement. ''Her experience and strategic advice will be invaluable to entrepreneurs who are rapidly changing the way business is done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of her role, the question will inevitably be whether Ms. Whitman can pick winning companies from the losers. Her record at <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, at least in terms of acquisitions, was mixed. EBay's acquisition of online payment service <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> in 2002 is considered one of Ms. Whitman's wisest business decisions as a chief executive. Acquiring online calling service Skype in 2006, in contrast, was a failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since losing the governor's race, Ms. Whitman has gradually added new responsibilities, joining the boards of <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> (she had left that board while running for governor) and <span class="companylink">Zipcar</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADISON AVENUE will never be confused with Silicon Alley, much less Silicon Valley. But increasingly, agencies are trying to channel their inner entrepreneurs by pursuing ventures outside the realm of traditional advertising tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agencies are opening units aimed at selling products to consumers. Others are acting like venture capital firms, offering seed money to start-ups in fields like technology. Still other agencies are taking stakes in client companies and sharing in the revenue of merchandise sales.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has been going on for some time, led by smaller, newer agencies along with some agencies based in London, where unconventional behavior has long been prized. Now it is expanding to larger, more established outfits like Horizon Media, the biggest independent media agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horizon is forming a subsidiary, appropriately named New Horizons, that is investing in fledgling consumer-product companies. The initial investment is in Frederique's Choice, an online business specializing in flowers that was founded by the Dutch model Frederique van der Wal. Two additional investments are being considered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons is taking what Bill Koenigsberg, president and chief executive at Horizon in New York, described as a significant minority stake in Frederique's Choice, and Horizon will handle its marketing and media services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm an entrepreneur,'' said Mr. Koenigsberg, who founded Horizon in 1989, ''and the entrepreneur in me is always thinking about how to use the assets of the company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. van der Wal said: ''I know how key media and advertising are in my business. Bill and his team have experience with many different companies. Blending our strengths together will make this a success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Horizons will complement, not supplant or distract from, Horizon's mainstay operations, Mr. Koenigsberg said, ''because of the media involvement we'll have'' with the companies in which the unit will invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't take our eye off the ball,'' he added. ''If anything, it makes us smarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sentiment was echoed by Edward Brojerdi, co-chief creative officer at Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal &amp; Partners in New York, a unit of <span class="companylink">MDC Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a time of start-up communities and venture capital buzz, it gives us a chance to walk the walk,'' Mr. Brojerdi said, and ''find out what our creative output is worth out on the street, outside the traditional agency model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Brojerdi started a boutique division of <span class="companylink">Kirshenbaum Bond</span> Senecal called Spies and Assassins, specializing in developing ''our own intellectual property and marketing it directly to consumers,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been more than 50,000 downloads of the division's first product, Mr. Brojerdi said, a free mobile application named Twit Hit. The next product, an animated game for the iPad named Monster Maker, is to cost about $3.99, he added, and be followed by ancillary merchandise like coloring books, toys and stickers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This allows us to get learnings on research-and-development and monetization,'' Mr. Brojerdi said, adding that at least two additional products with price tags -- a puzzle game and an iPad app aimed at creative employees at agencies -- are in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKinney, an agency in Durham, N.C., undertook an initiative last year known as the McKinney Ten Percent, modeled after technology companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span> that let employees devote part of their work day to personal, entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an itch that needed to be scratched,'' said Jim Russell, partner and director for digital strategy at McKinney. ''If there's not an entrepreneurial spirit, an understanding that employees need to play and experiment, it becomes a very static environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of thinking and talking about what's next and what's new, it's 'construct and do,' '' he added. ''When an idea has potential and promise, we put resources against it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first result of the initiative is a program that aggregates comments on Twitter about related subjects. The initial version, called Crows Nest, is online at crowwwsnest.com, offering the top 10 links from the Twitter posts of ''the 250 most influential tweeters in advertising, design and technology,'' Mr. Russell said, updated every 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program is also being used by a McKinney client, the <span class="companylink">CenturyLink</span> Business unit of <span class="companylink">CenturyLink</span>. On Monday, <span class="companylink">CenturyLink</span> Business began offering its customers Trend IT, an aggregation of Twitter links on the subject of information technology. It can be found online at trendittool.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a revolution,'' said Cindy Humphrey, vice president for product and marketing at <span class="companylink">CenturyLink</span> Business in Denver, because McKinney ''is looking beyond me as a client and into my client base and what they need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Ms. Humphrey said, ''I see using technology to gather information as part of advertising, so I don't see this as separate'' from the more traditional services that McKinney provides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russell would not argue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm absolutely not saying the traditional craft of making ads that cause consumer attachment to a brand is ever going away,'' Mr. Russell said. ''But you need to have a wider definition; we just need to open our minds.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kimball Thomas and Davis Smith, co-founders of the e-commerce site Baby.com.br, had just six hours in Brazil to pitch to prospective investors and recruit a promising executive for the chief operating officer role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little time left after a four-hour meeting with Monashees Capital, the prospective candidate, In Hsieh, agreed to drive the entrepreneurs back to the airport for his interview, braving the city's notoriously congested roads as he answered their questions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas and Mr. Smith, who are cousins, made their evening flight, and Mr. Smith got home in time for his final exam at business school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Between my redeye flights, I didn't have time to study,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But I realized, the whole reason I went back to school was to build a business like this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith, who attends the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Thomas, of Harvard Business School, are part of a growing number of business school students rejecting traditional postgraduate paths like investment banking, hedge funds and consulting. It's a trend that is accelerating in the wake of the financial crisis as Wall Street loses its luster and Silicon Valley shines with a new crop of multibillion-dollar start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Harvard, some of Mr. Thomas's classmates are applying their entrepreneurial ambitions to technology ventures. Kevin Nazemi, a former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> product manager, started Done, a personal productivity service, last year. Daniel Gulati, a student who helped Mr. Thomas draft his early investor presentations, founded the retail site Fashionstake.com with a fellow classmate, Vivian Weng. Graduates from the class of 2010 started 30 to 40 businesses last year, a 50 percent increase from the previous year, said William A. Sahlman, a professor of entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The level of entrepreneurship activity here, and I presume at other schools, is up dramatically over the last two years,'' said Dr. Sahlman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baby.com.br is the second start-up for Mr. Thomas, 31, and Mr. Smith, 32. In 2004, the students started PoolTables.com, with about $20,000 scraped together from friends and family. The venture - which taught them the basics, like how to coordinate with vendors in China and how to run an e-commerce site - was profitable in its first year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the two are tackling a broader, if more complicated market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas and Mr. Smith got the idea for Baby.com.br after Mr. Thomas tried to find diapers for his son, Jack, during a family trip to Rio de Janeiro last year. He had to visit three stores to find a package of Pampers in the right size. Struck by the lack of high-quality baby care goods, Mr. Thomas saw an opportunity in Brazil's fast-growing market, where more than three million babies are born every year, according to data from the World Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up follows a similar strategy to Quidsi, the owner of Diapers.com. That site, also co-founded by a Wharton graduate, has attracted more than a million parents in the United States with free shipping on goods for their children. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> snapped up Quidsi for $545 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We actually see a lot more potential for e-commerce in Brazil,'' said Mr. Thomas, the start-up's co-chief executive. ''E-commerce there is so much more nascent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, they face more challenges than with their previous site, including a different regulatory and tax regime than in the United States. In Brazil, the payment processing system is also more fragmented. The plan is to start the service in July, but Mr. Thomas says they may have to push it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, inside the school and out, have taken notice. In late April, Baby.com.br was named one of the top three winners for the Harvard's annual Business Plan Contest, which came with a $25,000 cash prize. The award is on top of the $3 million that Mr. Thomas and Mr. Smith raised in February. That fund-raising effort, which valued the company at $5.6 million, included several well-known venture capitalists, including Monashees Capital and Ron Conway of SV Angel, who has stakes in Twitter and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Harvard carries some distinction, you can catch some people's eyes,'' said Mr. Thomas, referring to prospective investors. ''On the margin, if they can, they get back to you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contest is part of a broader effort by the school to foster innovation. Last year, budding entrepreneurs at Harvard formed the Startup Tribe, a student group. The organization, which has more than 150 members, persuaded Harvard to start the Minimum Viable Product Fund, a $50,000 fund for new start-ups. The program distributes awards of roughly $5,000 apiece to promising teams, including the nine winners announced in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're a scrappy, adaptive community'' said Andrew Rosenthal, a member of the Startup Tribe. The group has been gaining traction, because of a confluence of factors. ''We have a new dean, an active network of recent graduates, who are providing mentorship, and there's a strong demand for a student-run community,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school is also planning to open in the fall the Harvard Innovation Lab, a student center for start-ups, where founders can work with peers and Harvard's entrepreneurs-in-residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, business school can also be a significant hurdle for passionate founders. Mr. Thomas admits that his grades probably suffered last semester, as he struggled to juggle his classes with investor and client meetings in Brazil, San Francisco and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, he's catching his breath. Mr. Thomas, who is graduating this month, finished school on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm quite relieved that classes are over,'' he said. ''I have a trip to Brazil next week.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration's special stimulus-funded loan program, known as America's Recovery Capital, may be gone, but the controversy surrounding it lingers. In March, the agency's independent Inspector General released a report estimating that of the 4,559 A.R.C. loans made through January 2010, nearly half ''were not originated and closed in compliance with S.B.A.'s policies and procedures, resulting in approximately $66.5 million in inappropriate loan approvals.'' If those loans default, the report warns, the banks that made them should not expect to be fully repaid by the S.B.A.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A.R.C. loan program was conceived as a lifeline for sound businesses navigating the ragged shoals of recession. Companies could borrow up to $35,000 to retire existing debt, defer payments on the new loan for a year, and then take five more years to repay the obligation - with no interest or fees charged to the borrower. (The government would pay those.) The S.B.A. estimated that it had enough money to fund about 10,000 loans, and some observers predicted the program would be fully subscribed within a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many bankers were wary from the outset, and within two months of the program's inauguration, it became clear that lenders were not eager to participate. In part that was because all of the required underwriting work made the loans not very profitable, if not unprofitable. But bankers also worried that standards for determining eligibility were untenable - businesses had to be both, in the language of the law, ''viable'' yet ''experiencing immediate financial hardship'' - and that the government would try to wrangle out of its obligation to make good on defaulted debt. ''While the loan is 100 percent guaranteed, it's only 100 percent guaranteed if you follow all of the underwriting guidelines, and some of those guidelines are very fuzzy,'' Bob Seiwert, of the American Bankers Association, told The Times in August 2009. ''If you miss one, you put your whole loan at risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the program expired at the end of last September, only 8,869 loans for $287 million had been made, well short of the amount of money available for lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the bankers' fears appear well-founded. The inspector general's audit found that among what it called ''material origination and closing deficiencies,'' one in four loans went to borrowers who could not adequately show they were viable. One in 10 loans went to businesses that could not prove hardship - in some cases, the investigators found, ''the financial information actually contradicted the claimed financial hardship.'' And, the report noted pointedly, ''the S.B.A. is released from liability on the guaranty, in whole or in part, if the lender fails to comply materially with any of the provisions of the regulations'' or does not otherwise act ''in a prudent manner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A., responding to the audit, defended its lenders and insisted that the law gave the agency the flexibility to waive the procedures so long as ''the intent of the provision was met'' and making the loan ''did not violate the law.'' And because the inspector general did not give banks the opportunity to correct mistakes, the agency said, ''the true extent of the deficiencies is not known.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of whether the inspector general's estimates of errors prove accurate - and mistakes in underwriting don't necessarily lead to a default - the report shows just how fraught efforts to intervene and save small businesses from the jaws of recession can be. Bob Coleman, who publishes a newsletter for the S.B.A. lending industry, noted that the S.B.A. inspector general received additional funding to investigate regular 7(a) loans that were made with 90 percent guarantees and reduced fees that, like the A.R.C. loans, were also funded by the Recovery Act. ''More audits like this one will continue,'' he warned readers recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the S.B.A. continues to try to burnish A.R.C.'s reputation. Recently the agency named tiny Peoples Bank of Mississippi of Mendenhall, Miss., one of its Lenders of the Year in the agency's flagship general business, or 7(a), loan program. (There are two awards, one for large lenders and one for smaller institutions.) The award, according to the nomination guidelines, recognizes ''lenders that have used S.B.A. loan programs to help the maximum number of small-business owners obtain financing that they need to grow their businesses.'' Among the criteria for selection are growth in overall loan volume and reaching ''underserved'' (read: disadvantaged) borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peoples Bank saw decent growth in the dollars it lent last year, but it was hardly among the biggest gainers, and at the end of the year ranked only 156th among 7(a) lenders. What distinguishes Peoples Bank from the rest of the pack, as alert Agenda readers may remember, is its prodigious A.R.C. loan lending. By the time the program ended, Peoples had funded 292 loans - more than any other bank save giants <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and West Coast regional powerhouse <span class="companylink">Zions First National Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, said Dennis Ammann, Peoples president and chief executive, the portfolio seems to be holding up well. True, fewer than 40 borrowers have begun repaying their A.R.C. loans, but only two borrowers have shuttered. ''The others seem to be doing well,'' Mr. Ammann said. ''They're all current on this debt, if they've started making payments, or if they have other debt, they're current on that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of these folks just needed that cash-flow help. That was the biggest thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

So, in appreciation, I wanted to give a big policy speech outside on a really hot day. (Laughter.) Those of you who are still wearing your jackets, feel free to take them off. I hope everybody is wearing sunscreen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE MEMBER: We live here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: You say you live here? You don't need it, huh? (Laughter.) Well, it is a great honor to be here. And I want to express my appreciation to all of you for taking the time to come out today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know, about a week ago, I delivered a commencement address at Miami Dade Community College, which is one of the most diverse schools in the nation. The graduates were proud that their class could claim heritage from 181 countries around the world -- 181 countries. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the students were immigrants themselves, coming to America with little more than the dream of their parents and the clothes on their back. A handful had discovered only in adolescence or adulthood that they were undocumented. But they worked hard and they gave it their all, and so they earned those diplomas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the ceremony, 181 flags -- one for every nation that was represented -- was marched across the stage. And each one was applauded by the graduates and the relatives with ties to those countries. So when the Haitian flag went by, all the Haitian kids -- Haitian American kids shouted out. And when the Guatemalan flag went by, all the kids of Guatemalan heritage shouted out. And when the Ukrainian flag went by, I think one kid shouted out. (Laughter.) This was down in Miami. (Laughter.) If it had been in Chicago, there would have been more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, the last flag, the American flag, came into view. And everyone in the room erupted in applause. Everybody cheered. (Applause.) So, yes, their parents and grandparents -- some of the graduates themselves -- had come from every corner of the globe. But it was here that they had found opportunity. It was here that they had a chance to contribute to the nation that is their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it was a reminder of a simple idea, as old as America itself: E pluribus unum. Out of many, one. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those willing to embrace America's ideals and America's precepts. That's why millions of people, ancestors to most of us, braved hardship and great risk to come here -- so they could be free to work and worship and start a business and live their lives in peace and prosperity. The Asian immigrants who made their way to California's Angel Island. The German and Scandinavians who settled across the Midwest. The waves of Irish, and Italian, and Polish, and Russian, and Jewish immigrants who leaned against the railing to catch their first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This flow of immigrants has helped make this country stronger and more prosperous. (Applause.) We can point to the genius of Einstein, the designs of I. M. Pei, the stories of Isaac Asimov, the entire industries that were forged by Andrew Carnegie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then when I think about immigration I think about the naturalization ceremonies that we've held at the White House for members of our military. Nothing could be more inspiring. Even though they were not yet citizens when they joined our military, these men and women signed up to serve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We did one event at the White House and a young man named Granger Michael from Papua New Guinea, a Marine who had been deployed to Iraq three times, was there. And you know what he said about becoming an American citizen? He said, ''I might as well. I love this country already.'' That's all he said. Marines aren't big on speeches. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another was a woman named Perla Ramos who was born and raised in Mexico and came to the United States shortly after 9/11, and joined the Navy. And she said, ''I take pride in our flag and the history we write day by day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the promise of this country -- that anyone can write the next chapter in our story. It doesn't matter where you come from -- (applause) -- it doesn't matter where you come from; it doesn't matter what you look like; it doesn't matter what faith you worship. What matters is that you believe in the ideals on which we were founded; that you believe that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. (Applause.) All of us deserve our freedoms and our pursuit of happiness. In embracing America, you can become American. That is what makes this country great. That enriches all of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, at the same time, we're here at the border today -- (applause) -- we're here at the border because we also recognize that being a nation of laws goes hand in hand with being a nation of immigrants. This, too, is our heritage. This, too, is important. And the truth is, we've often wrestled with the politics of who is and who isn't allowed to come into this country. This debate is not new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, there has been fear and resentment directed towards newcomers, especially in hard economic times. And because these issues touch deeply on what we believe, touch deeply on our convictions -- about who we are as a people, about what it means to be an American -- these debates often elicit strong emotions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one reason it's been so difficult to reform our broken immigration system. When an issue is this complex, when it raises such strong feelings, it's easier for politicians to defer until the problem the next election. And there's always a next election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we've seen a lot of blame and a lot of politics and a lot of ugly rhetoric around immigration. And we've seen good faith efforts from leaders of both parties -- by the way, I just noticed, those of you who have chairs, if you want to sit down, feel free. There's no rule about having to stand when I'm --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE MEMBER: -- we love you! (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: But we've seen leaders of both parties who try to work on this issue, but then their efforts fell prey to the usual Washington games. And all the while, we've seen the mounting consequences of decades of inaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants here in the United States. Some crossed the border illegally. Others avoid immigration laws by overstaying their visas. Regardless of how they came, the overwhelming majority of these folks are just trying to earn a living and provide for their families. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we have to acknowledge they've broken the rules. They've cut in front of the line. And what is also true is that the presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who are trying to immigrate legally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, because undocumented immigrants live in the shadows, where they're vulnerable to unscrupulous businesses that skirt taxes, and pay workers less than the minimum wage, or cut corners with health and safety laws, this puts companies who follow the rules, and Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime or just a safe place to work, it puts those businesses at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. Over the past decade, even before the recession hit, middle-class families were struggling to get by as the costs went up for everything, from health care, to college tuition, to groceries, to gas. Their incomes didn't go up with those prices. We're seeing it again right now with gas prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So one way to strengthen the middle class in America is to reform the immigration system so that there is no longer a massive underground economy that exploits a cheap source of labor while depressing wages for everybody else. I want incomes for middle-class families to rise again. (Applause.) I want prosperity in this country to be widely shared. (Applause.) I want everybody to be able to reach that American dream. And that's why immigration reform is an economic imperative. It's an economic imperative. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And reform will also help to make America more competitive in the global economy. Today, we provide students from around the world with visas to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or a new industry here in the United States. Instead of training entrepreneurs to stay here, we train them to create jobs for our competition. That makes no sense. In a global marketplace, we need all the talent we can attract, all the talent we can get to stay here to start businesses -- not just to benefit those individuals, but because their contribution will benefit all Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at Intel, look at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, look at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, look at <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. All those great American companies, all the jobs they've created, everything that has helped us take leadership in the high-tech industry, every one of those was founded by, guess who, an immigrant. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we don't want the next Intel or the next <span class="companylink">Google</span> to be created in China or India. We want those companies and jobs to take root here. (Applause.) Bill Gates gets this. He knows a little something about the high-tech industry. He said, ''The United States will find it far more difficult to maintain its competitive edge if it excludes those who are able and willing to help us compete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So immigration is not just the right thing to do. It's smart for our economy. It's smart for our economy. (Applause.) And it's for this reason that businesses all across America are demanding that Washington finally meet its responsibilities to solve the immigration problem. Everybody recognizes the system is broken. The question is, will we finally summon the political will to do something about it? And that's why we're here at the border today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I want to say I am joined today by an outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, who's been working tirelessly on this issue. (Applause.) Our commissioner who's working diligently on border issues, Alan Bersin, is there, and we appreciate him -- Bersin. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they're doing outstanding work. And in recent years, among one of the greatest impediments to reform were questions about border security. And these were legitimate concerns. What was true was a lack of manpower and a lack of resources at the border, combined with the pull of jobs and ill-considered enforcement once folks were in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this contributed to a growing number of undocumented people living in the United States. And these concerns helped unravel a bipartisan coalition that we had forged back when I was in the United States Senate. So in the years since, ''borders first, borders first,'' that's become the common refrain, even among those who were previously supportive of comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet and Alan and everybody who's down here working at the border, we've answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. It's a build-up that began under President Bush and that we've continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they wanted a fence. Well, the fence is --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE: Booo!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: The fence is now basically complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE MEMBER: Tear it down!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: Then we've gone further. We tripled the number of intelligence analysts working at the border. I've deployed unmanned aerial vehicles to patrol the skies from Texas to California. We have forged a partnership with Mexico to fight the transnational criminal organizations that have affected both of our countries. (Applause.) And for the first time -- for the first time we're screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south even as we go after drugs that are coming north. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, here's the point. I want everybody to listen carefully to this. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we've done. But even though we've answered these concerns, I've got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE MEMBER: They're racist!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they're going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they'll want a higher fence. Maybe they'll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They'll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That's politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the truth is the measures we've put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn't accept any violence or crime. And we've always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it's not getting reported on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we're also going beyond the border. Beyond the border, we're going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law. (Applause.) And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that's a tough issue. It's a source of controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I want to emphasize we're not doing it haphazardly. We're focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we've increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to ignore the real human toll of a broken immigration system. Even as we recognize that enforcing the law is necessary, we don't relish the pain that it causes in the lives of people who are just trying to get by and get caught up in the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as long as the current laws are on the books, it's not just hardened felons who are subject to removal, but sometimes families who are just trying to earn a living, or bright, eager students, or decent people with the best of intentions. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what I'm committed to doing. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, we can! Yes, we can!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we can. We can do it. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUDIENCE: Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PRESIDENT: The most significant step we can now take to secure the borders is to fix the system as a whole so that fewer people have the incentive to enter illegally in search of work in the first place. This would allow agents to focus on the worst threats on both of our -- both sides of our borders, from drug traffickers to those who would come here to commit acts of violence or terror. That's where our focus should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, El Paso, the question is whether those in Congress who previously walked away in the name of enforcement are now ready to come back to the table and finish the work that we've started. (Applause.) We've got to put the politics aside. And if we do, I'm confident we can find common ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington is lagging behind the country on this. There is already a growing coalition of leaders across America who don't always see eye-to-eye, but are coming together on this issue. They see the harmful consequences of a broken immigration system for their businesses and for their communities, and they understand why we need to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are Democrats and Republicans, people like former Republican Senator Mel Martinez; former Bush administration Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; leaders like Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; evangelical ministers like Leith Anderson and Bill Hybels; police chiefs from across the nation; educators; advocates; labor unions; chambers of commerce; small business owners; Fortune 500 CEOs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I mean, one CEO had this to say about reform: ''American ingenuity is a product of the openness and diversity of this society. Immigrants have made America great as the world leader in business, in science, higher education and innovation.'' You know who that leader was? Rupert Murdoch, who owns FOX News, and is an immigrant himself. I don't know if you're familiar with Rupert Murdoch's views, but let's just say he doesn't have an Obama sticker on his car. (Laughter.) But he agrees with me on this. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there is a consensus around fixing what's broken. And now we need Congress to catch up. Now we need to come together around reform that reflects our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; reform that demands that everybody take responsibility. So what would comprehensive reform look like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, we know that government has a threshold responsibility to secure our borders and enforce the law. And that's what Janet and all her folks are doing. That's what they're doing. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, businesses have to be held accountable if they exploit undocumented workers. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, those who are here illegally, they have a responsibility as well. So they broke the law, and that means they've got to pay their taxes, they've got to pay a fine, they've got to learn English. And they've got to undergo background checks and a lengthy process before they get in line for legalization. That's not too much to ask. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And fourth, stopping illegal immigration also depends on reforming our outdated system of legal immigration. (Applause.) We should make it easier for the best and the brightest to not only stay here, but also to start businesses and create jobs here. In recent years, a full 25 percent of high-tech startups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. That led to 200,000 jobs here in America. I'm glad those jobs are here. I want to see more of them created in this country. We need to provide them the chance. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to provide our farms a legal way to hire workers that they rely on, and a path for those workers to earn legal status. (Applause.) And our laws should respect families following the rules -- reuniting them more quickly instead of splitting them apart. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the immigration system not only tolerates those who break the rules, but it punishes folks who follow the rules. While applications -- while applicants wait for approval, for example, they're often forbidden from visiting the United States. Even husbands and wives may have to spend years apart. Parents can't see their children. I don't believe the United States of America should be in the business of separating families. That's not right. That's not who we are. We can do better than that. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. (Applause.) We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education or serve in the military. And that's why we need to pass the DREAM Act. (Applause.) Now, we passed the DREAM Act through the House last year when Democrats were in control. But even though it received a majority of votes in the Senate, it was blocked when several Republicans who had previously supported the DREAM Act voted no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a tremendous disappointment to get so close and then see politics get in the way. And as I gave that commencement at Miami Dade, it broke my heart knowing that a number of those promising, bright students -- young people who worked so hard and who speak about what's best in America -- are at risk of facing the agony of deportation. These are kids who grew up in this country. They love this country. They know no other place to call home. The idea that we'd punish them is cruel. It makes no sense. We're a better nation than that. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we're going to keep fighting for the DREAM Act. We're going to keep up the fight for reform. (Applause.) And that's where you come in. I'm going to do my part to lead a constructive and civil debate on these issues. And we've already had a series of meetings about this at the White House in recent weeks. We've got leaders here and around the country helping to move the debate forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this change ultimately has to be driven by you, the American people. You've got to help push for comprehensive reform, and you've got to identify what steps we can take right now -- like the DREAM Act, like visa reform -- areas where we can find common ground among Democrats and Republicans and begin to fix what's broken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I'm asking you to add your voices to this debate. You can sign up to help at whitehouse.gov. We need Washington to know that there is a movement for reform that's gathering strength from coast to coast. That's how we'll get this done. That's how we can ensure that in the years ahead we are welcoming the talents of all who can contribute to this country and that we're living up to the basic American idea that you can make it here if you try. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the idea that gave hope to Jose Hernandez. Is Jose here? Where's -- Jose is right over there. (Applause.) I want you to hear -- I want you to think about this story. Jose's parents were migrant farm workers. And so, growing up, he was too. He was born in California, though he could have just as easily been born on the other side of the border, if it had been a different time of year, because his family moved around with the seasons. So two of his siblings were actually born in Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they traveled a lot, and Jose joined his parents picking cucumbers and strawberries. And he missed part of school when they returned to Mexico each winter. Jose didn't learn English until he was 12 years old. But you know what, Jose was good at math and he liked math. And the nice thing is that math was the same in every school, and it's the same in Spanish as it is in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Jose studied, and he studied hard. And one day, he's standing in the fields, collecting sugar beets, and he heard on a transistor radio that a man named Franklin Chang-Diaz -- a man with a surname like his -- was going to be an astronaut for NASA. So Jose decided -- right there in the field, he decided -- well, I could be an astronaut, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Jose kept on studying, and he graduated high school. And he kept on studying, and he earned an engineering degree. And he kept on studying, and he earned a graduate degree. And he kept on working hard, and he ended up at a national laboratory, helping to develop a new kind of digital medical imaging system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a few years later, he found himself more than 100 miles above the surface of the Earth, staring out of the window of the shuttle Discovery, and he was remembering the boy in the California fields with that crazy dream that in America everything is possible. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about that, El Paso. That's the American Dream right there. (Applause.) That's what we're fighting for. We are fighting for every boy and every girl like Jose with a dream and potential that's just waiting to be tapped. We are fighting to unlock that promise, and all that holds not just for their futures, but for America's future. That's why we're going to get this done. And that's why I'm going to need your help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)</p>

Read Newton or Einstein. Or you could play Portal 2, the achingly brilliant new game from the <span class="companylink">Valve Corporation</span> that wrings more fun out of physics than all of the shoot-'em-ups in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warning: This is a brain game. If you don't consider thinking hard to be an entertainment experience, Portal 2 is not for you. It will not test your reflexes or eye-hand coordination. What it will test, in knee-slapping and grin-inducing fashion, is your mind.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with physics for many people is that it has always been explained in the language of mathematics. And while some folks can understand and even ''speak'' math at the level where nuance and beauty emerge (somewhere around integral calculus), a lot of us can't. Instead, thinking of physics conjures nightmarish flashbacks of high school memorization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the brain seems to understand this science at a basic level. Gently toss a ball to a dog or a small child, and he or she will catch it without the faintest conscious understanding of acceleration, momentum and gravity. Throw the same ball as hard as you can, and that dog or child will try to defend against it or dodge, instinctively understanding complex calculations of velocity and potential impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, we all know physics, even if we don't know we know it. But how can it be made elegant and enjoyable without the math?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Portal 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valve released the original Portal in 2007 as part of a five-game bundle. This version -- released recently for Windows, Mac OS, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 -- is the full-fledged standalone sequel. The premise is that you are a woman trapped in the distant future in an abandoned robot factory buried miles beneath the Midwestern plains. The only other characters you encounter are two deranged artificial intelligences vying for control of the complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You must escape to the surface. And that requires navigating not only vast underground landscapes but also a series of meticulously designed test chambers that the robots have devised to measure human intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To achieve that you have two tools: your brain and the device called the portal gun, a unique concept in video games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is going to sound complicated, but stay with me. The portal gun emits a beam that can create two different portals -- a blue one or an orange one -- on a flat environmental surface, like a wall, floor or ceiling. You point the gun at, say, a wall across the room and pull either the blue trigger or the orange trigger, and the beam comes out, and the portal appears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One portal by itself does nothing; it is merely a swirling oval about the height and width of an adult. But when you create the other portal, the two ovals become linked. When you pass through one, you emerge from the other, no matter how far away it is. It is as if the portals formed opposite sides of a trans-dimensional hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's say you are in a rectangular test chamber, standing on a platform separated from the exit by a deep pit that you cannot possibly leap over. All you have to do is create one portal on a wall next to you, then fire the gun across the chasm to create the corresponding portal on a wall next to the exit. You walk through the hole beside you and pop out by your destination. Voila.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's easy, and that's pretty much where you start in Portal 2. The game then begins to layer on more mind-bending situations that both elucidate, and take advantage of, basic physics. For example, an important concept is the conservation of momentum. When you enter one portal, you emerge from the corresponding portal at exactly the same speed. This means that gravity becomes your personal propulsion system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picture the same test chamber, but with one difference: the walls, floors and ceiling by the exit are not ''portal-able.'' Certain surfaces are designed to be impervious to the portal effect. How will you cross?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First you open a portal that's above and behind you on the wall. Against all intuition, you then leap into the pit. As you fall, accelerating, you aim at the floor and open a portal where you are about to land and plummet through, only to be launched horizontally out of the portal you originally created. Your speed propels you across the pit to land by the exit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may sound impossibly complex and not at all fun. But Portal 2 is doing the math for you. Moreover, the game is presenting these puzzles in virtual three-dimensional environments that tap into our intuitive understanding of physics. Just as important, the game wraps these puzzles in a mordantly hilarious story line (who doesn't like crazy robots?) distinguished by pitch-perfect voice acting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere out there an innovative, dynamic high school physics teacher will use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately become the most important science teacher those lucky students have ever had. For those of us who have left school behind, Portal 2 is one of the finest brain games around.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an idea gets hot in Silicon Valley, scores of entrepreneurs come up with me-too ideas to try to get some of the money sloshing around. Why else are there so many photo-sharing apps, geolocation services and social networks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raptr might seem like one of those companies that has sliced the salami pretty thin. It is a social network for gamers, with about 8 million of them. The name lacks a few vowels, as those of so many Silicon Valley start-ups do. It has no visible source of revenue. And it has raised more than $27 million from venture capitalists, including some of the same folks who staked <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But something else is going on here. It is really a data collection company. The gamers who sign up for Raptr use it to talk to other players, share information and coordinate play across any number of game platforms. ''You don't have to tell us you like World of Warcraft,'' says the site's founder and chief executive, Dennis Fong. ''We already know that.'' The service collects information about players, like what games are played, when they are played, with whom, for how long and what stage of the game they are in by monitoring the game systems being used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not tracking sales -- we are tracking usage,'' Mr. Fong said. The company knows all kinds of interesting facts, like the percentage of users who play both FarmVille and Madden football (about 20 percent) or what games get played less when a new game comes out. That's golden to game advertisers -- when Raptr starts taking advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is announcing Thursday that it has found something beneficial to do with all the data right now. It is going to cut the clutter of information that inundates players. It will start a social news platform, but filter the results so they are more relevant to people on the network. That's intriguing because what it does could be applied to other sorts of people who are inundated with information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are an Angry Birds player, you may want to see and share the crazy live-action videos people have created. But not if you like Portal 2. It goes beyond that. For example, if you were a player of World of Warcraft, you would probably be interested in information about the game. And there is a lot of information about the game that players are sharing. But is it relevant to you? That is where Raptr deploys what Mr. Fong calls ''an additional vector to filter out noise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you just bought the latest game, you'd be interested in tips, but a player in a game's final stages couldn't care less about that. That player would be far more interested in sequels. So Raptr will filter out news that only the newbies would find relevant, because it knows enough about the player's habits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it works, it could make life a whole lot easier for gamers because it could allow them to welcome new information, rather than turn it all off. ''We're a discovery engine for people who want to play games,'' Mr. Fong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since we are all overwhelmed by junk information -- irrelevant e-mail, pointless <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> updates, moronic Twitter postings and news stories about Kardashians -- anything that lets us get back into the flow if information to enjoy the serendipity of discovery has got to be a good thing.</p>

We wrote about some of the perks that start-ups were offering to potential employees to convince them to join their companies, including free meals, haircuts and even iPads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Hipster, a start-up in San Francisco that lets people post queries and answers to others in their geographic area using the Web and a mobile phone, is trying to attract fresh faces to its company with a particularly attention-getting offer -- $10,000 and a year's supply of beer. The company is also offering a bicycle, pair of oversized glasses, skinny jeans, a bowtie, mustache-grooming services and a pair of boots. The prize was designed to resonate with the company's name. The beer, of course, is PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon, for those who are not hip).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ludlow said the reward would be delivered to anyone hired through the campaign or to anyone who referred someone who was then hired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hipster, founded in January, raised $1 million in funding from a long list of prominent investors, including Google Ventures, Lightbank and Mitch Kapor, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, the service has around 6,000 users. The company is still testing its service in a few cities -- Boulder, Colo., and Austin, Tex. -- and is actively looking to hire a crew of engineers to flesh out its ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ludlow, who began the hiring campaign on Wednesday, said the company had already received 240 applications. Nearly half were related to marketing and sales, and roughly 40 percent were from developers. But the remaining 10 percent were from the most promising candidates, coming from Hipster's rivals and companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Twitter, SalesForce, <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> and AOL.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Chad Etzel and Paul Stamatiou began to raise additional money for their technology start-up in the fall of 2010, they were preparing for an investment frenzy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young entrepreneurs, who had already raised $200,000 for Notifo, their mobile notifications platform for businesses, used their contacts from the start-up incubator Y Combinator, along with the investor matchmaking site AngelList, to arrange nearly 40 meetings with venture capitalists, including some of the best-known investors in Silicon Valley. They set a goal at $300,000, later increasing the number to $500,000.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their second fund-raising drive was a flop. While Mr. Etzel and Mr. Stamatiou courted dozens of investors via Skype chats, conference calls and in-person meetings, they raised only a small fraction of the intended amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The hardest part is not hearing back,'' Mr. Stamatiou wrote of his investor meetings, in a blog post titled ''Startup Fundraising is a Time Sink.'' ''They would say they would get in touch next week, but nothing ever came.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of a social media boom that has flooded the technology sector with billions of dollars from wealthy individuals and venture capital firms looking for the next <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Groupon or LinkedIn, companies like Notifo may seem like anomalies, unlucky losers in an age of easy money. But Mr. Etzel and Mr. Stamatiou aren't alone. A rising tide in the tech start-up world has not lifted all boats, and some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are struggling to keep their companies afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the biggest trap in the start-up cycle are the so-called expansion rounds, investments of $5 million to $10 million that fledgling companies use to finance their growth. This stage, also referred to as Series B and C rounds, typically takes place 12 to 18 months after a company's initial round, or ''seed stage,'' but before big-name backers like <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span> and Sequoia Capital come on the scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This capital is critical to young companies that have exhausted most of their seed money but have yet to turn a significant profit. But investors are less willing to jump in at this point, looking instead for either brand-new ideas or proven companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's easier than it used to be to raise seed capital, and it's easier to raise growth-stage capital,'' said Jeffrey J. Bussgang, a partner at the Boston-based venture firm Flybridge Capital Partners. ''But there's a chasm in the middle, and that chasm is growing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital firms financed only 211 expansion rounds last quarter, compared with 269 expansion rounds in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to a MoneyTree report released by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> and the National Venture Capital Association. In all, companies in this stage raised $1.9 billion last quarter versus $2.5 billion the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all entrepreneurs are having trouble raising capital at this stage. Jon Dahl, the founder of an online video encoding start-up, Zencoder, raised $2 million this year from well-known venture capital firms including Andreessen-Horowitz and <span class="companylink">Ignition Partners</span>. Mr. Dahl, who also participated in Y Combinator in 2010, said that Zencoder's most recent fund-raising round had been oversubscribed, meaning that the company had to turn away money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expansion rounds have always been a fairly high bar, Mr. Dahl said. ''There could just be more people who are struggling with the high bar now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation may only get worse when hundreds of technology start-ups recently financed with early-stage investments begin looking for additional capital over the next two years. Adeo Ressi, founder of the venture capital reviewing site The Funded, has christened 2011 the Year of the Start-Up Default. He believes that the downturn in expansion-stage financing will hamper entrepreneurs' ability to pay back the debt owed to their earlier seed-stage investors and force them to close up shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There will be a washout in the later rounds,'' said Pano Anthos, founder of a start-up consulting firm, Guided Launch. ''Entrepreneurs think they're set because they have their seed round, but a seed round is just a ticket to the dance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anthos has experienced start-up failures first hand. His last tech company, a virtual world application called Hangout.net, was greeted with fanfare when it started in 2008, with some in Silicon Valley heralding the site as a potential successor to the online virtual world Second Life. But Hangout.net began to fizzle in 2009, following a burst of new competition that made it harder to woo investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's 13 social commerce start-ups and 14 inbox-solution start-ups,'' Mr. Anthos said of today's crowded Internet venture space. ''How many more of these can we have?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some see the dearth of expansion capital as a good thing, since it weeds out weaker, less viable companies. The process could help prevent the frenzied growth during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, when hundreds of companies with no profits and undeveloped business models went public only to flame out later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund-raising gap also has not dissuaded the legions of young programmers hoping to cash in on the current technology frenzy. Mr. Stamatiou, who declined to comment on Notifo's woes, said in a phone interview that he planned to remain involved in start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bussgang of Flybridge Capital, who also teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, has been warning his students about the difficulties of raising money even in a generous investing climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tell them, this is a game of musical chairs. And at some point, the music's going to stop.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the second in an occasional series on how business owners are succeeding and struggling with their technology needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business: Cannonball Wine (the name will be changing to Cannonball Winery), based in Healdsburg, Calif., is a five-person virtual winemaker. Rather than owning vineyards and processing facilities, the company contracts with various larger companies that provide grapes (mostly from Sonoma and Mendocino counties), as well as fermentation, aging, finishing, bottling and warehousing services, all to Cannonball's specifications. Founded four years ago with financing from the partners and their families and friends, as well as a Small Business Administration loan, the company is now shipping 35,000 cases of its Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot a year to wine stores and wholesalers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners: Dennis Hill started the company with Greg Ahn, a wine-industry marketing executive, and Yoav Gilat, who heads up sales. Mr. Hill, who has some 35 years of winemaking experience, was the top winemaker at Blackstone Winery, a pioneer of the virtual winery business model in the early 1990s. Now the model is an increasingly popular one, said Mr. Hill, and many vineyards and processing facilities all over Northern California are reorienting themselves to servicing virtual wineries. ''It's a much smarter way to do it,'' he said. ''We can focus our time and capital on overseeing production, building a brand and selling -- instead of on real estate and other expensive assets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sources of expertise: The partners handle their information technology on their own, without help from consultants or other specialists. Mr. Ahn is sort of the tech guy, by default, and he's knowledgeable about I.T., though not a pro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's working: Cannonball relies on the online version of QuickBooks for accounting, and on the online service <span class="companylink">Expensify</span> for tracking expenses -- especially those related to the extensive travels of Mr. Gilat and the company's salesperson but also for various small tools and other miscellaneous purchases Mr. Hill and his partners sometimes ring up on their charge cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for managing the heart of the operation -- the wine production, bottling and distribution -- the company needs specialized applications. ''There's a lot to keep track of,'' said Mr. Hill, ''and if we had to do it with spreadsheets it would be laborious.'' In order to control the winemaking process, as well as to be able to tell customers exactly what they're buying and to comply with federal alcoholic-beverage record-keeping requirements, Cannonball has to track every aspect of the product from the harvesting of the different grapes to when a bottle of wine leaves the warehouse for a customer. That gets pretty tricky, considering that a bottle of wine is actually a blend of different batches of wines that might each come from different types of grapes that have spent different amounts of time aging in different types of oak barrels -- with the process stretching out over four or so years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the companies that provide the various contract services have all set up Web-based tools that Mr. Hill and his partners can log into directly. ''We tie into five or six different systems,'' said Mr. Hill. ''I can find out exactly what's happening with each vintage and appellation at every step. I know which tanks or barrels each wine is in, what chemical analysis is coming back from the labs, and what aeration or other treatment the wine is getting or might need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the company has figured out: With partners and employees scattered across small offices and frequently on the road, the company has made a point of adopting online-based applications for easy collaboration. ''We haven't even looked at PC-based options,'' said Mr. Hill. Much of the work is done on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Apps, including e-mail, documents, calendars, chat and video conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill is sensitive to the fact that a virtual winery risks sacrificing some of the control that traditional winemakers can exercise by being on-site. He says he makes up for it by paying close attention to every detail he can wring out of the online systems and by staying in close touch with managers at the different facilities every step of the way -- by e-mail, by phone, and with frequent visits. ''I like to meet with them personally to make sure they understand everything I'm looking for, to discuss timing with them, and to do my own sampling,'' he said. ''It's really about developing good relationships with the people there, and giving them the support they need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's still causing pain: The applications for tracking wine that's aging in barrels don't always provide enough detail to make it easy for Mr. Hill to locate a particular barrel of wine. That can be a big problem when wine is moved, as is routine. The barrels are bar-coded and labeled, so it's not as if anything is going to be lost or mixed up, but hunting down barrels for a sampling can take up a chunk of a day if there's confusion. To cut down on the searching, Mr. Hill tries to work with the facilities to minimize the movement of wines and barrels. ''I wish I could have all the information about barrels right at my fingertips,'' he said, ''but I don't want to create a lot of cost by having to continually update that data.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also calling out for more attention are the company's Web site and social-media efforts. The Web site, for example, doesn't provide a list of retailers that carry Cannonball wines, which means that Mr. Hill and Co. spend a lot of time responding to consumer e-mails asking where they can buy. ''We'd love to get that list up,'' said Mr. Hill, ''but it's a lot of data to put in, and it would need constant updating.'' He says he expects they will bite the bullet and do it soon, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the company has several hundred fans on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and a few hundred followers on Twitter, but both Mr. Hill and Mr. Gilat feel they need to do a better job of posting frequently and building the fan base. ''We're reacting instead of being proactive,'' said Mr. Gilat. ''We get e-mail all the time from people who want to buy our wine and visit our winery, and at some point we may want to sell directly to consumers. We need to stay in contact with these people.'' Mr. Gilat has been letting fans and followers know of local wine tastings that Cannonball occasionally sponsors, but he wants to do a lot more of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does anyone have suggestions for Cannonball?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW HAVEN -- When Keila Fong arrived at Yale, she had never given much thought to computer science. But then last year everyone on campus started talking about the film ''The Social Network,'' and she began to imagine herself building something and starting a business that maybe, just maybe, could become the next <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's become very glamorous to become the next Mark Zuckerberg, and everyone likes to think they have some great idea,'' said Ms. Fong, a junior, who has since decided to major in Yale's newly energized computer science program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind that Mr. Zuckerberg, like other tech titans, did not major in computer science -- or even finish college. Enrollment in computer science programs, and degrees from them, are rising after a decade of decreases, despite much handwringing about the decline of American competitiveness in technology and innovation from President Obama on down. And educators and technologists say the inspiration is partly Hollywood's portrayal of the tech world, as well as celebrity entrepreneurs like Steven P. Jobs of Apple and Mr. Zuckerberg who make products that students use every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a national call, a Sputnik moment,'' said Mehran Sahami, associate chairman for computer science education at Stanford, referring to the Soviet satellite launching in 1957 that pushed the United States into the space race. ''Students are users of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">Google</span>, and they think about how the people who created it are not that much different than themselves. The realization that I can do this too is a powerful motivator.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of computer science degrees awarded in the United States began rising in 2010, and will reach 11,000 this year, after plummeting each year since the end of the dot-com bubble in 2004, according to the Computing Research Association, which tracks enrollment and degrees. Enrollment in the major peaked around 2000, with the most degrees -- 21,000 -- awarded four years later. The number of students who are pursuing the degree but have not yet declared their major increased by 50 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To capitalize on the growing cachet of the tech industry, colleges nationwide, including Stanford, the University of Washington and the University of Southern California, have recently revamped their computer science curriculums to attract iPhone and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>-obsessed students, and to banish the perception of the computer scientist as a geek typing code in a basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even universities not known for computer science or engineering, like Yale, are seizing the moment. The deans of the Ivy League engineering schools recently started meeting to hatch ways to market ''the Ivy engineer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new curriculums emphasize the breadth of careers that use computer science, as diverse as finance and linguistics, and the practical results of engineering, like iPhone apps, Pixar films and robots, a world away from the more theory-oriented curriculums of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The old-fashioned way of computer science is, 'We're going to teach you a bunch of stuff that is fundamental and will be long-lasting but we won't tell you how it's applied,' '' said Michael Zyda, director of the University of Southern California's GamePipe Laboratory, a new games program in the computer science major. With the rejuvenated classes, freshman enrollment in computer science at the university grew to 120 last year, from 25 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, computer science graduates do not come close to filling the jobs available. Technology is one of the few bright spots in the economy, with jobs growing at double the rate of job growth over all, according to federal statistics. And colleges say they do not have enough resources or professors to teach interested students. Meanwhile, the programs woefully lag in attracting women and many minorities, though the share of computer science degrees granted to women climbed 2.5 percentage points last year to 14 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vint Cerf, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s chief Internet evangelist, said that while mobile devices had fueled interest in building software, the excitement was nowhere near what he and his colleagues felt in the 1960s. ''It's still a problem,'' Mr. Cerf said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the numbers tell a hopeful story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Stanford, which has never lacked computer science students, majors nearly doubled after a new curriculum in 2008 let students choose a focus, like artificial intelligence. At the University of Washington, enrollment in the introductory computer science course is at a record high of 1,700. At Harvard, the size of the introductory computer science class has nearly quadrupled in five years. This year's course ended with an all-night ''hackathon'' with pizza, Chinese food and breakfast at IHOP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hook students, Yale computer science professors are offering freshman seminars with no prerequisites, like one on computer graphics, in which students learn the technical underpinnings of a Pixar movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Historically this department has been very theory-oriented, but in the last few years, we're broadening the curriculum,'' said Julie Dorsey, a professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also started a new major, computing and the arts, which combines computer science with art, theater or music to teach students how to scan and restore paintings or design theater sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professors stress that concentrating on the practical applications of computer science does not mean teaching vocational skills like programming languages, which change rapidly. Instead, it means guiding students to tackle real-world problems and learn skills and theorems along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once people are kind of subversively exposed to it, it's not someone telling you, 'You should program because you can be an engineer and do this in the future,' '' said Ms. Fong, the Yale student. ''It's, 'Solve this problem, build this thing and make this robot go from Point A to Point B,' and you gain the skill set associated with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With other students, she has already founded a Web start-up, the Closer Grocer, which delivers groceries to dorms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some question whether the surge in interest is a passing fad fueled by frenzy over iPhone apps and LinkedIn's soaring initial public offering, just as enrollment in computer science spiked during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But educators say this time is different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're seeing now is a better-motivated upsurge,'' said Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, ''students who understand that they really need to know this material.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the movie can't hurt, he said, because at least it has transformed the image of a programmer. Computer scientists are finally getting the treatment that doctors got with ''Grey's Anatomy'' and reporters with ''All the President's Men.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been saying for 15 years, 'If we could just get a show like the lawyer and doctor shows that make being a software person sexy,' '' Mr. Lazowska said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest sign that the economic recovery may have lost whatever modest oomph it had, more small businesses say that they are planning to shrink their payrolls than say they want to expand them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is according to a new report released Tuesday by the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group that regularly surveys its membership of small businesses across America.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federation's report for May showed the worst hiring prospects in eight months. The finding provides a glimpse into the pessimism of the nation's small firms as they put together their budgets for the coming season, and depicts a more gloomy outlook than other recent (if equally lackluster) economic indicators because this one is forward-looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While big companies are buoyed by record profits, many small businesses, which employ half of the country's private sector workers, are still struggling to break even. And if the nation's small companies plan to further delay hiring -- or, worse, return to laying off workers, as they now hint they might -- there is little hope that the nation's 14 million idle workers will find gainful employment soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Never in the 37-year history of our company have we seen anything at all like this,'' said Frank W. Goodnight, president of Diversified Graphics, a publishing company in Salisbury, N.C. He says there is ''no chance'' he will hire more workers in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're being squeezed on all sides,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each month, the National Federation of Independent Business surveys the owners of small businesses about how they are doing and where they think the economy is going. One question asks whether businesses plan to increase or decrease the number of employees in the next three months. Economists then calculate a net hiring figure by subtracting the percentage of companies that plan to downsize from the percentage that plans to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the share of companies that planned to shrink their work forces was one percentage point higher than the share of companies that planned to expand them, the first time since last September that this indicator was negative. And even though it was slightly negative, this index, a fairly reliable indicator of hiring decisions, has been trending downward all year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate has been stubbornly high in the last year, primarily because companies have stopped hiring, not laying off more workers. Although layoffs were at a record low in April, the latest monthly data available, Tuesday's survey suggests that workers may soon be challenged by both sides of the employment ledger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With wages relatively stagnant in recent months, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey found that workers' expectations for their families' income growth over the next year were at a record low. This is the first recovery in which, seven quarters in, there have been zero gains in aggregate wages and salaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stagnant wages, coupled with the recent stock market slide and further declines in housing prices, have left consumers feeling not well-off enough to significantly increase their spending, which would encourage hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One thing you've got to understand is that we do not hire workers for the sake of hiring workers. We hire them to do jobs,'' Mr. Goodnight said. ''If we don't have the work coming in, nothing will make me hire another person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the ''single most important problem'' facing their businesses, about one in four cited ''poor sales,'' according to the federation's survey. Uncertainty over regulations is also mentioned frequently. About a third of businesses blame either ''taxes'' or ''government requirements'' for their current troubles, leading some economists to attribute the recent slide in overall business optimism to Washington's protracted debates over tax policy, financial changes and health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, larger businesses, sitting on mountains of cash, have been weathering the weak recovery relatively well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook survey, also released on Tuesday, is a less closely watched report that relies on responses from the chief executives of larger companies. It found that the number of large companies expecting their American work forces to grow in the next six months far outnumbers those that anticipate shrinkage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we've had is a tale of two recoveries,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''Between large businesses and small businesses, it is literally the best of times and the worst of times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors have helped larger companies succeed, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said, ''Larger businesses have consistently had more going for them in this recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''They have better access to credit markets. They have greater ease in exporting abroad where some economies are growing faster than ours. All that shows up in their profits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one potential bright spot in the small-business survey involves industries that have had the smallest job growth but now seem willing to add jobs, according to William C. Dunkelberg, the chief economist for the federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include construction and nonprofessional services like restaurants, which was crippled by the housing bust. Manufacturing, which had been the engine of job growth for many months before scaling back in May, also showed promise.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy still struggling, it may seem like an impossible time to start a do-good social venture. It can be hard enough to operate any business profitably -- let alone one that also tries to improve the world. But some observers believe that the tough times may be increasing interest in social ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I get the sense that the recession actually has resulted in more people taking interest in investing in companies that are doing the right thing right from the start,'' said Wes Selke, investment manager at Good Capital, a social-impact venture capital firm in San Francisco. As one indicator, at least three social-impact funds have raised more than $100 million in the last couple of years: Ignia Fund, Leapfrog Investments and MicroVest.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marrying mission and money in one business can be tricky. This guide focuses on commercial, profit-making businesses and entrepreneurs who want to build self-sustaining social ventures, a term that encompasses nonprofit and profit-making companies as well as some new types of legal hybrids, like an L3C, which stands for low-profit limited liability company. These ventures are commonly thought of as enterprises that serve a so-called triple bottom line: people, planet and profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a social venture, the social mission is expected to be at least as important as the money-making mission. So, for example, the tobacco giant Philip Morris does not pass the test even though it donates generously to artistic and social causes. But a business that addresses a socioeconomic or environmental challenge as part of its DNA -- for instance by selling low-cost solar-powered lanterns to villages that lack electricity -- would be considered a social enterprise, according to Deb Nelson, executive director of Social Venture Network, an organization of some 500 chief executives, company founders, nonprofit leaders and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those looking to start such ventures, social entrepreneurs and investors offer the following pointers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S O.K. TO MAKE MONEY If you choose the profit-making model, stick with it -- without apology. A few years ago, Assaf Shafran founded a nonprofit in Israel that offered a smartphone-based dispatching system for first responders, like firefighters and emergency medical technicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his social venture, called IsraeLife, had an impossible time giving the system away to volunteer organizations, largely because the organizations were suspicious of giveaways -- they demanded exclusive rights or they got mired in red tape related to receiving gifts. Mr. Shafran decided he could do more good by selling the systems. In 2008 he and his team formed a profit-making division, called NowForce, which has expanded into the United States. The business has raised $2.5 million from private investors, and Mr. Shafran expects sales to surpass $3 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proudly embracing a profit-making model may require focusing on the balance sheet before unleashing the social mission. ''You can't pay employees a livable wage if you don't have money in the bank,'' said Lisa Lorimer, former chief executive of the Vermont Bread Company, which started making organic cookies in 1978.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VENTURE CAPITAL NOT THE SOLE OPTION Financing a social venture can be even more challenging than financing a traditional business. Some entrepreneurs prefer to self-finance with the help of bank loans. Others pursue venture capital, and they accept the loss of control that entails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vermont Bread began with a commitment to paying employees a ''livable wage'' -- three to four times more than the minimum wage most competitors offered. It also offered employees health insurance and bought ingredients from local and sustainable farms, which further squeezed margins, according to Ms. Lorimer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the company grew deliberately, mostly through bootstrapping and bank financing. At a time when many in the baking business said the company was unrealistic in trying to sell organic goods (with their brief shelf life) and to pay employees a premium, Vermont Bread was able to find a local bank that offered small loans so the fledgling business could buy equipment -- one pan, one truck, one pizza oven at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BE WARY OF GROWTH In 2005, James Gutierrez founded Progreso Financiero, a bank based in Mountain View, Calif. It offers small loans, averaging $1,000, to individuals and small businesses with little or no credit history, through staffed kiosks in Hispanic grocery stores and pharmacies in California and Texas. Borrowers often use the loans to buy a delivery truck or other equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gutierrez, 33, whose grandparents immigrated to the United States from Mexico, conceived Progreso Financiero as a ''social entrepreneuring'' research project when he was earning an M.B.A. at Stanford. He wanted to see if microlending, which was taking off in India, could help the millions of immigrants in the United States. He started in one Mexican supermarket in East Los Angeles. Before long he was operating staffed kiosks in 16 Sears and Kmart stores, which he figured would be magnets for many Latino families. ''We thought this was a great opportunity, a great way to grow fast,'' he said. It did not turn out that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sears and Kmart shut down Progreso's kiosks because their loan volume was thin. ''We found out that the grass-roots supermarkets are where people go three times a week, not the national chain stores,'' Mr. Gutierrez said, which ended up being a valuable lesson. The closings prompted Progreso to refocus on what Mr. Gutierrez called the basic building blocks: technology, automated credit scoring (yielding more loans per store per month), and the grass-roots supermarket channel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progreso's business model is based on charging an average percentage rate of 36 percent, roughly double the rate for bank credit cards but much less than the rates that many payday loan services charge. If borrowers pay back loans on time, Progreso grants them better terms on subsequent loans. With 480 employees, the company has secured more than $75 million in venture capital and another $75 million in debt financing, and it has issued more than 160,000 loans. Its loss rate is 5 to 10 percent, and Mr. Gutierrez said he expected the bank to become profitable next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIRE CREATIVELY Despite paying less than mainstream companies, social enterprises have the ability to hire talented people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mathieu Senard is chief executive of Alter Eco Americas, a San Francisco-based company that sells organic Fair Trade products, including dark chocolate bars, quinoa, rice and sugar to retailers. (Fair Trade purchasers offer above-market prices and promote sustainability in developing countries.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Senard and Edouard Rollet started the company in the United States in 2005, hoping to fight poverty through business. They buy goods at a premium from small farming cooperatives in developing countries. Mr. Senard expects sales to grow to $5 million this year from $3 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alter Eco broke into Whole Foods early on, but its products were not widely distributed nationwide. Mr. Senard feared that he could not afford the industry talent he needed to capture more shelf space. His big break came unexpectedly, four and a half years ago, when Kate Tierney, vice president for sales at a big natural foods distributor, agreed to serve on Alter Eco's board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tierney introduced Alter Eco to influential brokers and retailers. At one point she joined Alter Eco executives on a visit to a farming cooperative in Thailand. Not long after spending three days in a small village, Ms. Tierney told Mr. Senard that she planned to leave her job and come work for him. ''I was like a deer in the headlights,'' Mr. Senard said. ''I said, 'We can't afford you. We'd have to cut your salary in half.' '' Undeterred, Ms. Tierney joined Alter Eco and has helped double the company's sales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good morning, everybody. Have a seat, please. I just want to say a few words about the economy before I take your questions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a lot of folks out there who are still struggling with the effects of the recession. Many people are still looking for work or looking for a job that pays more. Families are wondering how they'd deal with a broken refrigerator or a busted transmission, or how they're going to finance their kids' college education, and they're also worrying about the possibility of layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggles of middle-class families were a big problem long before the recession hit in 2007. They weren't created overnight, and the truth is our economic challenges are not going to be solved overnight. But there are more steps that we can take right now that would help businesses create jobs here in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, our administration is trying to take those steps, so we're reviewing government regulations so that we can fix any rules in place that are an unnecessary burden on businesses. We're working with the private sector to get small businesses and start-ups the financing they need to grow and expand. And because of the partnership that we've launched with businesses and community colleges, 500,000 workers will be able to receive the right skills and training for manufacturing jobs in companies all across America -- jobs that companies are looking to fill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the steps that my administration can take on our own, there are also things that Congress could do right now that will help create good jobs. Right now, Congress can send me a bill that would make it easier for entrepreneurs to patent a new product or idea - because we can't give innovators in other countries a big leg up when it comes to opening new businesses and creating new jobs. That's something Congress could do right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, Congress could send me a bill that puts construction workers back on the job rebuilding roads and bridges - not by having government fund and pick every project, but by providing loans to private companies and states and local governments on the basis of merit and not politics. That's pending in Congress right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, Congress can advance a set of trade agreements that would allow American businesses to sell more of their goods and services to countries in Asia and South America - agreements that would support tens of thousands of American jobs while helping those adversely affected by trade. That's pending before Congress right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And right now, we could give middle-class families the security of knowing that the tax cut I signed in December will be there for one more year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there are a number of steps that my administration is taking, but there are also a number of steps that Congress could be taking right now on items that historically have had bipartisan support and that would help put more Americans back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these ideas have been tied up in Congress for some time. But, as I said, all of them enjoy bipartisan support, and all of them would help grow the economy. So I urge Congress to act on these ideas now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, one of the most important and urgent things we can do for the economy is something that both parties are working on right now - and that's reducing our nation's deficit. Over the last few weeks, the Vice President has been leading negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on this issue, and they've made some real progress in narrowing down the differences. As of last week, both parties had identified more than $1 trillion worth of spending cuts already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But everyone also knows that we'll need to do more to close the deficit. We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare. So we're going to need to look at the whole budget, as I said several months ago. And we've got to eliminate waste wherever we find it and make some tough decisions about worthy priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that means trimming the defense budget, while still meeting our security needs. It means we'll have to tackle entitlements, as long as we keep faith with seniors and children with disabilities by maintaining the fundamental security that Medicare and Medicaid provide. And, yes, we're going to have to tackle spending in the tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's been a lot of discussion about revenues and raising taxes in recent weeks, so I want to be clear about what we're proposing here. I spent the last two years cutting taxes for ordinary Americans, and I want to extend those middle-class tax cuts. The tax cuts I'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires; tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be nice if we could keep every tax break there is, but we've got to make some tough choices here if we want to reduce our deficit. And if we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, if we choose to keep a tax break for corporate jet owners, if we choose to keep tax breaks for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, then that means we've got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship. That means we've got to stop funding certain grants for medical research. That means that food safety may be compromised. That means that Medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden. Those are the choices we have to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the bottom line is this: Any agreement to reduce our deficit is going to require tough decisions and balanced solutions. And before we ask our seniors to pay more for health care, before we cut our children's education, before we sacrifice our commitment to the research and innovation that will help create more jobs in the economy, I think it's only fair to ask an oil company or a corporate jet owner that has done so well to give up a tax break that no other business enjoys. I don't think that's real radical. I think the majority of Americans agree with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the good news is, because of the work that's been done, I this we can actually bridge our differences. I think there is a conceptual framework that would allow us to make huge progress on our debt and deficit, and do so in a way that does not hurt our economy right here and right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it's not often that Washington sees both parties agree on the scale and the urgency of the challenge at hand. Nobody wants to put the creditworthiness of the United States in jeopardy. Nobody wants to see the United States default. So we've got to seize this moment, and we have to seize it soon. The Vice President and I will continue these negotiations with both leaders of both parties in Congress for as long as it takes, and we will reach a deal that will require our government to live within its means and give our businesses confidence and get this economy moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, with that, I will take your questions. I've got my list here. Starting off with Ben Feller, Associated Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. President. I'd like to follow up on the comments you just made as you try to reach a deal to raise the debt limit and cut the deficit. You keep saying that there needs to be this balanced approach of spending cuts and taxes. But Republicans say flatly, they won't --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: That they don't want a balanced approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: They don't want any tax increases, as they put it. And the House Speaker says not only that he doesn't support that, but that plan won't -- will not pass the House. So my question is will you insist, ultimately, that a deal has to include those tax increases that you just laid out? Is that an absolute red line for you? And if it is, can you explain to us how that can possibly get through the Congress?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Look, I think that what we've seen in negotiations here in Washington is a lot of people say a lot of things to satisfy their base or to get on cable news, but that hopefully, leaders at a certain point rise to the occasion and they do the right thing for the American people. And that's what I expect to happen this time. Call me naive, but my expectation is that leaders are going to lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I just want to be clear about what's at stake here. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer who's not an elected official, who's not a politician, says we can't reduce our deficit in the scale and scope that we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our constituencies and we may not like. And we've shown a willingness to do that for the greater good. To say, look, there are some things that are good programs that are nice to have; we can't afford them right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to have difficult conversations with the Pentagon saying, you know what, there's fat here; we're going to have to trim it out. And Bob Gates has already done a good job identifying $400 billion in cuts, but we're going to do more. And I promise you the preference of the Pentagon would not to cut any more, because they feel like they've already given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we're going to have to look at entitlements -- and that's always difficult politically. But I've been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the cost of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out-years, not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. But even if we're doing it in a smart way, that's still tough politics. But it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the question is, if everybody else is willing to take on their sacred cows and do tough things in order to achieve the goal of real deficit reduction, then I think it would be hard for the Republicans to stand there and say that the tax break for corporate jets is sufficiently important that we're not willing to come to the table and get a deal done. Or, we're so concerned about protecting oil and gas subsidies for oil companies that are making money hand over fist -- that's the reason we're not going to come to a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think that's a sustainable position. And the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Republicans who are not currently in office, like Alan Simpson who co-chaired my bipartisan commission, he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. Pete Domenici, Republican, co-chaired something with Alice Rivlin, the Democrat, says that's -- he doesn't think that's a sustainable position. You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling. It's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are a wealthy CEO or a health -- hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. You'll still be able to ride on your corporate jet; you're just going to have to pay a little more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if we -- I just want to emphasize what I said earlier. If we do not have revenues, that means there are a bunch of kids out there who are not getting college scholarships. If we do not have those revenues, then the kinds of cuts that would be required might compromise the National Weather Service. It means that we would not be funding critical medical research. It means that food inspection might be compromised. And I've said to some of the Republican leaders, you go talk to your constituents, the Republican constituents, and ask them are they willing to compromise their kids' safety so that some corporate jet owner continues to get a tax break. And I'm pretty sure what the answer would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we're going to keep on having these conversations. And my belief is, is that the Republican leadership in Congress will, hopefully sooner rather than later, come to the conclusion that they need to make the right decisions for the country; that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position -- they need to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: You think they'll ultimately give in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: My expectation is that they'll do the responsible thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chuck Todd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a lot of questions about the constitutionality -- constitutional interpretations of a few decisions you've made, so I'll just simply ask: Do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? Do you believe that the debt limit is constitutional, the idea that Congress can do this? And do you believe that marriage is a civil right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Well, that was a hodgepodge. (Laughter.) Chuck, we're going to assign you to the Supreme Court, man. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not a Supreme Court justice so I'm not going to -- putting my constitutional law professor hat on here. Let me focus on, initially, the issue of Libya. I want to talk about the substance of Libya because there's been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Let's talk about concretely what's happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muammar Qaddafi, who, prior to Osama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect -- provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interest and also because it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground. And our allies -- who, historically, we've complained aren't willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations -- have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, we've protected thousands of people in Libya; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; there's no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I said to the American people, here's our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the members of Congress over to talk about it. So a lot of this fuss is politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you look substantively at what we've done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down and the noose is tightening around him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers resolution, it came up after the Vietnam War in which we had half-a-million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent -- and Congress said, you know what, we don't want something like that happening again. So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers resolution? The answer is no. So I don't even have to get to the constitutional question. There may be a time in which there was a serious question as to whether or not the War Powers resolution -- act was constitutional. I don't have to get to the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have engaged in a limited operation to help a lot of people against one of the worst tyrants in the world -- somebody who nobody should want to defend -- and we should be sending a unified message to this guy that he should step down and give his people a fair chance to live their lives without fear. And this suddenly becomes the cause celebre for some folks in Congress? Come on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you had, what, a three-parter? (Laughter.) What are the other two?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: There is some question about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I'm just saying I don't have to reach it. That's a good legal answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Inaudible.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Let me start by saying that this administration, under my direction, has consistently said we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation. And we have done more in the two and a half years that I've been in here than the previous 43 Presidents to uphold that principle, whether it's ending ''don't ask, don't tell,'' making sure that gay and lesbian partners can visit each other in hospitals, making sure that federal benefits can be provided to same-sex couples. Across the board -- hate crimes -- we have made sure that that is a central principle of this administration, because I think it's a central principle of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, what we've also done is we've said that DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, is unconstitutional. And so we've said we cannot defend the federal government poking its nose into what states are doing and putting the thumb on the scale against same-sex couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I've seen happen over the last several years, and what happened in New York last week I think was a good thing, because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious; it was emotional; but, ultimately, they made a decision to recognize civil marriage. And I think that's exactly how things should work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so I think it is -- I think it is important for us to work through these issues -- because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different -- to work through them. In the meantime, we filed a -- we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say we think that any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny, and we don't think that DOMA is unconstitutional [sic]. And so I think the combination of what states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions that we're taking administratively, all are how the process should work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you at all uncomfortable that there could be different rules in different states, you know, and for somebody to make the argument that's what we saw during segregation --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Chuck, I think what you're seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays and lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our co-workers, and that they've got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out. It's not going to be perfectly smooth, and it turns out that the President -- I've discovered since I've been in this office -- can't dictate precisely how this process moves. But I think we're moving in a direction of greater equality and I think that's a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julianna.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. I only have a two-parter. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Are you concerned that the current debate over debt and deficits is preventing you from taking the kind of decisive and more balanced action needed to create jobs in this country, which is the number one concern for Americans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And also, one of the impediments to job growth that the business community repeatedly cites is the regulatory environment. So do you think that the NLRB complaint against <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, that this has created some of the -- is an example of the kinds of regulations that chill job growth, and also that you yourself have called ''just plain dumb''?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I think it's important to understand that deficit reduction, debt reduction, should be part of an overall package for job growth over the long term. It's not the only part of it, but it's an important part of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So as I mentioned at the top, I think it's important for us to look at rebuilding our transportation infrastructure in this country. That could put people back to work right now -- construction workers back to work right now. And it would get done work that America needs to get done. We used to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports. We don't anymore. And that's not good for our long-term competitiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we could put people to work right now and make sure that we're in a good position to win the future, as well. I think --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: -- spending and (inaudible.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I'm going to get to it. I think that it's important for us to look at the tax code and figure out, are there ways that we can simplify it and also build on the work that we've already done, for example, saying to small businesses or start-up businesses, you don't have to pay capital gains when you're in start-up mode, because we want you to get out there and start a business. That's important. Making sure that SBA is helping to get financing to small businesses, that's important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there are a whole range of things that we can be doing. I think these trade deals will be important -- because right now South Korea, frankly, has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So let's rebalance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there are a range of things that we could be doing right now. Deficit and debt reduction should be seen as part of that overall process, because I think if businesses feel confident that we've got our act together here in Washington, that not only is the government not going to default but we're also preparing for a future in which the population is getting older and we're going to have more expenses on the Medicare side and Social Security, that businesses will feel more confident about investing here in the United States of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I don't think they're contradictory. And as I've said before, certainly in my job, but I think Congress, as well, they've got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. So we can focus on jobs at the same time as we're focusing on debt and deficit reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, one of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there, in fact, a bunch of -- a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should. Keep in mind that the business community is always complaining about regulations. When unemployment is at 3 percent and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've got an obligation to make sure that we're upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. If you're flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel, right? So there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way, no administration has done this before -- is I've said to each agency, don't just look at current regulations -- or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing, let's go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books, and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them. And we are in the process of doing that, and we've already identified changes that could potentially save billions of dollars for companies over the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you asked specifically about one decision that was made by the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, and this relates to <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. Essentially, the NLRB made a finding that <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> had not followed the law in making a decision to move a plant. And it's an independent agency. It's going before a judge. So I don't want to get into the details of the case. I don't know all the facts. That's going to be up to a judge to decide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I do know is this -- that as a general proposition, companies need to have the freedom to relocate. They have to follow the law, but that's part of our system. And if they're choosing to relocate here in the United States, that's a good thing. And what it doesn't make -- what I think defies common sense would be a notion that we would be shutting down a plant or laying off workers because labor and management can't come to a sensible agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So my hope is, is that even as this thing is working its way through, everybody steps back for a second and says, look, if jobs are being created here in the United States, let's make sure that we're encouraging that. And we can't afford to have labor and management fighting all the time, at a time when we're competing against Germany and China and other countries that want to sell goods all around the world. And obviously, the airplane industry is an area where we still have a huge advantage, and I want to make sure that we keep it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Lander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday, Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasn't a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesn't want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear procedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, my top priority in each and every one of these situations is to make sure that we're apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way that's consistent with due process of law; and that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way that's consistent with rule of law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be sometimes where a military commission may be appropriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies -- Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations -- to think through on a case-by-case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not going to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And that's always going to be the priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I think it's important to understand, and the American people need to be assured that anytime we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that we're able to obtain actionable intelligence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that you're suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them. Okay?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Emanuel, FOX.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Last week when you gave your Afghanistan drawdown speech, the word ''victory,'' in terms of the overall war in Afghanistan, was not in your speech. So I'm wondering, sir, if you can define for the 100,000 troops you have in harm's way in Afghanistan ''victory'' in the war, and for their families, as well, sir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Well, I didn't use ''victory'' in my West Point speech, either. What I said was we can be successful in our mission, which is narrowly drawn, and that is to make sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the United States of America or our allies or our interests overseas, and to make sure that we have an Afghan government that -- and an Afghan people that can provide for their own security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are being successful in those missions. And the reason that we're in a position to draw down 10,000 troops this year and a total of 33,000 troops by the end of next summer is precisely because of the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform. What they've been able to do is to severely cripple al Qaeda's capacities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously bin Laden got the most attention, but even before the bin Laden operation we had decimated the middle ranks and some of the upper ranks of al Qaeda. They're having a great deal of difficulty operating, a great deal of difficulty communicating and financing themselves, and we are going to keep the pressure on. And in part that's because of the extraordinary sacrifices that have been made by our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we've also been able to do is to ramp up the training of Afghan forces. So we've got an additional 100,000 Afghan troops, both Army and police, that have been trained as a consequence of this surge. And that is going to give the Afghans more capacity to defend themselves because it is in our national interest to make sure that you did not have a collapse of Afghanistan in which extremist elements could flood the zone once again, and over time al Qaeda might be in a position to rebuild itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what I laid out was a plan in which we are going to be drawing down our troops from Afghanistan after 10 very long years and an enormous sacrifice by our troops. But we will draw them in a -- draw them down in a responsible way that will allow Afghanistan to defend itself and will give us the operational capacity to continue to put pressure on al Qaeda until that network is entirely defeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION -- the attack on the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, sir? And does that concern you that Afghan forces may not be able to step up if these guys are able to attack a high-profile target in the nation's capital?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Well, keep in mind the drawdown hasn't begun. So we understood that Afghanistan is a dangerous place, that the Taliban is still active, and that there are still going to be events like this on occasion. The question is, in terms of overall trend, is Afghanistan capacity increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kabul, for example, which contains a huge proportion of the Afghan population as a whole, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time. And they've done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean that there are not going to be events like this potentially taking place, and that will probably go on for some time. Our work is not done. But as I said in my speech, the tide of war is receding. We have shifted to a transition phase. And much like we've seen in Iraq, where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder of our troops will be coming out by the end of this year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and to tamp down violence there -- we think a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack. These are still countries that are digging themselves out of a lot of war, a lot of conflict. They're dangerous places. And so they're not going to be perfectly safe, even if we were there. But we can improve the chances for the Afghan people to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Sciutto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You're aware that Senators Kerry and McCain have a proposal on the Senate floor to give you the leeway to continue operations in Libya for a further year. You've just said that this, from the beginning, has been an operation limited in time and scope. Initially you said days, not weeks. Are you prepared, are the American people prepared for this operation, with American support, to continue for a further year? And is there any other definition of success than Qaddafi being removed from power?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Jim, just a slight correction. What I told the American people was that the initial phase where Americans were in the lead would take days, perhaps weeks. And that's exactly what happened, right? I mean, after -- around two weeks, a little less than two weeks, we had transitioned where NATO had taken full control of the operation. So promise made, promise kept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, I think when you have the former Republican nominee for President, John McCain, and the former nominee for President on the Democratic side, John Kerry, coming together to support what we're doing in Libya, that should tell the American people that this is important. And I very much appreciate their efforts in that regard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, when it comes to our definitions of success, the U.N. mandate has said that we are there to make sure that you do not see a massacre directed against Libyan civilians by the Libyan regime. The Libyan regime's capacity has been greatly reduced as a consequence of our operation. That's already been successful. What we've seen both in the East and in the West is that opposition forces have been able to mobilize themselves and start getting organized, and people are starting to see the possibility of a more peaceful future on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is also true is, as long as Qaddafi is still presenting himself as the head of the Libyan government, and as long as he still controls large numbers of troops, the Libyan people are going to be in danger of counter-offensives and of retribution. So there is no doubt that Qaddafi stepping down from power is -- from the international community's perspective -- going to be the primary way that we can assure that the overall mission of Libya's people being protected is accomplished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I just want to point out -- I know it's something you know -- the International Criminal Court identified Qaddafi as having violated international law, having committed war crimes. What we've seen is reports of troops engaging in horrible acts, including potentially using rape as a weapon of war. And so when you have somebody like that in charge of large numbers of troops, I think it would be hard for us to feel confident that the Libyan people are going to be protected unless he steps down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, what that means, whether there's the possibility of Libyans arriving at some sort of political settlement, that I think is something that ultimately the Libyan people are going to have to make a decision about -- because the international community is there in service of that broader goal, of a peaceful Libya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Would you accept a political settlement with him involved as success from the American perspective?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I would accept him stepping down so that he is not directing armed forces against the Libyan people. He needs to step down. He needs to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Meckler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. In these debt talks, would you accept -- would you like to see some sort of tax breaks aimed at stimulating the economy, even though that would of course add to the deficit itself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I'd also like to follow up on one of your earlier answers about same-sex marriage. You said that it's a positive step that so many states, including New York, are moving towards that. Does that mean that you personally now do support same-sex marriage, putting aside what individual states decide? Is that your personal view?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I'm not going to make news on that today. (Laughter.) Good try, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with respect to the deficit and debt talks and where we need to go, I do think it's important, since we're looking at how do we reduce the debt and deficit both in a 10-year window as well as beyond a 10-year window, to understand that one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit reduction is to grow the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so if there are steps that in the short term may reduce the amount of cash in the treasury but in the long term mean that we're growing at 3.5 percent instead of 2.5 percent, then those ideas are worth exploring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously that was what we did in December during the lame duck session, when Democrats and Republicans came together and we said, you know what, a payroll tax cut makes sense in order to boost the economy; unemployment insurance makes sense in order to boost the economy. All that stuff puts money in people's pockets at a time when they're still struggling to dig themselves out of this recession. And so the American people have an extra thousand dollars, on average, in their pockets because of the tax cuts that we initiated. And that has helped cushion some of the tough stuff that happened in the first six months of this year, including the effects on oil prices as a consequence of what happened in the Middle East as well as what happened in Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that it makes perfect sense for us to take a look at can we extend the payroll tax, for example, an additional year, and other tax breaks for business investment that could make a big difference in terms of creating more jobs right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we need to do is to restore business confidence and the confidence of the American people that we're on track -- that we're not going to get there right away, that this is a tough slog, but that we still are moving forward. And I think that it makes sense, as we're looking at an overall package, to see, are there some things that we can do to sustain the recovery, so long as the overall package achieves our goals -- the goals that I set out, which is $4 trillion within a 10-to 12-year window, and making sure that we're bending the costs of things like health care over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: I'm sorry, I know you don't want to say anything further on the same-sex marriage issue, but what you said before really led me to believe that that's what is in your personal mind. And I'm wondering what's the distinction you're drawing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Laura, I think this has been asked and answered. I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I give you a different one, all right? And that won't be today. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: That's going to be -- (inaudible.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Yes, exactly. I thought you'd like that one. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antonieta Cadiz? There you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. President. First, if you receive a mandatory E-verify bill only without legalization, are you planning to veto that deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And second, on Fast and Furious, members of Congress and the government of Mexico are still waiting for answers. Are you planning to replace ATF leadership? And when can we expect the results of the current investigation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: On the second question, as you know, my attorney general has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. The investigation is still pending. I'm not going to comment on a current investigation. I've made very clear my views that that would not be an appropriate step by the ATF, and we got to find out how that happened. As soon as the investigation is completed, I think appropriate actions will be taken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to E-verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. I've said it before. I will say it again. I will say it next week. And I'll say it six months from now. We've got to have a system that makes sure that we uphold our tradition as a nation of laws and that we also uphold our tradition as a nation of immigrants. And that means tough border security, going after employers that are illegally hiring and exploiting workers, making sure that we also have a pathway for legal status for those who are living in the shadows right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may not be able to get everything that I would like to see in a package, but we have to have a balanced package. E-verify can be an important enforcement tool if it's not riddled with errors, if U.S. citizens are protected -- because what I don't want is a situation in which employers are forced to set up a system that they can't be certain works. And we don't want to expose employers to the risk where they end up rejecting a qualified candidate for a job because the list says that that person is an illegal immigrant, and it turns out that the person isn't an illegal immigrant. That wouldn't be fair for the employee and would probably get the employer in trouble as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I think the goal right now is to let's continue to see if we can perfect the E-verify system. Let's make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of scenarios that I talked about. But let's also not lose sight of some of the other components to immigration reform. For example, making sure that DREAM Act kids -- kids who have grown up here in the United States, think of themselves as Americans, who are not legal through no fault of their own, and who are ready to invest and give back to our country and go to school and fight in our military and start businesses here -- let's make sure that those kids can stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to have a more balanced approach than just a verification system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: (Inaudible.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I don't have an answer as to whether the investigation is completed yet, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on the investigation if I don't -- if it's not yet completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Yellin. Congratulations, your first question here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: No pressure. You're going to do great. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you. Your administration has laid out four different dates by which you've said that the debt ceiling must be raised or the U.S. would face potential dire consequences. Three of those dates have come and gone and we haven't faced financial calamity. Some of your critics have argued that these are then scare tactics to force a deal. So why should the American people believe that the August 2nd deadline is the final deadline by which a deal must be raised? And would you also spell out for us what you believe will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised by that date?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: Jessica, let's be clear. We haven't given out four different dates. We have given out dates that are markers for us getting into trouble. It's the equivalent of you're driving down the street and the yellow light starts flashing. The yellow light is flashing. Now, it hasn't been a red light yet. So what Tim Geithner has said is, technically speaking, we're in a position now where we're having to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that our bills are paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By August 2nd, we run out of tools to make sure that all our bills are paid. So that is a hard deadline. And I want everybody to understand that this is a jobs issue. This is not an abstraction. If the United States government, for the first time, cannot pay its bills, if it defaults, then the consequences for the U.S. economy will be significant and unpredictable. And that is not a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We don't know how capital markets will react. But if capital markets suddenly decide, you know what, the U.S. government doesn't pay its bills, so we're going to start pulling our money out, and the U.S. Treasury has to start to raise interest rates in order to attract more money to pay off our bills, that means higher interest rates for businesses; that means higher interest rates for consumers. So all the headwinds that we're already experiencing in terms of the recovery will get worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not my opinion. I think that's a consensus opinion. And that means that job growth will be further stymied, it will be further hampered, as a consequence of that decision. So that's point number one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Point number two, I want to address what I've been hearing from some quarters, which is, well, maybe this debt limit thing is not really that serious; we can just pay interest on the debt. This idea has been floating around in some Republican circles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the equivalent of me saying, you know what, I will choose to pay my mortgage, but I'm not going to pay my car note. Or I'm going to pay my car note but I'm not going to pay my student loan. Now, a lot of people in really tough situations are having to make those tough decisions. But for the U.S. government to start picking and choosing like that is not going to inspire a lot of confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, which bills are we going to decide to pay? These guys have said, well, maybe we just pay the interest on -- for bondholders. So are we really going to start paying interest to Chinese who hold treasuries and we're not going to pay folks their Social Security checks? Or we're not going to pay to veterans for their disability checks? I mean, which bills, which obligations, are we going to say we don't have to pay?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last point I want to make about this. These are bills that Congress ran up. The money has been spent. The obligations have been made. So this isn't a situation -- I think the American people have to understand this -- this is not a situation where Congress is going to say, okay, we won't -- we won't buy this car or we won't take this vacation. They took the vacation. They bought the car. And now they're saying maybe we don't have to pay, or we don't have to pay as fast as we said we were going to, or -- that's not how responsible families act. And we're the greatest nation on Earth, and we can't act that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this is urgent and it needs to get settled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: So is August 2nd a yellow light or a red light?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I think people should think of -- look, I'm the President of the United States and I want to make sure that I am not engaging in scare tactics. And I've tried to be responsible and somewhat restrained so that folks don't get spooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August 2nd is a very important date. And there's no reason why we can't get this done now. We know what the options are out there. This is not a technical problem any longer. This is a matter of Congress going ahead and biting the bullet and making some tough decisions. Because we know what the decisions are. We've identified what spending cuts are possible. We've identified what defense cuts are possible. We've identified what health care cuts are possible. We've identified what loopholes in the tax code can be closed that would also raise revenue. We've identified what the options are. And the question now is are we going to step up and get this done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, you know, Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time. Malia is 13, Sasha is 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION Impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: It is impressive. They don't wait until the night before. They're not pulling all-nighters. (Laughter.) They're 13 and 10. Congress can do the same thing. If you know you've got to do something, just do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I've got to say, I'm very amused when I start hearing comments about, well, the President needs to show more leadership on this. Let me tell you something. Right after we finished dealing with the government shutdown, averting a government shutdown, I called the leaders here together. I said we've got to get done -- get this done. I put Vice President Biden in charge of a process -- that, by the way, has made real progress -- but these guys have met, worked through all of these issues. I met with every single caucus for an hour to an hour and a half each -- Republican senators, Democratic senators; Republican House, Democratic House. I've met with the leaders multiple times. At a certain point, they need to do their job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, this thing, which is just not on the level, where we have meetings and discussions, and we're working through process, and when they decide they're not happy with the fact that at some point you've got to make a choice, they just all step back and say, well, you know, the President needs to get this done -- they need to do their job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now is the time to go ahead and make the tough choices. That's why they're called leaders. And I've already shown that I'm willing to make some decisions that are very tough and will give my base of voters further reason to give me a hard time. But it's got to be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so there's no point in procrastinating. There's no point in putting it off. We've got to get this done. And if by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I think members of Congress need to understand we are going to start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're in one week, they're out one week. And then they're saying, Obama has got to step in. You need to be here. I've been here. I've been doing Afghanistan and bin Laden and the Greek crisis. You stay here. Let's get it done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All right. I think you know my feelings about that. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caren Bohan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You talked about the payroll tax holiday and possibly extending that. Are you worried, though, that by adding a discussion of short-term measures on the economy into these discussions about long-term deficit reductions that that may complicate the conversation and make it harder to pass a debt limit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OBAMA: I will -- let me put it this way. If we've got a good deal on debt and deficit reduction that focuses not just on the 10-year window but also the long term, we will get it done. And then we can argue about some other things -- because I think that's very important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will say that precisely because tough votes in Congress are often avoided, that it may make sense to also deal with something like a payroll tax cut at the same time -- because it does have budget implications and the American people need to know that we're focused on jobs and not just on deficit reduction, even though, as I said, deficit reduction helps to serve the job agenda. I think they want to have some confidence that we've got a plan that's helping right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I don't think it should be a complicating factor -- because if Mitch McConnell and John Boehner came to me and said, all right, we're ready to make a deal, here's a balanced approach to debt and deficit reduction, but we want to argue about payroll tax cuts later, they're not set to expire until the end of this year -- if that was a situation that they presented, then I think we would have a serious conversation about that. I would not discount that completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I do think that the steps that I talked about to deal with job growth and economic growth right now are vitally important to deficit reduction. Just as deficit reduction is important to grow the economy and to create jobs -- well, creating jobs and growing the economy also helps reduce the deficit. If we just increased the growth rate by one percentage point, that would drastically bring down the long-term projections of the deficit, because people are paying more into the coffers and fewer people are drawing unemployment insurance. It makes a huge difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this may be sort of a good place to wrap up. You know, every day I get letters from folks all around the country who show incredible resilience, incredible determination, but they are having a very, very tough time. They're losing their homes. Some have lost their businesses. Some have lost work and have not been able to find jobs for months, maybe a year, maybe a year and a half. And they feel some desperation. And some folks who are working just are having a tough time paying the bills because they haven't seen their wages or incomes go up in 10 years, and the costs of everything else have gone up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And every day that weighs on me. Every minute of every day that weighs on me. Because I ran for President precisely to make sure that we righted this ship and we start once again creating a situation where middle-class families and people who aspire to be in the middle class, if they're working hard, then they're living a better life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, these structural changes in our economy that have been going on for a decade -- in some cases, longer -- they're not going to be solved overnight. But we know what to do. We know that if we are educating our kids well, then they're going to be more competitive. We know that if we are investing in things like infrastructure, it pays off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was in <span class="companylink">Alcoa</span>, in Iowa, one of our most successful companies. They took a big hit during the recession, but they still invested $90 million in new equipment in a plant that makes airplane wings and parts for automobiles. And they've bounced back. They've hired back all their people and are increasing market share because they made those investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, just like a company like <span class="companylink">Alcoa</span>, America has got to make some investments. We know that we've got to get control of our deficit. There are some things that aren't going to solve all our problems but can make progress right now. And the question is whether or not Democrats and Republicans are willing to put aside the expedience of short-term politics in order to get it done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And these folks are counting on us. They desperately want to believe that their leadership is thinking about them and not playing games. And I think that if all the leadership here in Washington has the faces and the stories of those families in mind, then we will solve this debt limit issue; we will put in place steps like a payroll tax cut and infrastructure development; we'll continue to fund education; we'll hold true to our commitment to our seniors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are solvable problems, but it does require us just getting out of the short-term and, frankly, selfish approach that sometimes politics breeds. We've got to think a bit long term.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE smell of oil paint in the Bridgehampton air will barely have dissipated from one art fair before another begins this week. The inaugural artMRKT Hamptons, to be held from Thursday to July 17 on the grounds of the Bridgehampton Historical Society, comes hard on the heels of ArtHamptons, less than a mile away at Sayre Park, which closes Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This little burst of activity may not be entirely coincidental. One of the two producers of artMRKT Hamptons, which will showcase about 35 galleries and focus on contemporary work, is Max Fishko, 28, who used to be the director of the Hamptons Expo Group, which runs the other fair. He left last year to start his own company, artMRKT Productions, with his business partner, Jeffrey Wainhause. The first artMRKT was held in May in San Francisco, where it ran simultaneously with the San Francisco Fine Art Fair, also presented by Mr. Fishko's former employer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fishko downplayed any rivalry in a recent telephone interview, saying that his company and the Hamptons Expo Group are ''in very different businesses'' and are ''offering very different experiences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One main difference, Mr. Fishko said, is size: artMRKT is a smaller show that he described as a ''boutique, edited experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fishko is the grandson of Bella Fishko, who started Forum Gallery in New York in 1961, and his parents run Forum today. ''I grew up going to openings and knocking around the gallery scene with my family and going to art fairs,'' Mr. Fishko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the galleries he has gathered are Foley Gallery, Forum and Lennon, Weinberg, all of New York; Boltax Gallery of Shelter Island; Fredric Snitzer Gallery of Miami; and Aureus Contemporary of Providence, R.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charity forms a component of the fair. A preview party on Thursday will benefit Southampton Hospital, and MRKTworks, an auction running both online and on site, will raise money for three Hamptons nonprofit organizations: the Nature Conservancy, Children's Museum of the East End and the Bay Street Theater.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the frenzied final days of New York's legislative session, an important health care measure fell by the wayside. The Republican-led State Senate failed to pass a bill to establish a health insurance exchange where individuals and small businesses would be able to buy coverage starting in 2014. An identical bill had already passed the Democratic-led Assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the state fails to enact the authorizing legislation soon, it will find it extremely hard to qualify for a big federal grant to underwrite the entire cost of setting up the exchange and operating it through 2014. Tens of millions of dollars in federal support could be forfeited.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate leadership pulled the bill before the vote because a few Republicans absurdly equated a vote for a health exchange with a vote to support the federal health care reforms. They refused to ''give'' Democrats both gay marriage and ''Obamacare'' on the same day. They need to realize that if the state does not set up a health exchange, the federal government will step in and do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many senators said they were uncertain about the bill's implications and were unsatisfied with answers they were getting from the bill's sponsors. The bill pending in the Senate would create the exchange as a ''public benefit corporation,'' run by an independent board appointed by the governor and legislative leaders and authorized to develop regulations to comply with federal health reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill also provides that if any provision of the federal reforms is repealed or found unconstitutional, the state's exchange law becomes invalid. No matter what the Senate does, health care reform is going to happen. It makes sense for New York to set up its own exchange -- crafted with an eye toward the state's particular needs -- and have Washington foot most of the bill. The senators should return later this year and pass this legislation in the form it was approved by the Assembly.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the unemployment rate last month to 9.2 percent has Democrats and Republicans reliably falling back on their respective cure-alls. It is evidence for liberals that we need more stimulus and for conservatives that we need more tax cuts to increase demand. I am sure there is truth in both, but I do not believe they are the whole story. I think something else, something new -- something that will require our kids not so much to find their next job as to invent their next job -- is also influencing today's job market more than people realize.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at the news these days from the most dynamic sector of the U.S. economy -- Silicon Valley. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is now valued near $100 billion, Twitter at $8 billion, Groupon at $30 billion, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> at $20 billion and LinkedIn at $8 billion. These are the fastest-growing Internet/social networking companies in the world, and here's what's scary: You could easily fit all their employees together into the 20,000 seats in Madison Square Garden, and still have room for grandma. They just don't employ a lot of people, relative to their valuations, and while they're all hiring today, they are largely looking for talented engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, what is most striking when you talk to employers today is how many of them have used the pressure of the recession to become even more productive by deploying more automation technologies, software, outsourcing, robotics -- anything they can use to make better products with reduced head count and health care and pension liabilities. That is not going to change. And while many of them are hiring, they are increasingly picky. They are all looking for the same kind of people -- people who not only have the critical thinking skills to do the value-adding jobs that technology can't, but also people who can invent, adapt and reinvent their jobs every day, in a market that changes faster than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's college grads need to be aware that the rising trend in Silicon Valley is to evaluate employees every quarter, not annually. Because the merger of globalization and the I.T. revolution means new products are being phased in and out so fast that companies cannot afford to wait until the end of the year to figure out whether a team leader is doing a good job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever you may be thinking when you apply for a job today, you can be sure the employer is asking this: Can this person add value every hour, every day -- more than a worker in India, a robot or a computer? Can he or she help my company adapt by not only doing the job today but also reinventing the job for tomorrow? And can he or she adapt with all the change, so my company can adapt and export more into the fastest-growing global markets? In today's hyperconnected world, more and more companies cannot and will not hire people who don't fulfill those criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you would never know that from listening to the debate in Washington, where some Democrats still tend to talk about job creation as if it's the 1960s and some Republicans as if it's the 1980s. But this is not your parents' job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is precisely why LinkedIn's founder, Reid Garrett Hoffman, one of the premier starter-uppers in Silicon Valley -- besides co-founding LinkedIn, he is on the board of <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, was an early investor in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and sits on the board of Mozilla -- has a book coming out after New Year called ''The Start-Up of You,'' co-authored with Ben Casnocha. Its subtitle could easily be: ''Hey, recent graduates! Hey, 35-year-old midcareer professional! Here's how you build your career today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoffman argues that professionals need an entirely new mind-set and skill set to compete. ''The old paradigm of climb up a stable career ladder is dead and gone,'' he said to me. ''No career is a sure thing anymore. The uncertain, rapidly changing conditions in which entrepreneurs start companies is what it's now like for all of us fashioning a career. Therefore you should approach career strategy the same way an entrepreneur approaches starting a business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, Hoffman says, that means ditching a grand life plan. Entrepreneurs don't write a 100-page business plan and execute it one time; they're always experimenting and adapting based on what they learn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also means using your network to pull in information and intelligence about where the growth opportunities are -- and then investing in yourself to build skills that will allow you to take advantage of those opportunities. Hoffman adds: ''You can't just say, 'I have a college degree, I have a right to a job, now someone else should figure out how to hire and train me.' '' You have to know which industries are working and what is happening inside them and then ''find a way to add value in a way no one else can. For entrepreneurs it's differentiate or die -- that now goes for all of us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, you have to strengthen the muscles of resilience. ''You may have seen the news that [the] online radio service Pandora went public the other week,'' Hoffman said. ''What's lesser known is that in the early days [the founder] pitched his idea more than 300 times to V.C.'s with no luck.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another young photographer is now accusing him of relying too heavily on her work for his inspiration, Artnet reports. Janine Gordon, who is known as JahJah and is also a musician and multimedia artist, has filed suit against Mr. McGinley in federal court in Manhattan, saying that at least 150 of his photographs are ''substantially based'' on her work and are violations of her copyright protections.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RONA ECONOMOU was a lawyer at a large Manhattan law firm, making a comfortable salary and enjoying nights on the town when she was laid off in 2009, another victim of the recession. At first, she cried. ''Then it hit me,'' said Ms. Economou, now 33. ''This is my one chance'' to pursue a dream.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months later, feeling hopeful, she opened Boubouki, a tiny Greek food stall at the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side, where she bakes spinach pies and baklava every morning. This was supposed to be her Plan B: her chance to indulge a passion, lead a healthier life and downshift professionally -- at least by a gear. Instead, Ms. Economou finds herself in overdrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six days a week, she wakes up at 5:30 a.m. (''before most lawyers'') to start baking. Instead of pushing paper, she hoists 20-pound bags of flour, gets burned and occasionally slices open a finger. On Mondays, when the shop is closed, she does bookkeeping and other administrative tasks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much for a healthier life. ''The second I feel a cold coming on, I'm taking Cold-Eeze, eating raw garlic,'' she said. ''I can't afford to shut the shop down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plan B, it turns out, is a lot harder than it seems. But that hasn't stopped cubicle captives from fantasizing. In recent years, a wave of white-collar professionals has seized on a moribund job market, a swelling enthusiasm for all things artisanal and the growing sense that work should have meaning to cut ties with the corporate grind and chase second careers as chocolatiers, bed-and-breakfast proprietors and organic farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, since the dawn of the Great Recession, more Americans have started businesses (565,000 of them a month in 2010) than at any period in the last decade and a half, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which tracks statistics on entrepreneurship in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lures are obvious: freedom, fulfillment. The highs can be high. But career switchers have found that going solo comes with its own pitfalls: a steep learning curve, no security, physical exhaustion and emotional meltdowns. The dream job is a ''job'' as much as it is a ''dream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The decision to become an entrepreneur should not be made lightly,'' said Paul Bernard, an executive coach in New York who has advised professionals on starting small businesses. The press, he said, has made heroes out of former investment bankers and lawyers who transformed themselves into successful dog-jewelry designers and cupcake kings. ''But the reality is that, even during boom times, most new businesses fail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are surprised to find the hours and work grueling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was a rude awakening for Mary Lee Herrington, a 32-year-old St. Louis native who worked at a white-shoe law firm in London. Two years ago she ditched her job as a fourth-year associate, making $250,000 and working 60-hour weeks, to pursue a new life as a wedding planner. Her experience? She enjoyed organizing galas as a law student at the University of Pennsylvania. ''It was really creative, it was fun, I loved all the details: the party favors, the programs,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But soon after starting her one-woman business, Forever &amp; Ever Events, she quickly found it wasn't a 9-to-5 gig. Working out of the Primrose Hill apartment she shared with her husband, she often found herself glued to the computer past midnight, doing spreadsheet analyses of her new business, or writing copy for her Web site. Whenever a wedding date approached, she found herself pulling 17-hour days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For her first client, a work colleague of a friend, she was so eager to prove herself that she charged $2,000 for a job that took five months. For another wedding, ''the clients were very demanding of my time, so much so that when I broke down the fee by the number of hours, I was making close to $:1 an hour,'' Ms. Herrington said. (By comparison, her rate as a lawyer was $450 an hour.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arithmetic doesn't account for the loss of free time. When you're the boss, the workday never really ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charan Sachar, 37, a former software engineer who lives near Seattle, used to spend his downtime perusing Etsy, the D.I.Y. crafts site. He daydreamed of an unfettered life at his kiln, creating Bollywood-inspired teapots and butter dishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, after 12 years in software, he quit to devote himself full time to his online store, Creative With Clay, which sells stoneware he designs and makes. (Last May, he told his story on Etsy's ''Quit Your Day Job'' blog.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, instead of spending his free time absorbed in visions of clay, he spends as much as 70 percent of his day on administration. He is not only his own boss, he is his own accountant, sales director, marketing manager and shipping clerk. That leaves little time to enjoy the hobby he loves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some days that I don't make anything in my studio, mostly because I am doing everything else,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former white-collar workers are also surprised by the demands of manual labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Jennifer Phelan, 27, left a marketing job at a large law firm to become a private Pilates instructor in Boston. She had envisioned a life of ''workouts, getting lots of sleep and blogging every day about health and fitness,'' she said. Instead, her classes start as early as 6 a.m. and she feels wiped out by day's end, which can be 14 hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I preach to my students to make time for themselves, to treat their bodies as vital instruments,'' Ms. Phelan said. ''Now, I'm lucky if I get that in a few times a month.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Kang, 26, a former commercial bank analyst in Los Angeles, has it worse. Last year, he quit his prestigious job to open Scoops Westside, an ice cream shop in Culver City. ''I feel like a janitor sometimes,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least janitors have a steady paycheck. Plan B might entail more freedom, but that often comes at the expense of financial security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Anne McInnis, 52, was laid off as a textiles design director at <span class="companylink">Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia</span>, she and her live-in partner, David Zadeh, opened an antiques and jewelry shop in Hudson, N.Y., called 12: Modern Antiquities. As a retailer with no retail experience, she had trouble getting used to the uncertainty. On any given day, there's no telling if 5 people or 50 will come through the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the shop, you do all your prep work, buying, merchandising and designing,'' she said. ''And it is a continuous process. And then you wait. And wait.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when business is steady, the sacrifices are never far from mind. Is being your own boss worth the trade-off in medical benefits, gas allowances and paid vacations? AnnaBelle LaRoque, 28, a former pharmaceutical representative in Columbia, S.C., still wonders. ''There have been many times when I have had oatmeal for dinner and Grey Goose for dessert, contemplating these questions,'' said Ms. LaRoque, who gave up those perks to start a dress line, LaRoque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, keeping a dream job alive also means getting a second job. Before Ms. Herrington, the wedding planner, landed on her feet, she took a part-time job at the London Business School, coordinating a counseling program, that paid $18 an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a drag, but it was necessary because I had bills to pay and student loan payments every month,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some career switchers, the toughest challenges aren't the financial or physical hazards, but the emotional ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk of isolation is ever-present without co-workers to lean on. There are no bosses to take the heat in moments of crisis, no team to share the triumphs -- or the blame when things go wrong. And as Beth Conroy found out, rejection feels more personal when it's a one-person shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last April Ms. Conroy, 35, quit public relations to become a licensed acupuncturist, opening a practice in Manhattan. She worries whenever a client doesn't return. Was the ailment cured? Or ''is it something I've done,'' she said. ''There's a lot of uncertainty if I let it become a reflection of me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-esteem comes up in another way. Leaving behind white-collar security can mean losing your identity as a breadwinner -- a ''loss of control,'' as Jackie Alpers of Tucson put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being laid off from a luxury spa as its media relations coordinator, Ms. Alpers, 43, started a career as a food photographer for cookbooks and magazines. She loves the creativity, but dreads not knowing about the next gig and possibly failing to keep up her ''end of the bargain'' in maintaining a household with her husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Women have worked hard for equality,'' Ms. Alpers added. ''I sometimes felt that I was taking a step backwards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some, the unexpected pitfalls can be so treacherous that they no longer consider Plan B a dream job, but a nightmare. That was the unfortunate lesson for Anne-Laure Vibert, 31, who gave up a marketing job in New York, planning glamorous parties for Audemars Piguet, the watchmaker, to become a chocolatier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, she moved to Paris to apprentice with a master chocolatier. Visions of decadent bonbons swirled in her head. Instead, she felt like a modern-day Lucy in the candy factory, hunched over in a chocolate lab packing chocolates and scrubbing pots. If she wasn't doing that, she was sweeping floors, wrapping gifts, answering telephones or shipping orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After four months, she had had enough and called it quits. Her Plan C? She returned to New York and took a job with her old boss, doing marketing for another luxury brand. ''It got very lonely, to be honest,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS is not to say that success is unattainable. Martha Stewart, after all, became Martha Stewart as a Plan B after abandoning a career as a stockbroker. And with the exception of Ms. Vibert, everyone interviewed said that despite the unforeseen bumps, they would not trade their new lives for their old jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I no longer walk with a slight depressed hunch,'' said Ms. Herrington, the wedding planner, who is now enjoying steady work and glowing write-ups in wedding blogs like 100 Layer Cake. Her friends, she added, said they noticed an instant improvement in her appearance, too. ''I no longer see chunks of hair falling out due to stress.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, I never wanted to talk about work, other than to complain,'' she added. ''Now I like talking about my work so much that my husband has to actually ask me not to talk about it all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Economou, the Greek baker, says she feels spiritually transformed. ''I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary, and I love it,'' she said. ''I love being a part of the neighborhood. I didn't realize how you become friends with your customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Ms. Alpers, the cookbook photographer, said the hard work and anxiety are starting to pay off, creatively and financially. Lately, she has shot covers for a crime novel and a nonfiction book about ghosts, and took photos for an Angry Birds tie-in cookbook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though I hate taking on all the responsibility myself and I'm often crazed,'' she said, ''the moment that I hold a book I've completed, it makes up for all the uncertainty of getting there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 21, 2011, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Picture captions last Sunday with an article about the difficulty of midlife career changes misspelled the surname of a former textile design director who opened an antiques and jewelry store. As the article correctly noted, she is Anne McInnis, not McInnes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- Before she arrived in this mecca of migrant labor at age 48, Evelyn Naces, a Filipino nurse, had never owned a credit card. Soon she had 14 of them -- and like thousands of other foreign workers here, a trip to debtors' prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When they put me in shackles, that was the worst,'' said Ms. Naces, who had $27,000 in unpaid bills, mostly from helping her grown son start a business back in the Philippines that later failed. ''I felt so degraded.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, banks all but threw credit cards at the foreigners who come here in droves to work the malls and fill the office towers. The workers, many of them raised in poor countries and new to easy credit, spent beyond their means. Staggering losses followed, with jail terms common for those who could not pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether cast as reckless lending or heedless borrowing, their stories offer an unusual glimpse of the hidden emotions -- webs of pride, guilt and family obligation -- that follow millions of migrants across the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some shopped for pleasure, but many ran up bills by answering pleas from poor relatives for needs as varied as livestock and medical care. The ability to say ''no'' seldom felt like an option. Still others, feeling uprooted, built houses back home that they might never occupy. Some mothers who left their children behind tried to salve guilty feelings with expensive gifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The family back home often thinks the migrant is earning a lot and raises its expectations,'' said Grace Princesa, the Philippine ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, who has made debt reduction a part of a government campaign to improve conditions for migrants. ''The poor migrant goes deeper into debt just to answer. It's a vicious cycle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such was the case with Ms. Naces, now 52, a single mother who left her infant son with her parents and went to Saudi Arabia to make money to support him. By the time she arrived in the Emirates in 2007, he had already grown up without her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though she could not get a credit card in Saudi Arabia, in the Emirates she could scarcely avoid one. Salesmen stalked nurses outside hospitals and worshipers after Mass at a Filipino church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Naces bought furniture, clothes and meals for herself, but her biggest expenses involved her son, whose affection she feared she had lost. She built him a house in the Philippines and bought five cars with credit cards so he could start a rental business. ''I felt guilty for being away and not raising him,'' she said. ''I was trying to compensate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They both went to jail -- he on drug charges and she for debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the government does not disclose how many debtors have been jailed, a legislative body several years ago estimated that 10,000 of them were in the courts or prison. The Dubai police chief has complained that debtors needlessly clog the jails, and employers have warned the Ministry of Labor that debt problems distract employees. About 85 percent of the country's population -- and 99 percent of the private work force -- consists of foreign workers, and local officials keep watch for signs of discontent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The employers were saying, 'This is a priority to us,' '' said Qassim Jamil, a senior official in the Labor Ministry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Central Bank tightened lending rules this year, and the Labor Ministry sponsored a financial literacy program for migrant leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What do we want? Freedom!'' Ms. Princesa, the ambassador, chanted at a session for Filipinos. ''Freedom from poverty! Freedom from credit card problems! Freedom from bank problems!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If migrants spent heavily, lenders encouraged them. Traditionally, credit card use was low (in part because of Islamic strictures against charging interest), but banks spotted a new market and moved aggressively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With foreign banks like <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> fighting locals for market share, the number of cards leapt to four million in 2008, a fivefold increase in five years, according to the <span class="companylink">Lafferty Group</span>, a London research firm. But the country lacks a reliable credit bureau, so lenders could not tell how many cards or how much debt the borrowers carried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks were falling over themselves to lend, and they didn't have proper credit checks,'' said Andrew Neeson, a Lafferty analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Courted with gifts and teaser rates, few borrowers understood the costs. The average interest rate in the Emirates last year, at 36 percent, was more than twice the global average, and banks routinely add another 10 percent for disability and death insurance. With penalties, some workers borrowed at rates of 50 percent or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone can be tempted by easy credit, but migrants raised in poverty can find the glittering malls here especially intoxicating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first time I used my card, I felt amazed,'' Ms. Naces said. ''It's a feeling of excitement, power -- greatness even.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rex Arcenio, a Filipino optometrist, accepted a gold card because it came with a Montblanc pen and a limousine ride to the airport for his annual leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like a status symbol,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ran up $50,000 in debt -- for his children's education, his brother's cancer treatment and a house in Manila -- and was briefly jailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, debtors go to jail for bouncing the blank ''security checks'' they must sign when accepting a card. If borrowers fail to pay, banks can deposit the checks for the sum owed, and bouncing a check is a crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether foreign or Emirati, borrowers must repay the debt after leaving jail, though banks often accept reduced terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skilled workers here are generally treated better than in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, which can make their debt travails a shock. Jail conditions in the Emirates are described as comfortable, but the accused often appear in court in leg irons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My world collapsed,'' said Mr. Arcenio, a proud man in a white lab coat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aisha Alambatang, 54, who served a month for one card in February, could be jailed again for others. A Filipino nurse with three grown children, Ms. Alambatang spent most of their childhood years abroad, supporting them from Saudi Arabia. When she arrived in the Emirates eight years ago, she got a raise and six credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She built houses for herself and her daughter and helped the children start several failed businesses. Then she paid for two to move to Abu Dhabi to job hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon she had a monthly salary of $2,200 and debt service of more than $3,000. Her daughter was in court when Ms. Alambatang arrived. ''When my daughter saw me with a chain on my foot, I felt like my heart was broken,'' she said. Worried about returning to jail, Ms. Alambatang gets palpitations when she sees the police, and she sleeps with her daughter for comfort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not in jail anymore, but here,'' she said, hand over her heart, ''I'm more in jail.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hari Kaur has been teaching yoga for 20 years as a private instructor and at other people's studios, most recently in New York, but it was only late last year that she decided she wanted to start her own Jazz Yoga school -- the world's first, as far as she knew. What she didn't know was much about how to start and run a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of her students happened to be an experienced entrepreneur who had recently started his fourth company, and he gave her some smart-sounding advice on funding, marketing and leasing a space. When she came up with more questions, he told her she ought to check out that latest business of his, which happened to be a free online service focused on ... how to start a company.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web-based tools are becoming nearly essential to many aspects of running a business, so why not bring them into the process of creating and executing a business plan? That's the idea behind Wicked Start, the brain child of Bryan Janeczko, the yoga student. Mr. Janeczko had been a management consultant at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, and then on his own, and later did a stint as a vice president at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>. But his real entrepreneurial awakening occurred, he said, when in 2003 he set out to found a company that delivered meals to dieters: ''I thought, 'I'm smart, I have an M.B.A., how hard could this be?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know the answer to that one. ''When you work for a company, you have certain well-defined responsibilities,'' he said. ''When you're an entrepreneur, you do it all, and from the ground up. You need to deal with the legal work, building a Web site, setting customer service policy. People go into starting a company optimistically, and blindly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But against the odds, and not without struggle, Mr. Janeczko steered his Long Island City, N.Y., start-up, called Nu-Kitchen, to sales that doubled annually through 2008, when the company was snatched up by the diet industry giant NutriSystem for a reported initial payment of $4 million. After that he started a nonprofit organization called StartOut to support entrepreneurship within the gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender community. He also found himself in demand on the speaker circuit and among would-be entrepreneurs as a source of advice -- and noticed that he was cautioning people about the same basic mistakes over and over again. That's what led him to introduce Wicked Start last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heart of Wicked Start is a series of customizable templates for each of 10 steps in starting up a business, running from producing a business plan to raising money to building the company's infrastructure to marketing, and more. The site automatically tailors the templates to any of several industries, such as brick-and-mortar retail, e-commerce, consulting or food services, covering about 70 percent of start-ups, according to Mr. Janeczko, and users can further customize as needed. Each template lays out action items, including pinning down your business idea and creating PowerPoint presentations to hit up friends and relatives for financing. It goes on to help with taking on partners, setting up a marketing plan and signing a lease. The items prompt you to set deadlines and to create e-mail reminders to nudge you to stay on track. In a sense, it's a project management tool that's been thoroughly adapted to the project of getting a company off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Janeczko takes pains to point out that he's not trying to force entrepreneurs to stick to a rigid, one-size-fits-all script. ''Only about a third of our users do all the steps in sequence,'' he said. For each step, the site also offers advice in various forms, including videos of successful entrepreneurs and other experts talking about what works, as well as community forums and articles. Mr. Janeczko hopes the advice, combined with the template structure, will help company builders avoid making those mistakes he kept hearing about when he was giving out advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One common mistake is underestimating how much time and money it takes to get to the point where the company is taking in real money -- first-time entrepreneurs are usually off by a factor of at least two, he said. Another is failing to focus the business idea. ''People are way too broad about what problem they're trying to solve or what market they want to address,'' he said. ''It's much better to pick a narrow, well-defined problem and market, make it work, and then you can expand it later.'' The site pounds away at these points, along with others, such as not wasting marketing funds on paid advertising when there's so much free marketing to be had via social networks and word of mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kaur, the yoga teacher, said Wicked Start, which unveiled an expanded version earlier this month, had been an enormous boon. ''I'm a creative person, my weakness is setting up the infrastructure of a business,'' she said. ''I didn't know how to find the right computer tools, or how to be able to accept credit cards. I keep coming back to the site for extra help, step by step.'' Ms. Kaur opened her studio, Hari NYC, a few months ago, and she says so far she's stayed with the 60-day plan she set up on Wicked Start, and she's doing well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'll mention one other tool, though of a different sort, that may be helpful to getting a business going. That's BizTree, a downloadable trove of document templates intended to shave time and expense off of just about every one of the nuts and bolts required to put a company together and keep it running. There's no advice or structure to be gained from BizTree, which costs $249.95, but whatever specific task it is you want to do -- hire an employee, take on a partner, sign a lease, put together a marketing plan -- BizTree will hand you the sort of document you'll need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saul Bienenfeld, who runs a single-lawyer practice with three employees in New York, said that even as a lawyer himself he saved a lot of time adapting BizTree contracts for his own business as well as on behalf of his clients. And he insisted BizTree had helped him head off potential employee hassles by providing him with hiring and firing forms, and an employee handbook that covers everything from sexual harassment to absenteeism to no-smoking policies.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Jerry Brown of California announced a rare bipartisan agreement with legislative leaders Thursday, eliminating a tax loophole for out-of-state businesses that opponents said encouraged moving jobs out of the state. The deal will allow the state to lower personal income taxes and provide more incentives to small companies based in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown, a Democrat who has been unable to win Republican support for many of his proposals, negotiated the deal with Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, a Republican from San Diego. The governor and lawmakers said the plan would generate more jobs, but did not provide numbers or specific projections.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democratic leaders said they expected some opposition from Republicans in the Senate, whose support they would need to approve the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan would require companies to base their tax calculations exclusively on the amount of sales they have in California. That would raise about $1 billion annually beginning in the 2013 fiscal year, primarily from out-of-state companies, which would then be used to create tax breaks for individual taxpayers and businesses based in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing companies that are just starting up would receive a 4 percent sales tax decrease for equipment purchases and other companies would receive a 1 percent cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal also includes several business tax breaks, like a cut in the minimum tax for all businesses to $750 from $800 and a cut in the corporate tax rate by half a percentage point, to 8.34 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standard deduction for personal income tax would grow by $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tobacco companies had been among the primary beneficiaries of the previous tax plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Kabateck, the executive director of the California office of National Federation of Independent Business, said the move would go a long way in ''restoring hope.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans, predictably, are denouncing President Obama's proposal to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations to help wrestle down the nation's budget deficit and pay for his job creation plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was the usual silly talk about class warfare against the rich. But the politicians insisted that their real concern was for middle-class Americans and the economy. Rick Perry said the president's plan ''penalizes investment when it is needed most.'' Mitt Romney blasted the plan's ''crushing impact on economic growth.'' A spokesman for John Boehner, the House speaker, called it a collection of ''job-killing small-business tax hikes.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans need to take a close look at what Mr. Obama is calling for: a broad tax reform that raises $1.5 trillion over a decade but allows for lower rates on businesses and individuals by cutting tax breaks and loopholes for special interests, and that restores some fairness to a system in which millionaires and billionaires pay lower tax rates than middle-class families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans want to close the entire budget gap by slashing government spending. The president's balanced approach protects vital services and growth. It includes $245 billion in payroll tax cuts next year for workers and businesses to encourage hiring, investment and spending. It also includes money to invest in infrastructure and to aid struggling states. It only starts reducing the budget deficit in 2013, when the economy should be stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is his wont, the president is still leaving too many details for Congress to decide. But here is a closer look at some of the ideas he has put on the table:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGHER TAXES FOR THE RICH The Obama plan would allow the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans -- individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and households earning more than $250,000 -- to expire at the end of 2012. That would restore the top two marginal tax rates to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, up from 33 percent and 35 percent today. It would also restore the estate tax, which vanished completely in 2010, and raise the capital gains tax on wealthy individuals from 15 percent to 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full Bush-era tax cuts were the single biggest contributor to the deficit over the past decade, reducing revenues by about $1.8 trillion between 2002 and 2009. The White House estimates that Mr. Obama's plan would raise $866 billion over the next decade, or nearly half of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the supposed job-killing effects, President Bill Clinton raised tax rates to where Mr. Obama wants to restore them now, and the economy grew faster and added many more jobs during those eight years than it did after President George W. Bush slashed taxes across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans are undaunted. Their main claim -- delivered in a conveniently populist tone -- is that the higher rates will penalize small businesses that file as individuals. Small businesses are undeniably major engines of job creation. But only about 2.5 percent of all small-business owners (and 4 percent of those reporting positive income) earn enough to be taxed at the top two rates, according to the Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis. Even more important, the argument ignores the fact that the higher income tax rate would apply to business profits, not revenues. Small businesses would still be able to deduct or amortize payrolls and investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics also claim that raising the capital gains rate would hamstring investment. But economists studying the historical record have concluded that the effect is small, dwarfed by considerations like profit growth. The truth is that despite the current low tax rates, American businesses -- small and big -- are investing very little. Business surveys show that the main reason is that there are very few customers with money to buy their products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE 'BUFFETT RULE' President Obama has said that tax reform should follow the principle that no household making $1 million or more should pay a smaller share of its income in taxes than a middle-class family. Republicans say this is an act of ''class warfare.'' But it is clearly unjust to have a tax system that, today, allows 22,000 households earning more than $1 million to pay less than 15 percent of their income in federal income and payroll taxes -- less than half of what a middle-class family pays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama did not specify how he would satisfy the Buffett rule. Allowing the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy to expire would go some way in this direction. So would his proposal to require managers of hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment vehicles to pay standard income taxes on their pay, rather than paying at the much lower capital gains rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPPING DEDUCTIONS FOR THE WEALTHY Many wealthy Americans reap bigger gains from their tax deductions -- of mortgage payments, charitable contributions and the like -- than the middle class. Taxed at the top marginal rate of 35 percent, they get back 35 cents out of every dollar of authorized deductions. Middle-class filers, who pay a marginal rate of 28 percent, get only 28 cents back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's proposal would cap the benefit at 28 percent for wealthy taxpayers, raising about $410 billion over 10 years, according to the White House. The idea tracks those proposed by Martin Feldstein, Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw, top economic advisers to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORPORATE LOOPHOLES Mr. Obama is also calling for eliminating unnecessary tax breaks and subsidies for oil companies, the coal industry and others to raise about $300 billion over 10 years. That is drawing fierce criticism from Republicans and some Democrats, eager to shield big campaign donors. These scams need to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama was right when he told Congress that the country has choices to make. ''Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires? Or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs? Right now, we can't afford to do both.'' His argument is sound, and so is the economics behind it. That won't stop his critics. He needs to keep pushing back.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a hot summer day in Manaus, Brazil, Diana Taylor, the former banking superintendent of New York and longtime companion of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was strolling through a slum. A city of about two million in the middle of the Amazon, Manaus is where the Boston-based microfinance group Accion International started an ambitious lending operation in February, and Taylor, who is chairwoman of the group's board, had flown down with a delegation of staff and investors to observe how the experiment was coming along on the ground. Nearly six feet tall, thin and wearing large, round sunglasses, khaki pants and leather driving moccasins that had the kind of distressed effect only years of wear can produce, Taylor did not blend in.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as pedestrians paused to stare, she neither reveled in the attention nor was fazed by it, instead noting details of the storefronts she passed: whether they had adequate signage, say, or were advantageously located in front of a bus stop. After two blocks, having passed four businesses bearing stickers with Accion's logo - indications that the owners had taken out loans - Taylor stopped in front of a cellphone supply kiosk. ''These are really smart,'' she said, pointing to a sticker in the shop's window. ''We should have them everywhere!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With some 30 affiliates in 23 countries, Accion is among the biggest organizations that do microlending - that is, make small loans to the poor as an antipoverty strategy. It is also one of the oldest; this year is the group's 50th anniversary. But in the large and varied constellation of microfinance groups, it is most known for developing and promoting a profit-making approach to the work. The commercial model worries factions of the microfinance world that find a for-profit drive at odds with a mission to lift the poor out of poverty. It does not worry Taylor, who, despite a mild distaste for the limelight - and increasing scrutiny of all microlending - is quietly emerging as one of its most influential proponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The hope is that we can test it here and really prove that it can be done,'' Taylor said. We were in a van on our way to visit more clients, ''microentrepreneurs'' in the parlance, across town. ''Then we can attract more capital.'' So far, she seemed pleased. There were Accion billboards at key intersections, a truck with a sound system affixed to its roof blasting an Accion ad, and, in one outdoor market, an Accion jingle playing over a loudspeaker. Of the dozen or so clients she had met with - fruit vendors, seamstresses, seafood sellers - most said they hoped to take out another loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor wound down the afternoon at Salon Pop Star, a barbershop on the edge of town that had been renovated with money from an Accion loan. As she had been with all the clients that day, she was warm and engaging with the salon's owner, Levistone Melo, 29. He answered her questions between snips of a customer's hair: his loan was for $1,000 and carried a monthly interest rate of 3.8 percent; he had a year to pay it off; with it, he purchased a second barber chair and better hair products, installed a bathroom and hired an employee; he estimated that he had seen a 50 percent uptick in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly half an hour, Taylor glanced at the mirror and ran a hand through her own hair. ''The weather here is so damp, my hair needs a lot of work,'' she said. Having finished with his customer, whose hair was cropped into blunt, angular lines that would meet army grooming standards, Melo motioned for Taylor to have a seat in the barber chair. She flashed a broad smile, then waved away the offer. ''I'm fine, thank you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diana Taylor grew up in Old Greenwich, Conn., with all the usual old-money trappings - skiing, sailing, rowing crew and playing tennis and lacrosse. Though her great-grandfather, an investment banker, helped finance the Spence School, she attended Milton Academy and then Dartmouth, graduating with a degree in economics. She went on to a dual-degree program in business and public health at Columbia but left with only the M.B.A. portion to take a job as an investment banker at Smith Barney. Midcareer, she decided to try government work and held various positions in the Pataki administration. She met Bloomberg in 2000 at a lunch, where the two were seated next to each other. At a dinner the following night, ''I looked up at one point and Mike was looking at me, so I waved at him. He asked me out for a drink afterwards, and that was that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was during her stint as superintendent of banks, from 2003 to 2007, that she took an interest in why some people were left out of the banking system altogether. It was hard not to notice a correlation, she said, between a map of the city's poor, minority populations and a map of the so-called unbanked. She started a program to give incentives to banks to open branches in these areas (Bedford-Stuyvesant, East Harlem), with some success. In part to better understand development economics, in 2005, during Bloomberg's re-election bid, she decided to finish the degree she'd started years before at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, cramming for exams in the back of the campaign bus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the same time, the United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of Microcredit. ''I didn't know very much about microfinance at all,'' she said, ''except that it was this thing where you make very small loans to very poor people and they build businesses, and I thought that sounded like a really good idea.'' Taylor went to several United Nations-sponsored events and found that the premise of microfinance - that the poor are often ingenious handlers of money, but merely face obstacles to saving money and growing businesses - spoke to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's absolutely astounding how enterprising people are,'' she said at a lunch meeting in Manaus. The 40 or so staff members, investors and other assorted ''Accionistas'' had gathered at the organization's first Manaus branch, a sun-filled storefront. A line of prospective borrowers was forming nearby. ''The ability to smooth out consumption when your income is very wobbly, and to figure out how to store value when you have no bank, is very sophisticated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor first became involved with Accion shortly after meeting Maria Otero, then the president and C.E.O. (Otero is now Hillary Clinton's under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs.) Started in 1961 as a student-run volunteer program in the shantytowns of Caracas, Accion had been issuing microloans since 1973 and urging commercialization of the movement since the 1990s. (An Accion affiliate, BancoSol in Bolivia, became the first private commercial bank dedicated to microfinance in 1992.) Taylor agreed with Otero's view that the only way microfinance could ever help largenumbers of people - could achieve ''scale'' in industry-speak - was by tapping capital markets. They became fast friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She not only understood and cared a great deal about it, she had a remarkable ability to straddle the world of high finance and the needs of the poor,'' Otero said. ''I was completely taken with the clearness and earnestness of her approach, but also the power she brought.'' In 2006, Otero asked Taylor to join Accion's board. ''She accepted immediately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microfinance was having a moment. Investments in the sector were doubling; Bill Clinton and Natalie Portman were singing its praises; and Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span> in Bangladesh and co-winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in microlending, was predicting that by 2030 there would be ''poverty museums.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Taylor earned a reputation as a rigorous watchdog, opposing a 2004 decision that allowed banks to evade state supervision and warning of dubious loan products, she stepped down as bank superintendent in 2007, joined a private investment firm and took on more at Accion. ''I saw in her a woman leader, a woman who had operated so effectively in a world of men,'' Otero said. ''She dealt with bankers nonstop and navigated all of it with a manner that was not only not brusque and abrasive, but the opposite.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the trip to Manaus, Taylor wielded her influence subtly and seemed determined to deflect credit for what staff and investors described as a key role in obtaining licenses to open the northern Brazil branch. The process took three years and ultimately required an approval from President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The closest she came to acknowledging her part was during opening remarks she delivered on the first day, when she allowed that she had met with the minister of finance and ''tried desperately'' to get the O.K.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor became chairwoman of Accion's board in June 2009. She joined the board of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> that same summer, and it seems no accident that a key subsequent Accion hire came from the bank. When Hillary Clinton tapped Otero, Otero's position was filled by Michael Schlein, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s president of international franchise management. The microfinance sector continued to grow, despite - and in some places because of - the widening credit crisis. The total volume of microloans rose from $8.5 billion in 2003 to $71 billion in 2009, and investment in the sector grew from $1.4 billion in 2003 to $19.5 billion in 2009, according to M.I.X. (Microfinance Information Exchange).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the end of 2010, a backlash of opinion had taken firm hold. A few studies, notably one led by M.I.T.'s Esther Duflo and others, concluded that benefits for microfinance borrowers were real but modest at best. Lenders from Bangladesh to Nicaragua had come under scrutiny. In Andhra Pradesh, one of India's largest states, many borrowers stopped repaying their loans, and more than 80 people there committed suicide after defaulting. In an op-ed in The New York Times in January, Muhammad Yunus blamed commercialization. ''Poverty should be eradicated,'' he wrote, ''not seen as a moneymaking opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The critics of microfinance might be said to fall into two categories: those who feel it does some good, just not all that its most fervent proselytizers claim it does; and those who feel it does borrowers harm. The first group is inclined to see the backfire as an inevitable result of the overselling of microfinance's promise, and to feel that, in whipping up so much hype, microlenders have in a sense been their own worst enemy. This is not a take that Taylor disputes. (''There is no silver bullet for poverty alleviation,'' she told me.) The second group tends to point to the situation in India and say that microlenders, with their necessarily high cost of services, cannot but sink borrowers into debt. Where Yunus faults the profit motive, arguing that it will lead inexorably to ''mission drift,'' Taylor contends that the solution is strong regulation, not abandonment of commercial microfinance. ''There are ways to abuse the microfinance system, just like there are ways to abuse the mortgage system,'' she said. ''The solution is not to ban mortgages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming on the heels of the backlash, the three-day trip at times took on the feel of a pep rally. One evening, the Accion delegation gathered for dinner in an ornate banquet hall. As a Brazilian band played Beatles covers, an elegantly dressed wait staff served steak and Champagne. The president and C.E.O., Michael Schlein, stood at a microphone and told of Ana Ferreira, one of the first borrowers in Manaus. Before her loan, Ferreira, a seamstress, spent mornings buying as much fabric as she could afford, which was enough for one afternoon of work. With the loan, she could buy fabric in bulk, freeing up her mornings and allowing her to double her productivity. ''It's so simple,'' Schlein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the end of the night, a troupe of dancers wearing feather headdresses, bikinis and loincloths performed, drawing guests from their seats for samba lessons. Among those coaxed into shimmying on the floor were Taylor, Schlein and Livy Parsons, Accion's C.F.O. ''This happens a lot at Accion,'' said Bruce MacDonald, an Accion spokesman. ''Every time we have a ceremony, there's native dancing involved.'' When the music ended, Parsons ambled over to the sidelines. ''Well, next time I'm approached by 15 people in Amazonian dress, I'll know just what to do,'' he said, wiping his brow. ''That never happened to me in banking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part because of her prescient moves as banking superintendent, Taylor is increasingly seen as a potential political candidate. She has been approached about running for office by Republican lawmakers and operatives, who have described her variously as a ''perfect candidate,'' a ''shoo-in'' and a ''grand-slam home run.'' Unusually, her appeal extends to the other side of the aisle, and beyond. (Speaking at an Accion event in Ghana, Bono once teased, ''Diana, you know how I feel about you. But don't tell the mayor.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For her part, Taylor has signaled an interest in politics, considering both a nomination to head the F.D.I.C. in 2006 and a campaign for United States Senate in 2010, but these days seems decidedly averse to a position on the federal side. Over breakfast in Manaus, I asked about her decision not to run against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand last year. ''You run, and then you either give an acceptance or concession speech. I thought, Concession speech? Easy. Acceptance speech? Not so much.'' Why? ''Because then you have to go to Washington!'' She went on, ''If I were to run for something, it would be something in New York, on the executive side.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a nearby table sat a newspaper that had a photo of Taylor - ''la primeira-dama de Nova York'' - next to an article on the Manaus operation. On the now unlikely prospect that she might find herself first girlfriend of the United States, she had this to say: ''I think he'd be a really good president, but personally, it would be horrible. I told Mike the No. 1 reason he couldn't run for president is I wouldn't be able to swear on the golf course anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that morning, Taylor joined the others for a boat ride up the Amazon, past pink dolphins and flooded tree canopies to the confluence of the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes, where the two tributaries meet but do not mix, forming a stark line between dark and sand-colored waters. ''I have something to add,'' she said. ''Microfinance is about helping people help themselves, about helping people think of themselves as productive human beings who have some merit to society. What's the message of a subsidy? That you have nothing to give. This approach says, 'You don't have to just sit there in abject poverty and take it.' '' Not long later, the boat docked and Taylor and a few staff members boarded a bus, which took them to her jet for the flight back to New York.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS Congress considers President Obama's job package, one measure seems to have rare bipartisan support: a proposal to loosen some of the outdated securities regulations that hamper small businesses in raising capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration, not surprisingly considering its own success in gathering small donations during his campaign for the presidency, is supporting crowdfunding, a financing model that relies on collecting small sums of money from many people over the Internet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding has the sort of populist, common-sense appeal that resonates with free-market libertarians and champions of the working class. By marrying online social networks with finance, this model offers a more democratic model of finance, in which individuals can directly fund other individuals or businesses that they deem worthy, without going through a bank or Wall Street middleman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the sort of person-to-person (or P2P, in industry jargon) funding that characterized financial transactions for millennia, before our mediated, securitized financial system took hold. The popular appeal of crowdfunding can be seen in the success of sites like Kiva, a microlender, and Kickstarter, which lets people donate money to artistic ventures. In its first six years, Kiva has arranged nearly $250 million in loans from more than 600,000 individuals to microentrepreneurs around the globe. Kickstarter users are pledging funds at a rate of $2 million a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's be clear: this is philanthropy. In the case of Kiva, lenders get their money back (assuming there is no default), but earn no interest. And beyond a few tokens of appreciation, Kickstarter members get only the satisfaction of seeing an undertaking they support come to life. That's because if either site were to allow members to earn a return on their money, they would be subject to federal and state laws governing the sale of securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under those laws, crafted largely in the 1930s, the sites would have to either limit the fund-raising to wealthy investors, who the S.E.C. deems sophisticated, or go through a registration process that would prove too costly given the small sums being sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a glimpse of what is possible, look at Britain, where securities laws are helpful to crowdfunding and several start-ups are vying to be the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> of finance. The year-old Funding Circle, a business-lending site based in London, raises more than $2.3 million each month for small businesses from individuals who can invest as little as $30 and earn an average yield of roughly 7.3 percent after fees. Those are loans; two other start-ups are applying the model to equity shares in small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, these outdated laws are cutting off a huge pool of potential capital for small, private businesses that have been all but abandoned by banks and Wall Street. The proposed crowdfunding changes would make it easier for entrepreneurs to tap ordinary investors -- often customers or people in their social networks -- for funds, with the promise of a return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering proposals to ease restrictions on crowdfunding. One petition, prepared in 2010 by the Sustainable Economies Law Center and, fittingly, paid for by a grass-roots crowdfunding effort, asks the S.E.C. to permit entrepreneurs to raise up to $100 per individual and an aggregate of up to $100,000 without requiring expensive registration and disclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama, as part of his jobs act, advocates an exemption for sums totaling up to $1 million. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, has drafted legislation that would allow companies to obtain up to $5 million from individuals through crowdfunded ventures, with a cap of $10,000 per investor, or 10 percent of their annual incomes, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are real concerns. The S.E.C. must balance its dual mission of facilitating investment and protecting investors, and as we all know, snake-oil salesmen are alive and well on the Internet. Furthermore, Wall Street banks are likely to fight any efforts to encourage crowdfunding because it cuts them out of the equation. But the potential rewards outweigh the risks. With such sums, the hazard to any single investor is limited. And information is more freely available today than in the 1930s, when the regulations were written.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, isn't this the type of innovation we should be encouraging? Unlike exotic derivatives and super-fast trading algorithms, crowdfunding generates capital for job-creating small businesses. As Congress debates the merits of the president's jobs plan, a crowdfunding exemption should be given a serious hearing -- and the slow-moving S.E.C. a serious prod.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The public markets have really become like a casino.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's how Barry Silbert, the chief executive of SecondMarket, the fast-growing private stock exchange for start-ups, views trading on the big exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you don't know SecondMarket, you should: Whenever you hear about companies like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> being valued at as much as $100 billion or Groupon at $15 billion -- before they've had an initial public offering -- the sky-high values are in large part being set on exchanges like SecondMarket, which allow wealthy investors to trade shares of private companies in the secondary market. Think of it as an <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for shares of private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some people might consider that a casino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they would be wrong. Mr. Silbert's company is trying to rewrite the rules of investing by creating an exchange for investors, not just traders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Tuesday, Mr. Silbert is taking an unusual step: He is listing his own company's private shares on SecondMarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last several weeks, he secretly ran a private electronic auction on SecondMarket for a slice of the company. A handful of the most influential investors in the start-up world have taken stakes in SecondMarket, including the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>-backed fund, the Social + Capital Partnership; Yuri Milner, the Russian investor with stakes in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter, Groupon and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>; and Ashton Kutcher's investment vehicle A Grade Investments. (Yes, that Ashton Kutcher.) In total, SecondMarket raised $13 million at a valuation of $160 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that may seem like small potatoes compared with <span class="companylink">NYSE Euronext</span> -- which has a valuation of $6.5 billion -- the story of SecondMarket is worth considering against the backdrop of what seems like out-of-control volatility in the public stock market and an anemic market for I.P.O.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silbert, who looks even younger than his 35 years, set out in 2004 to create a market for secondary shares, allowing employees and investors of private companies that are often too small to go public to sell their shares on an exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His exchange allows for certain rules that the public market does not: a company selling shares on SecondMarket can choose which investors are allowed to buy -- weeding out fast-buck artists -- and how frequently they can trade those shares. If a company wants to allow investors to trade their shares only twice a year on specific dates, that's fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefits are obvious: employees and investors can cash out some of their stakes without having to go through the formal and rigorous process of an initial public offering. That, in turn, can allow traditionally cash-poor pre-I.P.O. employees, for example, to afford to stay at an emerging company that might not be ready to pursue an I.P.O. until it matures some more. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also creates a real market, with real values -- ''price discovery'' in Wall street parlance -- for pre-I.P.O. companies as opposed to the made-up valuations that venture capital firms often put on companies in successive series of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drawbacks are also obvious: Employees and investors who sell shares early may not be as aligned with the company. And the private market does not come with all the disclosures that a public offering would, making it rife for abuse if not properly monitored. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been studying this emerging industry in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In truth, Mr. Silbert's company should probably not exist. Its success is a function of a series of rules and regulatory changes over the last decade that has upended the public stock market for start-ups. (His company competes with a smaller rival, SharePost.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just consider this: ''Back in the '80s and '90s, there was 400 to 500 I.P.O.'s happening a year,'' Mr. Silbert said. ''If you look over the past decade, a good year is 150 I.P.O.'s and bad year, like it was last year and the year before, is well below 100. That is kind of scary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And here's another scary series of numbers: The average time it took in the 1980s and 1990s for a company to go public from when it was founded was four to five years. Today it is 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some companies, especially in the late 1990s, may have gone public too quickly or should have never done so at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But taken together, the statistics demonstrate that it is much more challenging to gain access to the public capital markets -- and may ultimately make it harder for entrepreneurs to start and grow small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The I.P.O. market really dying a slow death,'' Mr. Silbert said, hardly happy about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear Mr. Silbert tell it, the death of the I.P.O. market has its roots in the end of research from investment banks and the move to online trading brokers like E*Trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Back in the day, you would have literally hundreds of thousands of brokers making calls every single day pushing what were typically smaller-cap stocks,'' he said. ''That ended when you shifted to online brokers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those brokers used research, which has now dried up, to back up their sales calls. (Again, there is a flip side to this argument: some of that ''research'' was conflicted and there were also boiler-room style brokerage shops that abused unsuspecting investors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, start-ups can monetize at least part of their business. SecondMarket, for example, has been a boon to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> because many of its early employees have been able to cash out some of their shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, has donated $100 million to the Newark schools, a prospect that would have been more difficult without a robust market for the company's shares in the secondary market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of SecondMarket's offering, employees were allowed to cash out up to 30 percent of their shares through the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silbert was the largest seller. He demurred to say exactly how much money he ''took off the table'' except to say it represented only 10 percent of his holdings of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how did Mr. Silbert feel about, as he said, ''eating his own cooking?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We weren't like ringing the bell at the exchange, but everybody would gather around the computer screen waiting for what is going to be the best price, highest price,'' he said. ''That was pretty exciting.''</p>

Within four days <span class="companylink">Birdy Nam Nam</span> - think Angry Birds meets Arab Spring - had been downloaded more than 400,000 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His next challenge is to find outside money to make the business grow. Mr. Nader, who developed the program on a shoestring budget of $1,000 with help from his brother and a friend, wants to use the money to add features like online sharing and sound effects. But despite his success, Mr. Nader, 26, stumbled across a potential venture capital investor only by accident.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was at a bar one night and ran into a friend from high school who is the financial director of a VC fund,'' said Mr. Nader, who lives in Beirut. ''I am now working on a proposal for his partners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For budding technology entrepreneurs like Mr. Nader, the fund-raising process is largely informal and unstructured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While venture capital firms have existed in the area for more than a decade, they have generally been offshoots of private equity firms. Typically, they deployed large amounts of capital to a few companies already generating revenue. Young entrepreneurs with promising ideas had few options to finance their ideas, besides rich relatives or family connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a small network of angel investors, incubators and early stage venture capital firms is developing to nurture young start-ups in the Mideast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oasis500, which started last year, wants to invest $30 million in 500 companies across the region by 2014. SeedStartup, an incubator based in Dubai, plans to start a seed fund this month, as does Lebanon's Seeqnce in 2012. PlugandPlay and Tahrir2, technology-focused initiatives in Egypt that began this year, are offering financing and mentorship to entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's easier to get funding for a gas station than to start the next <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or Twitter in the Mideast,'' said Shervin Pishevar, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Menlo Ventures</span> in California who works with Oasis500 as a mentor. ''But this is slowly changing in terms of culture and access to capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort - driven by established Mideast technology executives like Fadi Ghandour of Aramex and Samih Toukan of Maktoob.com, and Silicon Valley stalwarts like Mr. Pishevar - is as much about mentorship as it is about money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oasis500 holds a six-day boot camp for entrepreneurs, where attendees get a crash course in corporate finance, accounting and marketing. The organization also holds events on creating business models and fund-raising. After completing a two-day program, Ramez Kawar, the founder of mustaqil.com, which pairs Arabic-speaking freelancers with projects, secured approximately $14,000 in financing from the organization. He is using the money to advertise more heavily on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and pay back salaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Creating a fund and throwing money at the problem is not enough,'' said Usama Fayyad, the executive chairman of Oasis500 who was previously the chief data officer at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>. ''We focus on addressing the much larger problem of how to train people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its core, Oasis500 is a vast network of leaders in entrepreneurship and technology. In all, the group has more than 60 mentors, including a former Jordanian minister for information technology, Marwan Juma, and Mr. Ghandour, who listed his logistics company, Aramex, on the Nasdaq in 1997 and on the Dubai Financial Market in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such organizations also connect entrepreneurs to angel investors who provide capital for start-ups. Mr. Toukan, who sold the Arabic e-mail Web site Maktoob.com to <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> for a landmark $175 million in 2009, is working with Oasis500, judging investment pitches. The entrepreneur, who was able to secure financing for Maktoob from private equity firms, including $2 million from EFG Hermes and $5 million from <span class="companylink">Abraaj Capital</span>, is considering investing personal money in projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I started Maktoob in 2000, there weren't any real VC firms or investors willing to fund early stage companies, especially Internet companies that didn't make a return for years,'' said Mr. Toukan, who is the chairman of the Jabbar Internet Group. ''The mentality is still new in our part of the world,'' he said. The company also has a venture capital arm that invests in technology companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 25 entrepreneurs have been short-listed for SeedStartup's first incubator. The organization, which is based in Dubai, will make its final selections on Sept. 30. It is ready to give $25,000 to 10 entrepreneurs in exchange for a 10 percent stake in the companies. The top performers will get a chance to apply for a $250,000 investment after the three-month program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with all nascent industries, the Mideast venture capital scene still faces growing pains. The legal and bureaucratic hurdles in the region add a unique layer of complexity. In Dubai, for example, registration costs for new businesses or office space are high, and a bounced check can translate to jail time, according to Habib Haddad, a regional entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors say a cultural shift is taking place. After the revolutions in 2011, Mr. Ghandour of Aramex said that government was paying more attention to job creation, as a way to support the growing young population. And start-ups could play a critical role in that development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will see much more of this because youth are demanding new jobs and at the same time, governments cannot continue to be the main employers,'' Mr. Ghandour said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even with the unstable political climate recently, we've seen how youth responded with heightened social media activity and new online ventures,'' Mr. Toukan said. ''This fresh entrepreneurial spirit is the real Arab Spring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

The article also referred incorrectly to legislation cited in a Web video in which the National Thoroughbred Racing Association told its members about a tax break related to horses and farm equipment.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Taphandles employs 33 people at its headquarters in Seattle and about 450 at the Chinese factory that produces the beer-marketing products it sells to breweries. But its owner, Paul Fichter, who founded the company in 1999 and anticipates $11 million in revenue this year, expects that ratio to change. Mr. Fichter, 40, just signed a lease on a 41,800-square-foot factory in Woodinville, Wash., and began manufacturing some of his products there last month.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Boston Consulting Group</span> analysis released last week found that manufacturing outsourced to China has begun to return to the United States as the economic advantages have started to shift. The analysis predicts that, with Chinese wages rising at 15 to 20 percent a year and with the continued appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar, the gap between the labor costs in Chinese coastal provinces and in America's lower-cost states will shrink to less than 40 percent by around 2015 -- and could lead to the creation of two million to three million jobs in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fichter recently discussed the factors that led him to bring some of his manufacturing back to this country. A condensed version of the conversation follows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why did you decide to open your new factory in the United States?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The lead time for orders coming from China is three weeks, and all of our brewery clients want our products faster -- that's the first thing they say when we meet with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Were there other factors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Once we started looking into it, we found the decision made business sense on many levels. Our Chinese labor costs have increased 300 percent since 2006, when we opened our factory there. Even at the higher wages Chinese workers are demanding, it's gotten harder to find labor. To stay competitive we've also had to upgrade benefits like dormitories and food. On top of that, the Chinese currency continues to appreciate -- it was valued at 8.28 to the dollar when I started the business. Now it's at 6.38. And I predict shipping costs will keep going up as a result of the rising cost of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you see other manufacturers making the same decision?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. While I don't personally know any, I think we're on the leading edge of a trend because the factors that are affecting us affect everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why isn't it happening faster?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Change will take time. Five years ago, there was an absolute advantage to manufacturing in China. Today, some things are better produced here, and some are better produced there. It's 50-50. But I think the U.S. advantage will become clearer with time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Many owners complain about the quality of Chinese goods. Has that been a problem for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No, we opened our own factory in China in 2006. Quality there is good and has never been an issue. But we have had other challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Like what?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I like to do business by the rules, but as an American operating in China, the rules are not always entirely clear. For example, we lost power -- and three days of productivity -- at our Chinese factory in August. Maybe there was something we could have done to get our power turned back on. Meanwhile, our customers were screaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How did you get into this business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. After business school, I worked in manufacturing as a consultant. I figured that if I could tell other companies what to do, I could run my own. So, I began to research businesses I could start with a very small investment. I came across a company that made tap handles for home brewers. They were failing, and I saw why: high labor costs. I decided I could do it better and started Taphandles out of my one-bedroom apartment with an $800 investment in tools and material from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. I started painting tap handles on my balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How did you end up manufacturing in China?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In preparation for a job interview with Breadman, the bread machine company, I'd done a ton of research on their Chinese manufacturing. I decided to use the Breadman model for my business, which would eliminate the high labor costs that contributed to the failure of that other tap handle business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Which products will Taphandles manufacture at its American factory?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. While 98 percent of the tap handles will continue to come from China, we also make signs and displays -- including the A-frame chalkboards you see outside bars. We want to grow this area of the business and had initially planned to do it in China. Instead, we'll be making these products, which are big, bulky and expensive to ship, in Woodinville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How will your costs compare to what you would have paid in China?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We'll break even on production, but come out ahead once we factor in lead time. Right now, we're losing orders because of lead time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What type of work force will you need?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Mostly skilled technicians who can use computer numerical controlled machines, which allow us to cut many products at once. Because <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is nearby, we've got a great labor pool. The cost of computer automation in the United States has also dropped. In China, humans do the same work on much simpler machines. So, we're replacing Chinese labor with machines run by United States workers. The machines will make 10 times more product than a person could in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Are you hiring people away from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No, we don't expect to hire directly from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. But we could wind up hiring people who have worked there in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you finding workers who have the skills you need at the rate you're paying?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes. I recently hired a director of operations to open the United States factory. He had previously run a factory that did the same sort of work for the construction industry. All of his former good, experienced employees are available, so we expect to be able to hire them, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How many jobs do you expect to create?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're in the process of hiring our first five workers and expect to employ 150 at the factory by 2015. Starting base pay will range from $9 to $16 an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How are you financing your expansion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Almost entirely with the tax savings we're realizing because of the law Congress passed at the end of 2010, which allows capital investments to be deducted immediately, not over time. Last year, my tax liability was more than $500,000. This year, because of instant deductibility, I won't have a tax liability. It's an extremely important deduction. Normally, taxes are pretty punitive on growing businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why are you leaving the tap-handle manufacturing in China?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tap handles have very intricate shapes -- for example, the teeth on a whale -- that require detailed hand painting. It's labor that you can't automate. I've searched the world and not been able to find the same quality of labor elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you think Americans still know how to make stuff?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Absolutely. My baby's crib was made here, and that was important to me. I didn't have to worry about the safety of, for example, the paint used. The key to success for the United States will be using machines instead of brawn. When we surveyed other countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, we didn't find the skilled labor base we needed. While I'm really proud of creating jobs here in America, it's not just an emotional decision. It makes sense.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOMES are the primary form of wealth for most Americans. Since the housing bubble burst in 2006, the wealth of American homeowners has fallen by some $9 trillion, or nearly 40 percent. In the 12 months ending in June, house values fell by more than $1 trillion, or 8 percent. That sharp fall in wealth means less consumer spending, leading to less business production and fewer jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for political reasons, both the Obama administration and Republican leaders in Congress have resisted the only real solution: permanently reducing the mortgage debt hanging over America. The resistance is understandable. Voters don't want their tax dollars used to help some homeowners who could afford to pay their mortgages but choose not to because they can default instead, and simply walk away. And voters don't want to provide any more help to the banks that made loans that have gone sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But failure to act means that further declines in home prices will continue, preventing the rise in consumer spending needed for recovery. As costly as it will be to permanently write down mortgages, it will be even costlier to do nothing and run the risk of another recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are falling because millions of homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, and the sale of their foreclosed properties is driving down the prices of all homes. Nearly 15 million homeowners owe more than their homes are worth; in this group, about half the mortgages exceed the home value by more than 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most residential mortgages are effectively nonrecourse loans, meaning creditors can eventually take the house if the homeowner defaults, but cannot take other assets or earnings. Individuals with substantial excess mortgage debt therefore have a strong incentive to stop paying; they can often stay in their homes for a year or more before the property is foreclosed and they are forced to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhang of mortgage debt prevents homeowners from moving to areas where there are better job prospects and from using home equity to finance small business start-ups and expansions. And because their current mortgages exceed the value of their homes, they cannot free up cash by refinancing at low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has tried a variety of programs to reduce monthly interest payments. Those programs failed because they didn't address the real problem: the size of the mortgage exceeds the value of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To halt the fall in house prices, the government should reduce mortgage principal when it exceeds 110 percent of the home value. About 11 million of the nearly 15 million homes that are ''underwater'' are in this category. If everyone eligible participated, the one-time cost would be under $350 billion. Here's how such a policy might work:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the bank or other mortgage holder agrees, the value of the mortgage would be reduced to 110 percent of the home value, with the government absorbing half of the cost of the reduction and the bank absorbing the other half. For the millions of underwater mortgages that are held by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government would just be paying itself. And in exchange for this reduction in principal, the borrower would have to accept that the new mortgage had full recourse -- in other words, the government could go after the borrower's other assets if he defaulted on the home. This would all be voluntary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan is fair because both borrowers and creditors would make sacrifices. The bank would accept the cost of the principal write-down because the resulting loan -- with its lower loan-to-value ratio and its full recourse feature -- would be much less likely to result in default. The borrowers would accept full recourse to get the mortgage reduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a program to stop mortgage defaults, there is no way to know how much further house prices might fall. Although house prices in some areas are already very low, potential buyers continue to wait because they anticipate even lower prices in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the housing bubble burst in 2006, the level of house prices had risen nearly 60 percent above the long-term price path. So there is no knowing how far prices may fall below the long-term path before they begin to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I cannot agree with those who say we should just let house prices continue to fall until they stop by themselves. Although some forest fires are allowed to burn out naturally, no one lets those fires continue to burn when they threaten residential neighborhoods. The fall in house prices is not just a decline in wealth but a decline that depresses consumer spending, making the economy weaker and the loss of jobs much greater. We all have a stake in preventing that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN federal authorities raided the headquarters of the <span class="companylink">Gibson Guitar Corporation</span> in late August, seizing wood they said was illegally exported from India, conservative critics denounced the episode as an example of regulatory overreach. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and now Republican presidential hopeful, accused the Obama administration of having a ''vendetta'' against small businesses; the current speaker, John A. Boehner, invited Gibson's owner, Henry E. Juszkiewicz, to sit in the speaker's box during President Obama's jobs speech last month.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law that investigators enforced in the August raid is indeed flawed -- but not for the reasons critics cite. Large companies like Gibson, if they source their wood carefully, should be O.K. The people who are truly in jeopardy are some of the finest artisanal guitar makers in the United States and Canada. Unlike Gibson, these independent artisans -- also called luthiers -- have been charged with no crime, but their livelihoods and life savings are at risk nonetheless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The root of guitar makers' trouble is the Lacey Act, a law originally enacted in 1900 to prohibit the interstate sale of poached game. In 2008, the act was amended to combat illegal logging around the world. Protections for endangered plants were extended to cover trees logged in violation of foreign law; and importers of wood were required to declare the species and country of harvest for all commercially traded timber, sawed lumber and finished wood products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acting on suspicions raised by inaccurate Lacey declarations, armed agents raided Gibson's factory in Nashville in November 2009 and again in August to determine whether Gibson had accepted ebony imports in violation of laws in Madagascar and India. Gibson has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lacey Act amendments were well intended -- few people wish to encourage illegal logging overseas -- but the act was aimed at bulk freight and industrial inventory, not the practices of luthiers, who hand-select small quantities of wood and season it for decades, often passing it from one generation to the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When importers make declarations under the Lacey Act, they are also claiming that they have complied with other laws, like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. This international treaty, adopted in 1973, outlawed global trade in elephant ivory in 1975 and Brazilian rosewood in 1992. But well-established luthiers -- particularly the 100 or so who have been handcrafting and restoring stringed instruments for over 40 years -- have stockpiles of ivory and wood that were acquired before the bans were put in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While manufacturers have increasingly turned to sustainable alternatives to guitar makers' traditional tonewoods, this option is largely unavailable to artisans who build a small number of instruments each year. Their inability to document the source and age of their materials exposes them to bankrupting fines and confiscations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, North American luthiers now sit on valuable supplies of Brazilian rosewood they are afraid to use, since guitars made with it cannot legally cross American borders -- a liability for traveling musicians and international collectors. For self-employed artisans who often have no health insurance or 401(k) plans, these stashes of rare wood are the only retirement savings they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House members have now put forward a proposal -- the Retailers and Entertainers Lacey Implementation and Enforcement Fairness Act, or the Relief Act -- to limit the declaration requirements under the Lacey amendment to solid wood and commercially imported goods, and to lift declaration requirements for wood and wood products imported or manufactured before May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the bill may help guitar stores and musicians, it fails to address the problem facing artisanal builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easing the declaration requirements doesn't affect the underlying legality of the wildlife materials in a guitar. The international sale of Brazilian rosewood guitars or vintage instruments with ivory nuts and saddles would still be illegal (under the convention) and guitars with decorative inlay could still be detained by customs agents looking for certain species of abalone shell (restricted under the Endangered Species Act).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What artisanal makers urgently need is a way to certify the legality of instruments built with materials they acquired before the trade convention and endangered species laws. Any workable solution needs to acknowledge that an artisanal instrument is not a mass-produced object: it has a unique history and character. For example, it should be enough for luthiers to provide a sworn affidavit to show that their Brazilian rosewood was obtained before 1992. Judgments must be made on a case-by-case basis. That is why many luthiers favor the issuing of passport-like documents, with photographs and serial numbers, for vintage and handmade guitars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gibson case has attracted attention far beyond the noisy agitations of the right -- not because the actions of the federal government were wrong, but because the future of North American guitar making will be in peril if problematic aspects of environmental law are not resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those of us who care about the craft that made the American guitar one of the most desirable instruments in the world are watching the Obama administration closely. And we have reason to be hopeful. After all, this is the president who, with his wife, shortly after taking office, gave Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, France's first lady, a Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar as a gift of friendship.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the start-up announced that it raised a Series A round of cash from a bevy of noted venture capital firms, including Union Square Ventures, O'Reilly Ventures, SV Angel and CrunchFund and from a number of angel investors, including Joshua Schachter, founder of Delicious and Jig.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our main goal is to hire people to help manage content and add new features,'' said Zach Sims, who co-founded Codecademy with Ryan Bubinski, a developer and former classmate at Columbia University. ''Right now, there are still only two of us working on the company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Codecademy was introduced over the summer and has attracted a flurry of interest since then. More than half a million people have used the site and close to 1,000 developers submitted sample lessons to help others learn how to program. The new venture financing will help the company sustain that early traction, Mr. Sims said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're starting to build a community around our lessons,'' he said. In addition, the company said it would use the money to establish its headquarters, which Mr. Sims said wouldl most likely be in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of Mr. Sims's and Mr. Bubinski's vision for the start-up is to give the average person a crash course in computer science -- with built-in rewards to keep them motivated -- either to help jump-start their career as an entrepreneur or help them be a more competitive job candidate in their field. But currently, the coding exercises on Codecademy are largely limited to JavaScript. It would be challenging for anyone to be able to build the next <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or Foursquare after completing the lessons on the site. Mr. Sims says the fresh infusion of cash will help the founders flesh out their course offerings, nudging that notion closer to reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're pushing out more JavaScript courses and getting close to releasing more languages, like Ruby and Python,'' Mr. Sims said. ''As soon as we have more content, this site becomes a very deep experience and way to make basic coding knowledge available to people for free.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OBERLIN, Ohio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN this verdant lawn-filled college town, most people keep their lawn mowers tuned up by oiling the motor and sharpening the blades. Eddie Miller keeps his in shape with salt licks and shearing scissors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, 23, is the founder of Heritage Lawn Mowing, a company that rents out sheep -- yes, sheep -- as a landscaping aid. For a small fee, Mr. Miller, whose official job title is ''shepherd,'' brings his ovine squad to the yards of area homeowners, where the sheep spend anywhere from three hours to several days grazing on grass, weeds and dandelions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, he said, are a win-win: the sheep eat free, saving him hundreds of dollars a month in food costs, and his clients get a freshly cut lawn, with none of the carbon emissions of a conventional gas-powered mower. (There are, of course, other emissions, which Mr. Miller said make for ''all-natural fertilizer.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They countrify a city,'' Mr. Miller said of his four-legged staff. ''And they lend a lot of awareness about how people lived in the past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an uncertain economy and a stagnant hiring climate continue to freeze people out of the traditional job market, a number of entrepreneurs like Mr. Miller, many of them in their 20s and 30s, are heading back to the land, starting small agricultural businesses. And in the process, they are discovering that modern homesteading offers more rewarding work, and possibly more security, than entering the white-collar fray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, a 2010 graduate of Boston University, started his business last year, when several post-college grant applications fell through and no other job opportunities presented themselves. He moved back home and acquired two Jacob sheep, a small, sturdy breed that dates to biblical times. Recently, he added two more to his flock, which he keeps in a pen in the backyard when not in service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers pay $1 per sheep per day, but Mr. Miller also accepts barter payments, which have so far included karate lessons, jugs of maple syrup and the use of one homeowner's truck. He has done around 20 homes so far, and has so many requests he can't keep up with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, who supplements his income by working on a local farm, has resisted raising his prices because he wants his services to be available to all. And while Heritage Lawn Mowing is not yet in the black, he says he has found a better way of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a gateway to that whole rural dream,'' he said. ''And with the type of recession we're having, there's stability in it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other yeoman start-ups are charting a more traditional path to profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrie Ferrence, 33, and Jacqueline Gjurgevich, 32, were in business school at Bainbridge Graduate Institute in Washington State when they noticed that many local neighborhoods were ''food deserts,'' without easy access to fresh local produce and other grocery staples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their answer was StockBox Grocers, a company that repurposes old shipping containers as small grocery stores. The company won $12,500 in a local business plan competition and raised more than $20,000 online in a Kickstarter campaign to finance its first store, which opened in the Delridge neighborhood of Seattle in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a tough job market, and you have really few instances in your life to do something that you really love,'' Ms. Ferrence said. ''It's not that this is the alternative. It's the new plan A.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of social cachet, agricultural start-ups are a long way from Silicon Valley. But the phenomenon seems to be gaining steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, a nonprofit that matches willing farmhands with organic farms seeking temporary help, has become, for the 4-H crowd, what Stanford's computer science department has been for Silicon Valley. In the last three years, membership in the group's United States branch has quadrupled, and among a certain set of college-age agriculturalists, the organization has become a verb (as in ''Did you WWOOF last summer?'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agricultural start-up world has also benefited from the growth of the sustainable business community. There are now business school programs in sustainable entrepreneurship, sustainable start-up conferences and venture capital firms that invest solely in green businesses. Even <span class="companylink">Nike</span> has gotten into the game, with a new sustainable venture fund that will allow it to ''thrive in a sustainable economy, one where people, planet and profit are in balance,'' according to the company's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OF course, the mainstreaming of farm life has inspired a certain amount of skepticism among those with more agricultural experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Stroud, 44, of Red Hook, Brooklyn, has been raising chickens since he was 19. He said he thinks many newcomers to the sustainable agriculture world are making a high-tech mountain out of a Bronze Age molehill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's simpler than one would think,'' he said of modern-day homesteading. ''Peasants with zero education were doing this hundreds of years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After his regular work, restoring high-end antiques, dried up earlier this year, Mr. Stroud began advertising his farm skills to fad-chasing urbanites: for a price, he would build them backyard chicken coops and teach them to care for the birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offer was so well received that Mr. Stroud estimates that nearly half of his income now comes from chicken consulting. He dispenses advice on a Web site called Red Hook Chicken Guy, where he lists the benefits of chicken farming in Brooklyn. (Reason No. 10: ''It's just a cool thing to do.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a good opportunity for kids who have gone to college with degrees in Hungarian literature that they owe $300,000 on,'' he said, chuckling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stroud's wife, Susan Gregory Thomas, 42, began growing food for their family when her freelance writing failed to pay the grocery bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic downturn, she said, has widened the interest in farming beyond the bio-dilettantes and the merely curious: ''It's not a movement that's going to go away. This economy has been so devastating to so many people that this idea of doing for one's self, which is very much an American idea, is taking hold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But being an agricultural entrepreneur is not without its risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Charles, a Wall Street technology manager, decided to become an urban farmer after he was laid off twice, first by <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, in 2008, and then by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, in 2009. He and a former colleague from <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, David Lowe, started EcoVeggies, a company that uses aeroponic technology to grow plants without soil. Their plan is to convert abandoned buildings in Newark into high-tech urban farms that will supply produce to local restaurants and schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reward ''is the immense satisfaction of starting from a dream and doing something,'' said Mr. Charles, 44.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he and Mr. Lowe used personal savings to finance their EgoVeggies project, and so far have failed to turn a profit. Mr. Charles, who has a day job at a renewal energy consulting firm, said he now works harder, and makes less, than he did on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Ms. Ferrence of StockBox Grocers said that although she has gotten interest from investors, the first store is still in the red, and the low margins of the grocery business mean it will probably never generate huge profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Charles put it, ''Entrepreneurship is a great idea, but it's not for everyone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who can either spare the money and the time or do without both, however, may find that going back to the land offers an appealing challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, Mr. Miller took his flock of sheep to the home of a new client, where he tied them to two stakes in the backyard and watched as they began to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacob sheep, he said, go first for broad-leaf plants, then for dandelions and clovers, and then for grass. They generally avoid flowers and other decorative growth, he added, and seem drawn to intruders like buckthorn plants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have a built-in weed whacker,'' he said, stroking the fleece of a sheep that goes by the name of Princess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller has had his setbacks. He lost one lamb to bloating earlier this year, another to parasites and a third when he gave an underperforming animal to a friend who wanted a lamb roast (''Layoffs,'' he said with a deadpan expression). Then there was the time his sheep escaped from their pen and were found hours later on a nearby street, and he was fined $50 by the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now, with winter coming, snow will probably put a crimp in his profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after seeing the results of his urban farming experiment, he said he wouldn't have done it any other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Building a new America will require an understanding of farming,'' he said. ''We have to look to the past to see the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller would like to go to graduate school to study sustainable development, and eventually wants to be the chief executive of an organic farm company. For now, though, he is looking to expand Heritage Lawn Mowing into neighboring towns, and increase the size of his flock so he can take on larger projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highways, he has been thinking, are a good place to start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's so much grass in the median strips,'' he said. ''You could feed a lot of sheep with those.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my last post, Carissa Reiniger, a member of our business group and founder of Silver Lining Limited, described the missteps that left her $410,000 in debt by early 2008. We pick up her story here, as she explained it to the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two years of trying to ignore her predicament, Ms. Reiniger was forced to acknowledge it. One wake-up call came, she said, from the husband of a creditor who went to Silver Lining's offices in Edmonton, Canada, and threatened her and her employees. Some shell-shocked employees began to quit, and Ms. Reiniger was forced to lay off others. She was soon down to two employees from a high of 25. In a misguided attempt to grow her way out of debt, Ms. Reiniger had expanded from Silver Lining's original Toronto office, adding outposts in Vancouver and Edmonton, Canada, and Las Vegas. In 2008, she decided to close all but the Toronto office.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver Lining had made its living coaching other small businesses on how to set and reach financial goals. Now, Ms. Reiniger's own business was struggling to manage its growth. The irony contributed to her reluctance to face her financial problems head-on. She wasn't sure what to do: ''I needed either slower growth or more money,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she said she believed the market for Silver Lining's services was strong. Small business owners needed help. And Ms. Reiniger said she had learned a lot since founding the company. Much of what she learned came from hundreds of interviews she conducted with business owners for a book, ''Inspiring Entrepreneurs: How to Build Your Business to Its First Million,'' that she self-published in 2008. Those lessons came too late to keep Silver Lining from falling into debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2008, she gave herself 90 days to rethink her business model. During that time, she came to the conclusion that Silver Lining must shift from consulting to something more scalable. ''I'm motivated by high-growth, and I was fighting a business model that needs a lot of money and a lot of people,'' she said. She eventually decided that providing software to help small businesses, backed up by optional add-on services like coaching, would be her best option. ''Whether I have one or 10,000 tech customers, my expenses don't increase exponentially,'' she said. Of course, it would take money to create that instructional software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, two accountants were advising Ms. Reiniger to file for bankruptcy -- advice she opposed. ''Walking away from the debt was never an option,'' she said. She was also unwilling to shut down her company. Instead, she got creative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reiniger said she cold-called Staples, <span class="companylink">Research in Motion</span> and <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> with a proposal to help them reach small-business customers. Instead of investing in hit-or-miss advertising, the corporations could buy Silver Lining's services and have Ms. Reiniger provide business owners with free, corporation-sponsored workshops. The three corporations signed on, as did two others, she said, and they paid Ms. Reiniger $125,000 to do 10 events across Canada in the fall of 2008. That sum, she said, enabled her to pay the rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She continued working with the corporations throughout 2009. ''It was like a cash cow,'' she said. Six corporations paid her a total of $360,000 to conduct events for small-business owners. By late 2009, she said, she was able to pay off all but $145,000 of her debt. She said she also resumed communication with her creditors, many of whom had been infuriated by her lack of responsiveness. Even a family friend, she said, ''was calling and threatening to send people after me.'' Another friend sued her, she said, and got a judgment against her when she ignored the lawsuit. They eventually worked out a payment plan, and Ms. Reiniger said she was in the process of repaying him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late 2010, she said she believed things were looking up. When her contracts with the corporations expired that December, she had to decide whether to renew. By this point, she said, there were nine corporations, and they were willing to pay her a total of about $1 million annually to serve as a spokeswoman, traveling up to 300 days a year. She decided to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silver Lining had become a consultant to big business about small business, she said, not a business that helps small businesses. This wasn't the company she had intended to build. She decided that she would finally take steps to transform her business from a consulting service to a technology company, a move she said she believed would make it much more profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why couldn't you work for like three of the companies and pay back more of the debt?'' asked Alexandra Mayzler, a member of the business group and the founder of Thinking Caps Tutoring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an all-or-nothing arrangement, Ms. Reiniger responded. The nine corporations had formed a consortium. They had bought into Ms. Reiniger's program together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You never tried to get a line of credit during all this?'' asked the group member Susan Parker, who owns BariJay, a dress manufacturer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this point, Ms. Reiniger said, she was dividing her time between Toronto and New York, where she planned to move the company. She said she felt that she had turned the corner in terms of paying down her debt and refining the software concept. ''I felt like there was no better place to go big than New York,'' she said. But in the United States, she had no credit history, something, she acknowledged, that was probably a good thing. Getting a loan here, she said, would require an American co-signer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the time she decided against renewing her corporate contracts, Ms. Reiniger began talks to bring in a partner to run the company. ''Clearly, I'm bad at managing what I create,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She found a partner who started acting as Silver Lining's president last December. The following month, Silver Lining began to develop its software product. Freed of the day-to-day aspects of running the business, Ms. Reiniger focused on her strengths: forming strategic partnerships with companies that would buy her software in bulk. She and her new partner also took steps to raise $1 million that would go toward repaying Silver Lining's debt, developing the software, and operating the business, which stopped generating revenue in January when it went into development mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by March, Silver Lining found itself in a familiar place. The company was out of money, and Ms. Reiniger was about to miss payroll. Additionally, she and her new partner had parted ways. She now expects her annual revenue, which had been $1.2 million, to fall to $300,000 this year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the last day of the fourth quarter in 2008, BC Krishna was trying to clinch a deal with a large, name-brand company. The transaction would have put his small start-up, Memento, a fraud-detection company, on the map. When the deal fell through, Mr. Krishna worried about how his venture capitalist investors would react -- especially because it meant that Memento was going to fall short of its performance targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Krishna found the guidance of one of his investors, Maria Cirino, invaluable largely because, he said, she had been an entrepreneur herself. Ms. Cirino is a co-founder of .406 Ventures, a venture capital firm in Boston, but before that she spent 20 years building technology businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maria had run a sales cycle before and knew it was complex,'' Mr. Krishna said. ''She had dealt with the angst of not bringing in that crucial deal, so she provided empathy and an ability to push forward. Every company goes through challenges, and the question is, How do people around the table react when that challenge comes upon us? Who's there for you? Former entrepreneurs are the most understanding, though not necessarily the most lenient.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a minority of small-business owners seek venture capital, but for those who do, it can feel like a deal with the devil. Venture-backed companies are expected to grow quickly, and their boards can impose rigorous controls, audits and metrics. A founder who takes venture capital gets the opportunity to grow but also risks losing control of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way entrepreneurs mitigate the tension in the relationship with investors is to work with venture capitalists who may have more patience during the company-building process because they have been through it themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such entrepreneurs-turned-investors have become more common recently, even as the venture capital industry contracts after years of lackluster returns. Some insiders see this as the industry righting itself after a bubble, saying venture capital has gone back to its roots now that many M.B.A.'s lured by giant paychecks have left the field. They say they believe that venture capital is once again attracting the right mix of former founders and operators who are truly passionate about nurturing companies and who have hard-won insights that can help founders succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's back to the future,'' said Kate Mitchell, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Scale Venture Partners</span> and former chairwoman of the National Venture Capital Association. ''Silicon Valley was founded by a balance of entrepreneurs and finance types. The bubble brought a huge influx of people, but the tourists have gone home and the ratio is back to normal. A lot of the new venture firms are led by former entrepreneurs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some business owners say entrepreneurs-turned-VC's are more supportive, particularly in times of trouble or when dealing with thorny issues. Mr. Krishna, a serial entrepreneur who is now president and chief executive of MineralTree, an accounts-payable security provider for small businesses that is also backed by Ms. Cirino's .406 Ventures, recalls a time when one of his male employees was insensitive to a working mother. This human resources conundrum was not a board-level issue, but if left unchecked it could have become one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I take these situations to my board members, are they going to say, 'This person is an idiot,' or be glad I'm opening up to them?'' said Mr. Krishna, who again sought advice from Ms. Cirino. ''Sometimes you need to wear your angst and emotions on your sleeve. Certain VC's might see that as a sign of weakness, but I know Maria's experience is so deep in these areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many venture capitalists, replacing founders with professional management, or at least providing adult supervision, is part of a well-established strategy to increase the value of companies in their portfolios. It is not always a last resort; sometimes it is just a question of when. ''You don't want someone who's constantly thinking, 'Should I fire this C.E.O.?' '' Ms. Cirino said. ''Unfortunately that's the relationship the majority of entrepreneurs have with their VC's. Some of that is the entrepreneur's fault, if the entrepreneur never allows the VC to gain important insight into the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Friend, who is now a managing director at Bain Capital Ventures, said his history as an entrepreneur informed the way he navigated the more difficult aspects of the relationship between founder and investor, such as structuring employment agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone wants the same thing, a successful company,'' said Mr. Friend, who sold his venture-backed company, ProfitLogic, a retail analytics consulting firm, to <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> in 2005 for $250 million and became a venture capitalist a year later. ''But when it gets down to the nuts-and-bolts specifics -- like under what circumstances founders can be removed from their position, what happens to their ownership stake, do they retain a board seat -- it's emotional. It forces you to think through a lot of negative scenarios.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Mr. Friend said, he often finds himself mediating between his portfolio companies' chief executives and other investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, some owners say entrepreneur-investors anticipate the needs of their growing businesses, putting in place infrastructure to help start-ups grow. Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box.net, a cloud content management platform, said the entrepreneur-investors at Andreesen Horowitz have resources ready when portfolio companies reach each new stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levie, for example, can use the investing firm's internal public relations and marketing experts, and when he has new jobs to fill, he consults a ''talent group'' that has a database of contacts to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, however, some pitfalls to working with entrepreneurs-turned-investors. For one, they sometimes have trouble ceding control. Successful founders are used to running the show and, as venture capitalists, they can be intrusive and overbearing. ''When you're an entrepreneur, you're a player on the field, moving the ball,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''You can directly affect the outcome. As a VC, you're a coach. You have a front row seat, but you're not on the field. That can be frustrating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former entrepreneurs may also run a greater risk of falling in love with a company and missing a strategic opportunity to sell. ''They might hold it too long -- thinking, 'If we grab one more customer or do one more acquisition...,' '' said Kelly M. Williams, a managing director who leads a group at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> that invests in venture capital funds. ''There were plenty of companies that got stranded in the 2000 bubble, companies that turned down offers because they and their VC's thought they could get more if they held out another year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, business owners, venture capitalists and limited partners all counsel entrepreneurs not to jump at any offer of capital. They say what matters most between a founder and investor is chemistry, transparency and trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though entrepreneurs think they're selling all the time, the reality is it's a dating process,'' Mr. Friend said. ''And they should be careful about the partner they pick.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute said its main business climate index for Germany improved in November to 106.6 from 106.4 in October, the first gain in four months, and a sign that the German economy ''is still performing relatively well despite the international turmoil.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With markets in New York closed for Thanksgiving, trading volume was subdued, particularly in contrast with a day earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the close of trading, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, fell 0.31 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London fell 0.24 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German 10-year bonds, which became the focus of attention on Wednesday, continued to fall in price. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 5 basis points to 2.19 percent. Portuguese 10-year bonds fell more heavily, trading to yield 11.42 percent, up 84 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell to $1.3336 from $1.3341 late Wednesday in New York, while the British pound fell to $1.5501 from $1.5555. The dollar fell to 0.9192 Swiss francs from 0.9201 francs, and to 77.11 Japanese yen from 77.31 yen.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME people who toil discontentedly in corporate cubicles regard entrepreneurship as the cure for all workplace ills. Only when they've experienced running a business personally do they find that the reality is much different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Cleary, for example, left his job as a sales and marketing executive to become an entrepreneur because he was tired of office politics. But after buying a franchise and an existing business about eight years ago, Mr. Cleary sparred with difficult vendors and suppliers. ''It seemed very one-sided, with many commitments and obligations on my part, and much less required of the people I was buying from,'' he says.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to establish trust, he says, he extended credit to a client of the previous owner. Unfortunately, he says, the client was not forthcoming with payment, costing him tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding loyal employees was no picnic, either. ''It was a harsh wake-up call,'' he says, ''to find out how many employees are not truly committed to the business they're working for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent recession was particularly hard on the revenue and cash flow of his small business. Eventually, he found himself too deeply in debt to continue, and he returned to working for an established organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he is content in his role as senior vice president for strategic marketing and field operations at the National Wild Turkey Federation in Edgefield, S.C., where he feels that he is living his personal mission to help conserve natural habitats. ''I love that I'm finally in a position to worry about the high-level strategy instead of the other stuff, which just sapped my energy,'' he says. ''It's really freeing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many prospective entrepreneurs fail to realize that office politics are everywhere, and that you can't escape them when you strike out on your own. You may still have to contend with rude clients and partners, with many situations feeling eerily similar to those of your days by the water cooler. And you often learn the hard way that people tend to clash regardless of the environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other reasons you may want to steer clear of the entrepreneurial path. First, there's the sheer difficulty of finding a market niche for your product or service, as well as the proper resources to make a new business happen. Then there are the minutiae. As the founder, you will find that anything and everything is your responsibility. You will oversee production, distribution, marketing, sales and turning a profit. You'll have to manage employees and vendors, and pesky details like accounting, taxes, insurance and licenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be entrepreneurs who want to have a better work-life balance are in for a rude awakening. For at least the first few years, you may be on the job at all hours. If a customer has a problem in the middle of the night, you are the one who's getting up to address it. And if the company goes under, you are solely accountable for that failure, sacrificing your financial livelihood in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the traditional business world gets a bad rap. But there are some highly valuable aspects of regular jobs that we don't think about until they are gone. These are the three P's: peace, prestige and perks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you are one employee out of 1,000 or 100,000, you have much more peace. It's actually possible to leave your work woes at the office and turn off your BlackBerry without jeopardizing the company's future. Life is simpler. You have a defined set of responsibilities, and if you carry them out well and get results, you can go about your business with the certainty that the rest of the company can take care of itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if you are intelligent and personable, you can rise to a respectable place in an esteemed organization. Your friends and family won't fidget nervously when you tell them about your job. Being able to put a known company on your resume equals credibility and opens career doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, don't forget about the perks. At a large organization, your compensation package is just that: a package. Besides base salary, the money your employer contributes to your health insurance and retirement plans can be essential to surviving in today's world. And don't discount the value of possible benefits like cars, gym memberships, child care, on-the-job lunches and big discounts on company products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE corporate world also gives you the opportunity to be around lots of people all the time. And, inevitably, some will be executives in a position to help with your career. The ability to establish relationships with powerful people in the context of your daily work is the best kind of networking out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurial lifestyle isn't for everyone. It wasn't for Mr. Cleary, and it may not be for you. Before you decide to take the plunge, think long and hard about what you'll be getting yourself into, and what you'll be giving up.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2008, about nine months after he bought a steel-processing business, Precision Steel Services in Warren, Mich., for some $750,000, Shailesh Kumar went to two banks in search of a $350,000 loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wanted to expand the business and pay off a $290,000 debt he had with the seller, replacing an 8 percent, seven-year debt with a 6.5 percent, 20-year loan. ''It would have made a huge difference in terms of cash flow and growth capital,'' Mr. Kumar said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both lenders he was negotiating with demanded that Mr. Kumar put up equity in his own home as collateral. Mr. Kumar hesitated, and then as 2008 wore on, he watched the value of his home fall to $330,000 from $425,000, wiping out all of his equity. Eventually, the banks broke off negotiations. With no cash on hand and revenue down by some 60 percent during the first half of 2009, Mr. Kumar closed Precision Steel in July 2009. Today, he runs an investment advice Web site, Value Stock Guide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of the housing market has highlighted how entrepreneurs are routinely compelled to bet the house on their businesses. For many, taking the risk is tempting because their home may be their largest asset and loans against home equity are easier to find than business loans. Also, such loans come at lower interest rates than most alternatives. They can also allow a business owner to avoid giving equity to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using data from Barlow Research Associates, a Minneapolis company that conducts quarterly financial surveys, Scott Shane, a professor at Case Western Reserve University, estimated that from 2001 to 2006, the percentage of small business owners who tapped their home equity for business, either by pledging their homes as collateral or by borrowing against home equity, rose to 27.5 percent from 18.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, owners have no choice. The Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program, for example, ''requires that if there is collateral available to make a fully secured loan, the bank lender has an obligation to get it as collateral,'' said Steven J. Smits, associate administrator for the office of capital access at the S.B.A. Many lenders require owners to show that they are serious by putting up cash -- often from home equity loans. ''The standard in the industry is lenders want skin in the game,'' Mr. Smits said, ''and 20 percent is a safe rule of thumb.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, however, the drop in home prices means that fewer owners have the home equity option. And while there is no way to determine the precise numbers, that drop has undoubtedly restricted the ability of owners to obtain financing to start, expand or maintain a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest problem is that revenues of the great majority of small businesses have gone down from between 10 percent and 70 percent,'' said George Cloutier, founder of American Management Services, an Orlando, Fla., consulting firm that specializes in financial turnarounds for small and midsize companies. ''In normal times, there would be a movement to use home equity to shore up losses and sagging sales. The problem that has occurred is that no one's doing home equity loans, especially on marginal cases where the owner's business is in trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some worry about the impact this inability to raise capital and start businesses and hire employees might have on the economy; others wonder whether it ever makes sense to demand this level of commitment from entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most start-ups in the U.S. economy are not suitable for venture capital finance,'' said David T. Robinson, a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. ''So it's probably the best system we've got. But it's certainly an inefficient system, because if I have a great idea but no home, and you have a lot of home equity but no ideas,'' the two sides are out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many entrepreneurs, risking the house demonstrates a passion to succeed. Zalmi Duchman, 31, took a $100,000 home equity loan on his Surfside, Fla., condo and in 2006 used $5,000 of it to start the Fresh Diet, a gourmet meal-delivery service. (He used the rest for living expenses while building the business.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 18 months later he took out an additional $200,000 to match with a $900,000 S.B.A. loan that he used to buy a competitor with operations in Miami and New York. ''I don't think I would have gotten the S.B.A. loan without my condo,'' said Mr. Duchman, who expects the Fresh Diet to bring in $30 million in revenue this year. ''I wouldn't have grown the way I did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see taking money out of the house as excessively risky. Philip Patrick, founder of PharmaStrat, a pharmaceutical consulting firm in Flemington, N.J., started his company in 2002 with $5,000 and says he has had a profit since its first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, he sold his business, which had annual revenue of $5 million, without ever having borrowed against his house. ''I think some entrepreneurs, when looking for money, pitch that as a positive: 'Look how much faith I have! I'm betting down to the last nickel!' '' he said. ''But I think that's a negative. I don't want to invest in someone who's down to the last nickel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting the house can be especially uncomfortable for the spouses and families of entrepreneurs. After Rick Sanchez lost his job at a film postproduction house in 2006, he and his wife, Tara Zucker, decided to take $55,000 from a home equity line of credit to buy equipment and start their own postproduction business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Post Haste Media of North Hollywood, Calif., did well at first, and they were able to pay off half the loan. Then, in 2008, the economy declined and they had to take out more money. ''For me, it was an exciting prospect, though it was scary,'' said Mr. Sanchez, 58. ''For my wife, it was a lot more difficult. She's a lot more conservative with money and worries a lot more about it than I do. It took a lot of working on those issues between the two of us.'' When they paid off the loan in 2010, Mr. Sanchez said, ''it was a great relief.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every loan has a happy ending. In 2001, Linda Frakes, of Cumming, Ga., decided to buy a franchise in the Curves health club chain. By 2004, she owned eight. But Curves began to fall out of favor, and in 2005, Ms. Frakes refinanced her home twice to take out $155,000 in home equity and invest it in keeping the franchises running while she tried to sell them. ''I was having trouble making payroll,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Frakes wound up selling her franchises for far less than the $150,000 to 200,000 she had expected to get for each of them. She eventually closed two locations and sold the remaining six in three sales for a total of $500,000. At the end, she was left with $80,000 in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laden with about $250,000 in business-related credit card debt on which she was paying $4,000 a month, a $3,500 mortgage payment, and little income, Ms. Frakes held on for about six months before she stopped making mortgage payments in spring 2008. She declared bankruptcy and then lost her home in late 2009. ''I explained to my son the 15-year-old's version of bankruptcy, and his only question was, 'Are we going to have enough money for food?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now 56, Ms. Frakes wrote a book about her experience and today owns Health Fairs Onsite, a company that puts on health fairs at corporate locations nationwide. It is 100 percent bootstrapped. ''I don't have any credit, you know?'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEETINGS of the leadership of A Child's Place -- a family-owned day care center, elementary school and afterschool program in northern Queens -- do not always follow an agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one meeting last winter, Linda Coles, who started the business almost 30 years ago with a few charges in her father-in-law's basement, sat at her desk pulling lettuce, tomatoes and grilled chicken out of a bag. Her husband, Gregory, the chief executive, talked with their son, Brandon, about how to handle employees who failed to log in to the new computerized payroll system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to let employees be aware that if they miss a punch, it will reduce their hours,'' Gregory told Brandon, 27, who had been struggling to step into his father's role as the finance director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Linda interrupted with another critical question: Had Brandon brought his daughter's shoes with him to work? Kalia had spent the night at her grandparents' house and clomped off to class in her rubber boots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't like her walking around in those boots all day,'' said Linda, who later cited an old wives' tale that rubber boots could be bad for the eyes. ''At 18, 19 months, she can't dictate to you ----''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your granddaughter is 23 months,'' Brandon pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Said Linda, ''She's still too young to dictate to you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as abruptly, the conversation jolted back to business: scheduling a tour for a potential program partner; whether an employee going through a family trauma should take a few days off; how best to advertise their summer camp (Brandon suggested printing on Frisbees, an idea both parents liked).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Brandon's sister, Denice Jeffries-El, who had already taken over their mother's role as educational director, called her mother on her way back from a doctor's appointment, wondering about lunch. Linda shared her plan to make a salad with the grilled chicken. ''You don't have to eat it,'' Linda said into the phone, voice rising, ''but then you don't have lunch, and you starve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a huff, she hung up. ''It doesn't sound appetizing, but she can't tell me what she wants,'' she said, putting on a jacket. ''I'm going to go to the deli and get your spoiled sister a sandwich.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Said Brandon, ''Can I have a sandwich, too, and not be spoiled?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it goes for the Coles clan, an unusually fractious yet unusually close-knit family for whom the boundaries of home and work are both permeable and in perpetual motion. They work long days and then go out to dinner, vacation together, see one another on weekends at church, swinging from fighting to laughing in an instant. That their business is about child-rearing, and that it is an enterprise facing critical transitions, only underscore the charged emotional bonds and pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda and Gregory own the business -- she has a 51 percent stake to his 49 -- and take annual salaries of about $65,000 and $55,000. Over the next five years, they expect to hand over about a quarter stake each to Denice, who currently earns $45,000, and Brandon ($35,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are other relatives in the three buildings clustered between Northern and Astoria Boulevards where East Elmhurst blends with North Corona: Linda's father and stepmother, Willie and Eileen Crawford, who contributed financing and sweat equity to the enterprise, sit on the board; Brandon's girlfriend of six years, Tamesha Davis, works as an administrator; Gregory and Linda's niece, Alaya Coles, is Denice's deputy; three of Linda's cousins also work there as teachers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of my friends say, 'You still hanging out with your parents?' '' Brandon said, laughing. ''Well, you know, they do things that I enjoy. Through work and vacation and even some nights when we're with each other until 8 o'clock, I don't complain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the affection, though, there are challenges: Linda and Gregory are trying to pull back and let the next generation take over, the point at which many family businesses fail; at the same time, they are hoping to expand and create a charter school, even as financial constraints have led some parents to withdraw their children from A Child's Place. Some weeks, money has been so tight that Linda and Gregory have held back on cashing their paychecks so that their children could cash theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a board meeting last winter, when Brandon and Denice appeared insufficiently focused on resolving an issue, Linda cried out, ''We are going to be living in a refrigerator box on the street because you all think everything is so funny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Modest Start</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like so many small businesses, A Child's Place was born out of personal need. Linda and Gregory, who grew up in the neighborhood and began dating in high school, moved in with his father a few years after he graduated in 1979 from Clemson University in South Carolina, where he was on a basketball scholarship and she studied education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda began taking Denice, then a toddler, along to a day care center where she had gotten a job, but that proved untenable. Creating A Child's Place would allow the couple to support themselves while spending time with each other and their babies, and maybe to leave something for their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory, now 55, who had studied business and worked as an industrial engineer, recalled, ''I felt that working for myself, I would be more dedicated to get things done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Linda, 54, it was a way to address the working-mother dilemma. ''They would be on cots over here, and we would be right over there,'' she said, indicating two sides of a small office, ''planning things and doing the checks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business quickly outgrew the elder Mr. Coles's basement, moving in 1985 to a storefront on Northern Boulevard, and then expanding to another space on Astoria Boulevard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998 -- after both Gregory's father and Linda's parents mortgaged their houses and the couple secured financing from nonprofit lenders -- they bought a large lot on 108th Street for about $300,000 and spent $2.5 million building the squat, three-story structure made of stucco and brick that now houses the preschool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the company serves about 300 children -- including Brandon's 2-year-old daughter, Kalia; Denice's 7-year-old son, Jaylen; and her 18-month-old daughter, DiLynn. There are 136 infants and toddlers, whose parents pay up to $765 a month for day care, and about 110 children enrolled in kindergarten through third grade, at a cost of at least $470 per month. A Child's Place also offers an afterschool program that serves about 90 children, about 40 of whom go to other schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandon, who graduated from Delaware State University in 2007 with a degree in business management, had worked for his parents during high school, helping with the bus service the school used to run, but at first he resisted returning as an adult. He worked at a <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> store in Delaware for a few months, but he rejoined A Child's Place as a financial supervisor. He now lives with Ms. Davis and their daughter a few blocks from the school, across the street from his parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a choice -- it's all you know,'' he said of his decision to come back. Growing up, ''if I wasn't playing basketball or going to school, I was at A Child's Place,'' he explained, adding, ''And my parents are so community-oriented, everyone else knows you as A Child's Place, so you're kind of like a walking brand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denice, 31, who also began working at the school as a teenager, moved to Maryland for college but transferred in 2000 to St. John's University in Queens. There, she studied business and education and met her husband, Jabbar Jeffries-El, now a food and beverage manager at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square. They bought a house on a quiet street in Englewood, N.J., where, Denice said, she doesn't have to talk about A Child's Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeffries-El said he, too, hoped to start a business of his own someday. He has plans for a partnership with his brother but would shy away from employing relatives, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's tough to have to discipline this person and then go spend Thanksgiving Day with them,'' he said. ''Ultimately, business and family don't always mix.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Control</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My brother's personality is really something else,'' Denice said as she steered her Hyundai Sonata across the George Washington Bridge one morning last spring. ''He can annoy me extremely quickly, but he's extremely bright.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandon always had great ideas, she said, but was not as good on the follow-through. Knowing they would eventually be partners, she had been urging him to show more dedication to the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been trying to help him understand the responsibilities,'' Denice said. ''I try to explain to him, 'To whom much is given, much is expected.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was about 8 a.m., and Denice had already done much. With her husband having left for work shortly before 7, she was upstairs adorning DiLynn's ponytails with tiny clips, so Jaylen welcomed a reporter inside their spacious home, which overlooks the park where he plays baseball. Clutching her cellphone and purse and planning to pick up a bagel at some point, Denice piled them into the car for the 30-minute drive to Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several hours later, still with no bagel, she headed for a doctor's appointment on Long Island, a now-routine visit for treating breast cancer; she received the diagnosis last year. ''They think I started getting it because of the hormones when I was pregnant with my son,'' she said matter-of-factly. Not planning to have more children, she opted for a double mastectomy. ''I was like, 'Listen, I don't need them; I don't use them for anything,' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also underwent a yearlong round of chemotherapy and a series of reconstructive surgeries. She is open about the experience but said she was surprised at how deeply it reverberated through A Child's Place after she wrote a letter about her illness to the 85-member staff, prompting many tears. Linda said it brought the group closer, as women shared stories of themselves or loved ones having the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of those bonds, though, Denice said she dreamed of moving to Florida, away from the cold, and running A Child's Place from afar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My brother's got cameras everywhere,'' she noted, referring to the robust surveillance system, called Peace of Mind, which allows parents to see remotely what is going on throughout the center. ''It's like a jail, but the way he has it set up I can log on with my phone and see what's going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one really believes she could go through with a move, though: she would miss the family too much, and she would have difficulty letting go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it is, Denice never feels that she is doing enough to grow and nurture the business. At a meeting last winter, she told the board -- her family -- that she needed to spend more time at the school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have to get my halls together,'' she said. ''I have to make sure my teachers are in line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Crawford, Linda's stepmother, began, ''Well you have people in place ---- ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not about having people in place; it's about me being in place,'' Denice shot back. ''Nobody can do what I do but me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fault Lines</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Monday before Easter, Brandon was behind the wheel of his Ford Flex, running errands before meeting his parents, with plans to bring up an issue that had been on his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tension had been developing between Ms. Davis, his girlfriend, and Alaya, his cousin, in part because of complications of the family relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaya and Denice grew up together and can communicate with nothing more than a look. At moments they are simply Alaya and Denice, cousins and friends, Brandon said, but they also need to be Miss Alaya and Miss Denice, the office professionals in charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Brandon's girlfriend and the mother of his child, Ms. Davis had constant access to the institution's higher-ups, and the staff was beginning to look to her for leadership, sometimes in areas that were not her territory but Alaya's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's brought a lot of new ideas, a lot of things that being in the family, being there every day, you may overlook because you're there all the time,'' Brandon said that morning. ''She's very driven, so when she's at A Child's Place, she's very much Miss Tamesha, and that's good because she knows where to draw the line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a line that everyone in the family seems to struggle with at times. At a surprise birthday party for Linda at her house last month, the conversation moved from Linda and Gregory's recent Caribbean cruise to whether Brandon could get out of work at the end of the week to go bowling with his grandfather, and then changed again to Brandon's desire for a motorcycle. Linda asked Ms. Davis how she felt about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're in the hot seat now, girl,'' Denice said, laughing. ''Answer the question.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at Linda, Ms. Davis began, ''Well, I told him, you're in a different place right now ----''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jovially, Denice cut her off: ''She asked what you thought, not what you said.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a moment, Ms. Davis started again, telegraphing, more than stating, her worry: ''I told him, it's not so much you driving but how other people behave when they're driving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandon, not getting the full-throated support that he was after, began, ''Ah, Miss Tamesha.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She shot back, ''I am not Miss Tamesha right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passing the Torch</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Election Day, A Child's Place was closed to students, while the staff had career development workshops. Gregory met with the food service workers in the basement of the preschool building. Linda was home, finishing up the fried chicken, baked ham, macaroni and cheese, pot roast, cakes and pies she had made to feed the staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstairs at the center, teachers were watching videos of themselves interacting with their charges, and then filling out questionnaires that would form the basis of group critiques later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandon was in the front office, where he had recently added more of his diplomas, honors and certificates to join those of his parents and sister on the walls. Moving from computer to computer, where teams of teachers were watching the video feeds, he was trying to sort out technical glitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denice was, as usual, running between the two main buildings, meeting with supervisors, rallying teachers, checking in with Brandon about how things were going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a few days after the surprise party for Linda, and she and Gregory were feeling more comfortable about the coming transition. Brandon had just handled the twice-monthly $90,000 payroll on his own for the first time. He and Denice were beginning to act like true partners.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Lee Redden, 26, a Ph.D. student in engineering at Stanford, recently decided to shelve his education and help found a start-up company. His skills lie in a couple of red-hot niches of artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning. Yet he is not applying his talents to Internet search, online commerce or intelligence surveillance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Redden's ambitions are further afield -- in farm fields, actually. His company, Blue River Technology, is developing a robotic weed killer for organic farms, which shun chemical pesticides. The new venture, he said, is ''a great way to bring this technology to agriculture.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up here points to the latest stage of evolution in Silicon Valley, the world's epicenter of innovation. Over the years, the region has shown an unmatched economic dexterity in jumping from one industry of opportunity to another, from military electronics to silicon wafers to personal computers to the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the business of the Valley today is less about focusing on a particular industry than it is about a continuous process of innovation with technology, across a widening swath of fields. The trend reflects the steady march of that most protean of technologies -- computing -- as it makes further inroads into every scientific discipline and industry. Clean technology, bioengineering, medical diagnostics, preventive health care, transportation and even agriculture are part of the mix these days for the Valley's technologists and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of discovery has quickened, not only for technologies but also for the process of finding out what companies will succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's different in the Valley is that we've found a quasi-scientific method for reinventing businesses and industries, not just products,'' said Randy Komisar, a partner in a leading venture capital firm, <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, and a lecturer on entrepreneurship at Stanford University. ''The approach is much more systematic than it was several years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newer model for starting businesses relies on hypothesis, experiment and testing in the marketplace, from the day a company is founded. That is a sharp break with the traditional approach of drawing up a business plan, setting financial targets, building a finished product and then rolling out the business and hoping to succeed. It was time-consuming and costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preferred formula today is often called the ''lean start-up.'' Its foremost proponents include Eric Ries, an engineer, entrepreneur and author who coined the term and is now an entrepreneur in residence at the Harvard Business School, and Steven Blank, a serial entrepreneur, author and lecturer at Stanford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach emphasizes quickly developing ''minimum viable products,'' low-cost versions that are shown to customers for reaction, and then improved. Flexibility is the other hallmark. Test business models and ideas, and ruthlessly cull failures and move on to Plan B, Plan C, Plan D and so on -- ''pivoting,'' as the process is known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Science Foundation is betting on the new model to improve the rate of commercialization of the university research it finances. In October, the foundation announced the first series of grants for what it calls the N.S.F. Innovation Corps. The 21 three-member teams selected from across the country will receive $50,000 each for six months to test whether their inventions are marketable. It begins with a swing through Stanford and courses taught by Mr. Blank and others, followed by online classes and mentoring. Each team is expected to constantly test its ideas and products with customers, to experiment again and again, adhering to the lean start-up formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all about how to apply the scientific method to market-opportunity identification,'' said Errol B. Arkilic, a program manager at the foundation. ''And that is exactly why this method is the one the N.S.F. selected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Arkilic, who worked for seven years as an engineer at start-ups in the Valley before joining the government, says that the foundation plans to award 15 or 20 Innovation Corps grants every quarter. ''We can't replicate Silicon Valley elsewhere,'' he said. ''But we need to figure out a way to take some of the best practices in Silicon Valley and deploy them elsewhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Valley's lean start-up model is influencing mainstream business education. At business schools, courses on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial management have been around for years. But this spring, the 900 first-year students at the Harvard Business School must start a business as a required course. In teams of six students each, they will be given $3,000 and told to create a start-up that pulls in revenue by the end of the semester, explained Thomas R. Eisenmann, a professor who will oversee the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Eisenmann is also a leader of a Silicon Valley immersion program that takes dozens of students there each year for a firsthand look at not only the practices but also the culture of the entrepreneurial hothouse. ''Everybody is involved in a start-up,'' Dr. Eisenmann observed. ''It's assumed to be normal behavior, the cool thing to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up culture, to be sure, owes much to the Valley's history and the enduring influence of its defining personalities, like Frederick E. Terman. A longtime engineering professor at Stanford who was provost in the 1950s and 1960s, Dr. Terman encouraged his star students to put their ideas to work by starting their own companies. Among them were Bill Hewlett and David Packard, who founded <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> in 1939. Dr. Terman often invested his own money in such start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His message was that starting a company was every bit as important as getting your Ph.D.,'' said Mr. Blank, who lectures at Stanford. ''That was heresy in academia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most start-ups fail. More than perhaps anyplace else, the Valley's investors and technologists tend to view failure with a certain scientific objectivity, as if setbacks are heuristic tools leading to further research and discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over 70 years, this Valley has developed a culture that does not personalize failure,'' said Mr. Komisar, of <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span>. ''If you're not corrupt, stupid or lazy, we see failure as learning -- learn from it, and reapply it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That risk-taking and perpetual learning culture is now being applied far beyond computer hardware and software. There are high-profile ventures like Nest Labs, founded by Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive, which has hired more than 100 engineers from Apple, <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and other high-tech companies, and it is backed by a pack of venture capital firms. Its product, introduced in late October, is a reinvention of the thermostat, combining sensors, machine learning and Web technology in a clever, energy-saving device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Valley is filled with other, less-prominent start-ups in new fields, including Blue River Technology. Mr. Redden met his fellow founder and the start-up's chief executive, Jorge Heraud, 41, in Mr. Blank's class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heraud, an engineer, had decided to return to Stanford to refresh his career, after working for years as a manager for an agriculture equipment company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He met up with Mr. Redden, and they jointly recognized the opportunity for applying computer vision and machine learning to agriculture. They explored other ideas, but after talking to potential customers, they settled on killing weeds for organic farming -- a fast-growing industry that cannot use pesticides and struggles with labor costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their office in Sunnyvale, they are assembling the machine and training the computer-vision software to distinguish lettuce plants from weeds. Initially, they experimented with laser blasts to kill the weeds, but that proved too costly. Now they plan to use superheated oil (organic, of course).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their contraption, pulled behind a tractor, must identify weeds and kill them within 200 milliseconds, a formidable but attainable challenge, Mr. Redden says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If applying computer vision to agriculture is so promising, why are the big farm equipment companies not well ahead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This isn't on their radar screen,'' Mr. Heraud replied. ''They aren't putting their heads into computer vision. That's a Silicon Valley technology.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rajat Suri was excelling at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> when he dropped out and became a waiter -- not the typical direct path to fame and fortune in the technology industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then Mr. Suri took his restaurant and technology expertise to Palo Alto, raised three rounds of venture capital, including $4 million from the founders of <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>, and took a seat at the increasingly crowded table of entrepreneurs mixing technology with food.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suri used his time as a waiter to study restaurant inefficiencies and to devise technological solutions. The result: his company, E la Carte, and an iPad-like tablet called Presto that allows diners to order and pay at their tables without server interaction and play games while they wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E la Carte is one of several similar start-ups in Silicon Valley. There are dozens of Bay Area entrepreneurs hoping to find success at the intersection of eating and technology, and there are dozens of venture capital companies providing them with millions of dollars in early-stage investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many food-tech start-ups in the area, some observers, including the entrepreneurs themselves, wonder how the companies can stand out and earn money. Some also ask if this lofty food-venture souffle is in danger of collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent crowded meeting of the Bay Area networking group Foodstartups, the moderator started a panel discussion by listing tech start-ups that begin with the word ''food.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's Foodbuzz, Foodcaching, Foodia, Foodily, Foodista, Foodler, Foodoro, Foodspotting, Foodtree, Fooducopia, and Foodzie,'' said Wade Roush, a local tech journalist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc St. Raymond, founder of HeardAbout?, said, ''With so many companies out there competing for the same basic market, it's difficult to get heard above all the noise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HeardAbout?, based in San Francisco, went online earlier this year with a split focus: reviews of restaurant dishes from well-known food writers and chefs, combined with special discounts. But largely due to the glut of restaurant-deal sites, Mr. St. Raymond said he was shifting his focus away from the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Wang started Munch on Me in February, offering deals on individual restaurant dishes. He likened his concept to the weekly specials many restaurants feature on their menu boards, but with a bigger reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wang has had some success, particularly among undergraduates at the University of California, Berkeley, but ''it hasn't been too easy finding investors,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though we're doing well,'' he said, ''they look at my company and think I'm just another <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foodspotting enables users to post photos and short reviews of their favorite restaurant dishes. Unlike the crowd-sourced reviews of Yelp, also a San Francisco company, Foodspotting's reviews focus on individual dishes instead of entire restaurants. It started in January 2010 before the market grew crowded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are only so many ways that food can be explored through technology,'' said Alexa Andrzejewski, Foodspotting's founder. ''The opportunities are finite.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foodspotting recently raised $3 million in venture financing, but Ms. Andrzejewski said she was still uncertain how to make a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know,'' she said. ''Maybe we'll partner with restaurants to give them access to, say, lists of people who love bacon. At this point we're just trying to grow. We don't have a set plan for how to become self-sustaining.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suri, creator of the Presto, has a clearer idea of his business model, but, he said, his challenge is in convincing restaurants of its potential value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm asking restaurants to change their entire way of serving customers,'' he said, ''but most of them haven't heard of anything like the Presto. I'd actually welcome some competition, so this type of thing would become more mainstream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foodzie, another start-up, is whipping up a niche online marketplace for small-batch artisan foodstuffs. Foodoro provides a similar service, but Rob LaFave, its founder, said his company had a six-month head start and had ''a distinct advantage from being the first one on the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the first, he said, ''everyone remembers your name.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the start-ups try to identify with better-known names. Foodspotting promotes itself as the ''Pandora of food,'' a reference to the music application that suggests songs based on user preferences. Foodzie calls itself the ''Etsy of food,'' a reference to the online market for homemade handicrafts. And at least three Bay Area start-ups, Grubly, Housefed and Tableslice, have used the catchphrase the ''AirBnB of food.'' AirBnB is an online service that enables travelers to rent rooms from private individuals, instead of booking a hotel room. The food-related AirBnBs offer meals cooked in a stranger's home for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housefed folded in September, after six months in operation. Grubly is currently re-evaluating the viability of its model. Tableslice is in beta testing, with an official start planned soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Wise, founder of Tableslice, said heavy competition had led him to be cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've watched how these other companies have launched without a way to be self-sustaining and viable in the long-term,'' Mr. Wise said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only a week to go before Congress adjourns for the holidays, Congress has yet to renew federal unemployment benefits or the payroll tax cut that will expire at year-end. Unfortunately, Republican leaders seem far more interested in advancing their partisan aims than helping millions of struggling American families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House leadership weighed in on Thursday with a particularly bad proposal. It would extend the current payroll tax cut but gradually reduce the duration of unemployment benefits. And it proposes to pay for both with changes to social spending programs and by freezing pay for federal workers. The bill is also larded up with deplorable amendments, including one that would weaken clean air rules and another that would rush ahead with a potentially dangerous oil sands pipeline from Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Senate, the debate has focused on how to pay for a renewal of the payroll tax cut. Democrats want a surtax on incomes over $1 million a year. Republican leaders, wrapping themselves in a populist mantle, claim the surcharge would hurt small businesses and the economy since small businesses are ''job creators.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows that a mere 1 percent of small business owners make more than $1 million per year. Only about 5.4 million of the nation's 20 million small businesses pay any wages at all. The Republican claim about wealthy small business job creators, it turns out, is based on a convenient and overly broad definition of ''small'' that includes partnerships and S-corporations, like hedge funds, accounting firms, law practices and other often big businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when they claim to be protecting small business from high-end taxes, Republicans are really talking about protecting big companies whose owners fall into the one-half of 1 percent of taxpayers who are millionaires or better. A surtax would certainly not hurt them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest Democratic bill to cut the payroll tax, blocked by Republicans on Thursday, called for a 1.9 percent surtax on income over $1 million. More important, for any savvy business owner, a surtax would have no bearing on hiring decisions. If new workers are profitable before tax, they will be profitable after tax, even if the employer has to pay slightly more of the profit in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the real world of small businesses -- start-ups, corner stores, Main Street, small companies in large supply chains -- a surtax on high earners that pays for a payroll tax cut would be helpful because that tax cut would put more spending money in customers' pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Republicans have now blocked two Democratic versions of the payroll tax cut/millionaires' surtax. A new proposal by Claire McCaskill, a Democrat of Missouri, and Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, would extend the payroll tax cut and impose a millionaires' surtax, but include an exemption for some small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal is supposed to get Republicans on board. But implying that any small business exemption is needed only amplifies the false claim that small businesses are harmed by taxes on the rich. Unless very narrowly tailored, any small business exemption could all too easily become another loophole for the wealthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress should pass clean extensions of both unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut. Based on the facts, as opposed to the rhetoric, a millionaires' surtax is a reasonable way to offset some of the cost.</p>

Last week, the implicit seemingly became explicit when Amazon began a promotion that encouraged customers to check out prices at local retailers and use a specially designed ''Price Check'' smartphone app to report what they found back to Amazon. Customers who then purchased the same item from Amazon received a 5 percent discount, up to $5. (The deal was available only from Friday night through Saturday, and only for certain kinds of products.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its initiative, Amazon has been greeted with a barrage of rotten tomatoes, from the press and from small businesses and their sympathizers. (Gawker, for one, described it as ''a Christmas attack on local shops'' and a ''cheap, sad thing.'') On Thursday, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, the top Republican on the Small Business Committee, joined the fray. ''Incentivizing consumers to spy on local shops is a bridge too far,'' she said in a statement. ''During the busiest shopping season of the year, we should remember that our local restaurants, bookshops and hardware stores are the economic engines in our communities.'' Ms. Snowe urged Amazon to cancel the promotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, stores have long encouraged shoppers to snoop on competitors, and rewarded them for doing so. Amazon has just found an extraordinarily efficient way, one befitting its behemoth status, to do it. And shoppers, for their part, hardly need an app to exploit Main Street businesses; in fact, a recent study found that nearly 40 percent of book buyers on Amazon window-shopped at a bookstore first. (My colleague Jay Goltz recently wrote about consumers who take a shopkeeper's time and then brag about going home to buy the same item online.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Amazon's promotion does seem tone-deaf, considering the mood of the times. The idea that small businesses are both valuable and vulnerable, battered by an economic crisis that was not of their making, seems to have won the public's sympathy, in theory if not always in practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Amazon in particular seems to be on the wrong end of public opinion - as measured by editorials and columns in local newspapers across the country - in its battle against states seeking to collect sales tax on online purchases made by their residents. (Under current law, retailers have to collect the tax only in states where they have a substantial presence, known as nexus; otherwise customers are supposed to pay it.) Amazon's opponents - led, paradoxically, by retail giants like <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> and <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> - have successfully framed the issue as a battle between cyberspace and Main Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an Amazon spokeswoman, Sally Fouts, said in an e-mailed statement that the promotion was not directed toward small competitors. Instead, she said, it was ''primarily intended for customers who are comparing prices in major retail chain stores.'' She added that Amazon's third-party sellers - ''more than two million individuals and businesses of all sizes that sell on Amazon'' - also benefit from the Price Check app.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Amazon appears to be conceding, gradually, in the sales tax fight, a shift that at least in part may have something to do with the fact that as it expands, it is establishing a physical presence in more and more states. The company will begin collecting sales tax in California next year, instead of fighting a new state law aimed at forcing the company to do just that. In Tennessee, where the retailer is opening two new distribution centers, Amazon has agreed to begin collecting sales tax in 2014. Initially, it had sought an exemption from state tax rules. In South Carolina, where Amazon is building another distribution center, it will collect taxes in 2016. This fall, it came out in support of new bills in Congress that would allow states to collect sales taxes from online sellers that do not have a presence in those states. (Another Amazon spokesman, Ty Rogers, said by e-mail that the company had long supported ''a national approach to sales tax.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, Ms. Snowe, who spoke out so forcefully against Amazon's promotion, has not signed on to the leading Senate sales tax bill, the Marketplace Fairness Act, although Amazon itself has. ''I am absolutely committed to protecting small businesses and keeping Main Street positioned to flourish once again, and I am carefully examining these and other legislative proposals on this issue,'' Ms. Snowe said in a statement provided by a spokesman. But, she said, ''the need for comprehensive tax reform also must be considered, since the current overall tax system is its own source of problems for small businesses.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005 Carlos Ruiz lost part of a thumb when it was caught in machinery at Little Village Car Wash, where he had worked since coming to Chicago from Mexico City in 2000. After the accident, he moved to washing cars by hand, and for six years he worked 12-hour shifts three days a week, earning about $40 a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-workers reported similar pay: Only tips and a small fee per car.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could be $60 a day, or it could be $30 or $20, for 12 hours,'' said Martin Montoya, 28, a former co-worker who came to Chicago from Tijuana two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wages Mr. Montoya and Mr. Ruiz, 32, say they earned are well below the Illinois minimum of $8.25 an hour, which has led Arise Chicago, advocates for workers' rights, to organize protests. At one last month, protesters descended on Little Village Car Wash brandishing squeegees and asserting that workers were owed tens of thousands of dollars in back pay. The car wash's owner did not return phone calls, and a manager on the premises declined to talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, advocates and government officials have filed high-profile charges of labor law violations against major companies operating big-box stores, slaughterhouses and warehouses. But according to several academic studies and workers' rights groups, small businesses like car washes, diners, corner grocery stores and neighborhood butchers may be more likely than large employers to underpay workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2008 study of 4,387 low-wage workers in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles found that 82 percent of people who worked more than 40 hours a week at businesses with fewer than 100 employees were not paid all overtime due. At large employers, the number was 52 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, led by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of California at Los Angeles and Cornell University, also found that 28 percent of workers at smaller businesses earned less than the minimum wage, compared with 15 percent of workers at larger ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omar Duque, president and chief executive of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said small businesses faced less scrutiny than large corporations. ''I can definitely see how and why small, family-owned, community-based businesses might be more inclined to try to skirt some labor laws,'' Mr. Duque said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nik Theodore, director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an author of the study, said business owners often rationalized underpayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The employers see themselves as being good Samaritans rather than someone who's violating laws -- they say he's a recent immigrant so he's lucky to have a job,'' Mr. Theodore said. ''There are also cases where they know exactly what they're doing, and they are looking through co-ethnic networks for people who are exploitable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Illinois Department of Labor has 23 investigators assigned to payment violations and ''diligently investigates any complaint it receives,'' said Anjali Julka, a department spokeswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates say it can take months for action from the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proving charges against small businesses, which lack the sophisticated record keeping of large companies, can be difficult. Many small companies settle labor-law complaints out of court rather than engage in an expensive fight against an increasingly well-organized opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the decision facing John Poulos, manager of the Phoenix Restaurant in Norridge, when Manuel Luz, a bus boy, said he was owed thousands of dollars in unpaid overtime from his seven-year tenure at the restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luz said he worked 48 hours a week, Monday through Saturday, but he lacks the records to prove his case. Jamie Hayes, an Arise Chicago organizer, said the company bore responsibility for keeping work records. Mr. Poulos said the timecards he did have on file show that Mr. Luz worked only a handful of Saturdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poulos said the owner agreed to pay $2,500 to Mr. Luz to avoid stress on the owner, an 82-year-old Greek immigrant in poor health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This restaurant has been in business for 21 years, and that's the first complaint we've ever had,'' Mr. Poulos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luz, he said, was ''brainwashed'' by advocates with Arise Chicago and his church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luz said the $2,500 payment satisfied his complaint.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks surged on Tuesday, partly a result of positive economic data on the housing sector in the United States and brighter signals from the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the markets were helped by a successful auction of three-month bills in Spain. Also, a report showing improved business sentiment in Germany, Europe's largest economy, offered a glimmer of hope.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average turned positive for the month and bank shares were up more than 3 percent. Over all, it was a reversal of the drag on the entire stock market on Monday, when financial stocks fell by more than 2 percent, partly as focus shifted to a warning by the European Central Bank of a perilous year ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with no stunning news event or resolution to the financial markets' persistent irritants, some questioned the reasons behind the size of the surge on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I cannot explain today's action in the market,'' Gary M. Flam, an equity portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors, said in the final hour of trading. ''There has been no news, either positive or negative, to drive a move of this magnitude. I could try to explain it away, but a move of this magnitude is head-scratching.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 337.32 points, or 2.9 percent, at 12,103.58. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index showed a gain of nearly 3 percent to 1,241.30. The index's 35.95 point gain was the seventh-best of this year. The Nasdaq composite index was up 80.59 points, or 3.2 percent, at 2,603.73.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As stocks soared, investors left the safety of government bonds. The Treasury's 10-year note tumbled 1 2/32, to 100 21/32. The yield rose to 1.93 percent, from 1.81 percent late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts also noted that wild swings were a predictable feature of the end of the year as managers balanced underperforming elements in their portfolios at a time of low trading volume. And even after an impasse over extending a payroll tax cut was announced Tuesday in Washington, the markets held on to their gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market just seems to have no memory from one day to the next,'' Mr. Flam said. ''To drive a move of this magnitude, you would expect there to be some sort of resolution on the bigger-picture issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and the prospects of sluggish economic growth have ganged up on the financial markets in recent months. But the data has sometimes broken through the gloom, pointing to a recovery that is sluggish but at least is not stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday in the United States, government data showed that housing starts in November hit their highest level since April 2010. They reached 685,000, a seasonally adjusted annualized pace surpassing forecasts of 635,000 and up more than 9 percent compared with October. Building permits also exceeded expectations, reaching 681,000, data from the Commerce Department showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a survey released on Tuesday by the Ifo research group in Munich showed that the business climate for trade and industry in Germany, which is Europe's largest economy, continued to improve in December. ''The German economy seems to be successfully countering the downturn in Western Europe,'' the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanley Nabi, the chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that the economic reports in the United States and from Europe showed they were ''not doing as badly as expected, and this morning the housing data came out much stronger than expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to recent higher expectations for growth, he said, ''all of these things combined have given a measure of comfort'' to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed 2.7 percent higher. The major indexes were up 3.1 percent in Germany, 2.7 percent in France and 1 percent in Britain. The German 10-year bond rose 8 basis points to yield 1.95 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the euro zone bond market, where sovereign debt concerns have been overriding, the Spanish auction of three-month bills priced to yield 1.74 percent helped sentiment, an analyst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still a long way from a fix to Europe's problems, but any ease in funding pressures among member economies is certainly a welcomed development,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at <span class="companylink">Morgan Keegan &amp; Company</span>, referring specifically to Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the euro rose and the United States dollar retreated about 0.5 percent on its index, energy and materials stocks on the broader market surged nearly 4 percent. Oil prices rose more than 3.5 percent, with crude for January delivery on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span> at $97.35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> shares, which closed below $5 on Monday, their lowest point since March 2009, were up 3.7 percent Tuesday at $5.17.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> was up more than 1.3 percent to $29.12. It announced after the markets closed on Monday that it would end its bid to acquire <span class="companylink">T-Mobile USA</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The members of the Obama administration have many fine talents, but making adept historical analogies may not be among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the administration came to office in the depths of the financial crisis, many of its leading figures concluded that the moment was analogous to the Great Depression. They read books about the New Deal and sought to learn from F.D.R.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, in the 1930s, people genuinely looked to government to ease their fears and restore their confidence. Today, Americans are more likely to fear government than be reassured by it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a Gallup survey, 64 percent of Americans polled said they believed that big government is the biggest threat to the country. Only 26 percent believed that big business is the biggest threat. As a result, the public has reacted to Obama's activism with fear and anxiety. The Democrats lost 63 House seats in the 2010 elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the administration have now dropped the New Deal parallels. But they have started making analogies between this era and the progressive era around the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, there are superficial similarities. Then, as now, we are seeing great concentrations of wealth, especially at the top. Then, as now, the professional class of lawyers, teachers and journalists seems to feel as if it has the upper hand in its status war against the business class of executives and financiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these superficial similarities are outweighed by vast differences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the underlying economic situations are very different. A century ago, the American economy was a vibrant jobs machine. Industrialization was volatile and cruel, but it produced millions of new jobs, sucking labor in from the countryside and from overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's economy is not a jobs machine and lacks that bursting vibrancy. The rate of new business start-ups was declining even before the 2008 financial crisis. Companies are finding that they can get by with fewer workers. As President Obama has observed, factories that used to employ 1,000 workers can now be even more productive with less than 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the information economy widens inequality for deep and varied reasons that were unknown a century ago. Inequality is growing in nearly every developed country. According to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, over the past 30 years, inequality in Sweden, Germany, Israel, Finland and New Zealand has grown as fast or faster than inequality in the United States, even though these countries have very different welfare systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the progressive era, the economy was in its adolescence and the task was to control it. Today the economy is middle-aged; the task is to rejuvenate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the governmental challenge is very different today than it was in the progressive era. Back then, government was small and there were few worker safety regulations. The problem was a lack of institutions. Today, government is large, and there is a thicket of regulations, torts and legal encumbrances. The problem is not a lack of institutions; it's a lack of institutional effectiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States spends far more on education than any other nation, with paltry results. It spends far more on health care, again, with paltry results. It spends so much on poverty programs that if we just took that money and handed poor people checks, we would virtually eliminate poverty overnight. In the progressive era, the task was to build programs; today the task is to reform existing ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, the moral culture of the nation is very different. The progressive era still had a Victorian culture, with its rectitude and restrictions. Back then, there was a moral horror at the thought of debt. No matter how bad the economic problems became, progressive-era politicians did not impose huge debt burdens on their children. That ethos is clearly gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the progressive era, there was an understanding that men who impregnated women should marry them. It didn't always work in practice, but that was the strong social norm. Today, that norm has dissolved. Forty percent of American children are born out of wedlock. This sentences the U.S. to another generation of widening inequality and slower human capital development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hundred years ago, we had libertarian economics but conservative values. Today we have oligarchic economics and libertarian moral values -- a bad combination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In sum, in the progressive era, the country was young and vibrant. The job was to impose economic order. Today, the country is middle-aged but self-indulgent. Bad habits have accumulated. Interest groups have emerged to protect the status quo.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been another tough year for many small businesses. One in four, according to the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, believes the biggest problem is weak sales. No matter what other challenges they face, said William Dunkelberg, the federation's chief economist, ''the key to everything is cash coming in the front door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inevitably there are businesses, like the Elizabeth Anne Bed &amp; Breakfast in Crested Butte, Colo., that struggled. And inevitably, there are owners, like Kevin and Denise Reinert of Elizabeth Anne, who held on as long as they could. ''We kept thinking we could turn it around,'' Ms. Reinert said. ''We rented out rooms until the day we moved out.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are the stories of five small businesses that were not able to survive 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Poorly Timed Refinancing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elizabeth Anne Bed &amp; Breakfast was bought in 2003 for $650,000 and closed last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK After buying the Elizabeth Anne, the Reinerts steadily increased revenue, from $78,000 in 2004 to $104,000 in 2007. ''We got to know the guests,'' Mr. Reinert said, ''and they got to know each other.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG In 2007, the couple refinanced, taking out some equity to renovate the kitchen. They wound up with a 10-year, interest-only loan that increased their mortgage payment by $1,700 a month. But with people taking fewer vacations, Mr. Reinert said, revenue declined 21 percent in 2009. In 2010, they fell behind on their mortgage payments and were not able to modify the loan. The bank foreclosed in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK Ms. Reinert blames the refinancing: ''It's what did us in. Back then, we didn't anticipate things slowing down.'' Today, the Reinerts run KR Construction, which does handyman jobs. Ms. Reinert also works at a local restaurant, and Mr. Reinert plays bass in a Beatles tribute band, Dr. Robert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We Did Everything Right'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just Moulding, based in Gaithersburg, Md., sold and installed decorative molding. It opened in 2004 and closed last April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK Mark Rubin and Kevin Wales started with a single workshop that handled small jobs larger installers did not want. In 2007 things were going so well they decided to sell franchises in the business and raised $700,000 from 21 investors. After Mr. Wales left the company in 2010, Mr. Rubin's father-in-law, Richard Hayman, took over as president. Soon after, sales increased by 20 percent and the company became profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG The recession. The company, Mr. Hayman said, sold a product that people wanted but did not need: ''It was crown molding, not a furnace or a roof.'' And while the business had the high legal and accounting costs associated with selling franchises, it had sold only three by the end of 2009. Potential franchisees had trouble raising the $100,000 to $250,000 needed to get started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK ''We did everything right,'' said Mr. Hayman, who sank $470,000 into the company. ''We hired the best people and had a great product. We could not overcome the bad economy.'' He and Mr. Rubin declined to discuss what they are doing now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When 1% Is a Lot of Money</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P &amp; H Capital, a commercial mortgage company in Brooklyn that specialized in finding loans for small businesses, opened in 2009 and closed last March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK Shawn Porat and Ismail Humet started P &amp; H Capital with $4,000 while Mr. Humet was working as a Wall Street analyst and Mr. Porat was running Recovery of Judgment, which helps clients collect legal judgments. The friends saw the subprime crisis and tightening of credit as an opportunity, believing they could match small businesses with lenders offering alternative financing. In January 2010, Mr. Humet and Mr. Porat were piecing together a $500 million deal that they believed had a good chance of working. ''Our commission was 1 percent,'' Mr. Humet said, ''and 1 percent of $500 million is a lot of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG For one thing, the big deal fell apart. Lenders were skittish because the money would be used to build a factory in Asia, Mr. Humet said, and they were wary of dealing with a foreign government. In addition, lenders wound up imposing stricter parameters for alternative loans. He also said that P &amp; H clients often had unrealistic expectations about how much money they could get. ''We had a restaurant owner that needed $300,000 to open another location, but we could only get him $150,000,'' Mr. Humet said. ''He didn't go through with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK Mr. Humet said he and Mr. Porat did not anticipate how difficult it would be to place even their best applicant's loans. Since closing P &amp; H, Mr. Humet has helped start MyFreebeez.com, which promotes small businesses online using free giveaways. Mr. Porat operates Recovery of Judgment and Judgment Marketplace, an online marketplace where monetary judgments can be bought, sold and traded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor Cost Projections</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ScooterFood, a maker of all-natural dog food based in Brooklyn, opened in 2006 and closed last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, Michelle Lewis found herself unemployed when the online art gallery where she worked -- in the shadow of the World Trade Center -- went out of business. An animal lover with time on her hands, she began cooking all-natural meals for her dog, Scooter Mae, who did not like canned food. Friends suggested she turn the meals into a business, and in 2006, she started ScooterFood. The company was promising enough to win a second prize award of $5,000 at the PowerUP! Business Plan Competition at the Brooklyn Public Library in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG Ms. Lewis said her business plan was more hopeful than it should have been. Because her food was perishable, she sold it frozen -- but did not realize that in 2006 few pet stores had freezer space. In part because frozen food was expensive to ship, ScooterFood was priced higher than other dog foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK Ms. Lewis said she should not have done her own bookkeeping: ''I didn't project my costs well and never really knew if my revenue was covering them.'' Over five years she invested about $60,000. With a clearer picture, she said, she might have closed the business sooner. In September, Ms. Lewis started Spoonable, a line of caramel sauces. She has hired outside bookkeeping help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Missing Profits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SmartyVA was an online training program for virtual assistants who specialize in social media management that was based in San Luis Obispo, Calif. It opened in 2009 and closed last February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK In 2009 Starr Hall, a public relations consultant who was overwhelmed with requests for social media help, saw an opportunity. She invested $10,000 to create SmartyVA training materials and a Web site with a search engine that aggregated job leads. The six-week training program cost $1,000 and was aimed at stay-at-home mothers and disenfranchised women, like victims of domestic violence. When graduates took jobs through leads on the site, SmartyVA received 10 percent of their earnings. The company generated $100,000 in revenue its first six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG SmartyVA's profitability depended on graduates following up on job leads they received through the system. ''A hundred virtual assistants finished the program, but only 21 of them were working,'' Ms. Hall said. ''If all of them had been working, profits would have been huge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK ''I didn't anticipate how different the mindset of the women I was training was from my own,'' she said. Ms. Hall has returned to consulting. Her new book is, ''The Social Wave: Why Your Business Is Wiping Out with Social Media and How to Fix It.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATHENS -- With all the contraction in the Greek economy, with employees laid off en masse and one in four small businesses forced to close, it might seem odd that new shops are springing up like mushrooms in Athens and other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the stores -- pawnshops and gold dealers -- are thriving as Greeks who are short of cash give up jewelry and other valuables to make ends meet and pay new taxes. The authorities reported a veritable explosion in the sector, with 90 percent of the nation's 224 officially registered pawnshops having opened in the past year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these entrepreneurs insist that their services are legitimate, the Greek authorities contend that many of the shops are concealing a rapidly expanding illicit trade in gold, and that much of it is being smuggled out of the debt-racked country, confounding efforts to curb rampant tax evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar trends have been reported in other countries that were hit by recession. In the United States and Britain, weakening economies and turmoil in credit markets have helped gold dealers thrive. A decade ago, the same happened in Argentina, after its economic meltdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greece, new outlets are springing up on streets where bankrupt stores have been boarded up. Competing with old-school pawnbrokers who work out of tiny stores on side streets, the new professionals lease central locations, taking advantage of falling rents. They advertise in newspapers and on television, and slip promotional leaflets under doors and on car windshields. Many also accept cars, yachts and real estate from Greeks no longer able to finance affluent lifestyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many jewelers have joined in, putting placards in their windows reading ''I buy gold.'' And there are signs of foreign interest. One Italian jewelry wholesaler, which has opened several franchises in Greece, accepts gold teeth as well as jewelry in exchange for cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although most traders are reluctant to talk, those who do say they are just seizing an opportunity created by hard times and the high price of gold, roughly $1,600 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gold is strong -- so there's a lot of interest in selling,'' said Yiannis Spiratos, manager of a pawnshop in central Athens. ''We're just serving that interest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that 8 in 10 customers sold their goods outright, rather than pawning them. ''Some sell their jewelry because they never wear it; many say they need the money to pay the emergency tax,'' he said, referring to a new tax on property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside his shop, a smartly dressed middle-aged woman said she had just sold some earrings and her husband's gold watch. ''He couldn't do it; he was too embarrassed,'' said the woman, who gave her name only as Anna. She said she had made around $1,500 from the sale, after visiting four other shops for quotes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an increasing number of Greeks considering cashing in their jewelry or family heirlooms, the country's consumer protection agency recently published guidelines to protect people from unscrupulous dealers. It warns against traders promising particularly high prices and advises consumers to weigh their jewelry at home or to have it assayed at a laboratory run by the national association of goldsmiths. The warning followed a government order for stricter inspections of gold dealers to ensure they are licensed and operating legally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The crisis is an opportunity for many, and that's O.K. as long as it's legal,'' said Nikos Lekkas, the head of inspections at the Financial and Economic Crime Unit of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But although most gold dealers obtain the required operating license from the police, few keep a log of their transactions, as the law dictates. Inspections of pawnshops and gold dealers in Athens indicated that 80 percent were guilty of tax evasion, depriving the government of millions, and possibly billions, of euros in lost revenue, according to the financial crime unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax evasion remains one of the biggest drains on the Greek state, accounting for about $58 billion annually, or 13 percent of gross domestic product. That remains a sore point with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which have lent Greece billions of euros to avert a default that could be catastrophic for the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspections by the financial crime unit suggest that some shops are fronts for illegitimate businesses shipping large quantities of gold out of the country illegally. In one recent raid, the police stopped a car near the western port of Patra that was carrying a half ton of silver bars, but no official documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities traced the cargo to a pawnshop near Syntagma Square, in the heart of Athens. They said the shop had shipped, in a separate delivery, an eighth of a ton of gold bars to Germany, worth an estimated $8.72 million, again without documents. Investigators said they also traced six Cypriot and German offshore companies to pawnshops and gold dealers in Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also signs that some pawnshops are receiving stolen goods, particularly jewelry, which is hard to trace because it is quickly sold or melted down in foundries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most pawnshops deny working with foundries. The foundries themselves -- whose number tripled during the last year, with 10 now operating in the Athens area -- were tight-lipped. Several denied that they worked with gold and none were listed as doing so in Greek directories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some financial experts say the trade is much like any other, some of it legal and some not, with the only difference being the higher value of gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since the beginning of time, people have melted down or sold their jewelry when the need arises,'' said Babis Papadimitriou, an economics commentator. ''This is what Greeks are doing now.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Unpopular and divided, the once mighty House Republicans are laboring to repair their image and frame a new agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absent for now is a big, contentious docket similar to last year's, which included the goal of writing new health care legislation to replace the Obama administration's law. A long-promised overhaul of the tax code seems out of reach. When Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader, issued a memo this week laying out the body's initial legislative agenda, a centerpiece was a modest tax cut for small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their poll numbers sinking and President Obama attacking them -- and poking fun in a weekend speech at the infighting among their leaders -- House Republicans long to establish a reputation as the party of job creation and to blunt the notion that they are recalcitrant and combative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senior Republicans are eager to minimize the drama, letting the party's presidential candidate, when he is finally chosen, take the lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of us expect the major decisions aren't going to be made this year,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former chairman of the House Republican campaign committee. ''It's a very political year. The big thing for us is to not be part of the conversation instead of trying to inject ourselves into it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But attracting positive attention while avoiding confrontation is proving to be a challenge in an election year, particularly for a group that in 2011 seemed to relish showdown after showdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members are still struggling to sing from the same legislative hymnal. Many want to do bigger things, like a tax code overhaul and changes to the Medicare program. Others, including Mr. Cantor, knowing they will get no help from Senate Democrats, seem to favor more incremental steps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the more conservative members, particularly some freshmen, want to continue taking the good fight to Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should focus on standing for principle and put the politics aside,'' said Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, who is in a Republican primary fight for a seat in the Senate. ''You have to keep doing what you think is the right thing to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others desperately want to find bipartisan compromises that can become law. ''The system is designed to make things difficult,'' said Representative John Campbell of California. ''You just have to persevere. Agreements take time, and they're supposed to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside pressures from each end of the political spectrum, which have dogged the House all year, are myriad: a five-year transportation bill, a major priority of Speaker John A. Boehner, is already being attacked by the left, for including new oil drilling as a way to pay for the bill, and the right -- Heritage Action for America, a conservative group, is urging Republicans to reject new highway spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor, whose strained relationship recalls the days of the intraparty intrigue that bedeviled Newt Gingrich as speaker, have had to spend time trying to stamp out perceptions that they are working at dangerous cross-purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their tensions are so well known that Mr. Obama joked about the two at a black-tie banquet Saturday night. (''Speaker Boehner, it is good to see you at the head table. I know how badly Eric Cantor wanted your seat.'') Members grouse regularly about the seeming divisions, and Mr. Cantor's staff felt it necessary this week to extensively explain that their two staffs had called a truce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As you're clearly aware,'' Mr. Boehner said Thursday, ''there have been some staff rumbles from time to time, but that's to be expected when you're doing big things. And members and our staffs, they're passionate about what they do. Sometimes that leads to some disagreements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, a tangle in December over extending the payroll tax cut pitted House Republicans against Senate Republicans, who argue that their House colleagues need to settle down and find a uniform message with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A body of 535 doesn't sing easily in one chorus,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee. ''I would get up in the morning, look in the mirror and say three words: 'the Obama economy,' '' he said, ''Then say, 'They've been in charge, they made it worse, we can make it better.' And remember all three messages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defense is not a position that House Republicans of the 112th Congress are accustomed to playing. The group had remarkable leverage last year, setting the agenda on spending -- reining it in beyond what even Mr. Boehner would have dreamed -- and beating back Democrats on a variety of policy areas in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the public audience was not always wowed by their accomplishments. Polls showed that many Americans, even those who agreed with the Republican fiscal agenda, found the process, which included nearly shutting down the government, too messy. And among hard-core conservatives, the Republican gains were often too slight to win them applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their retreat in January, Republicans tried to get back on the same page. They are now trying hard to demonstrate where they agree with Democrats, like in the area of small business, while still hammering away at Mr. Obama on unemployment and energy policy, subjects they think resonate with voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the Supreme Court find fault with some or all of the health care law, Republicans will be ready with a replacement, they say, and will push a bill banning stock trades by lawmakers and staff members with conflicts of financial interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House and Senate negotiators are already locked in talks to extend the payroll tax cut through the rest of the year, as well as to extend unemployment compensation and stop a deep cut in payments to doctors treating Medicare patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had a lot of positive discussions about the year ahead,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, ''and our members are united against the president's policies, which are making the economy worse, and united in our efforts to offer better solutions to help middle-class families and small businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Democrats, for all their excitement over the other party's missteps, have their own problems, including retirements by members in districts tilting Republican.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small, for now, may be best, Republicans say. ''We are worried about trying to produce a result, make incremental progress and find common ground here,'' said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor. Time and time again, he said, ''when you try to go big and grand and do grand bargain-type deals, it collapses of its own weight.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most sweeping patent system changes in more than 50 years became law in September with enactment of the America Invents Act, which the White House has said will help turn inventions into businesses faster. Entrepreneurs and small-business owners who rely on the patent system to protect their intellectual property are just starting to understand the changes, which phase in over an 18-month period that ends in March 2013.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this small-business guide, business owners were asked about three of the most significant changes -- the shift from a first-to-invent system to first-to-file and the additions of a fast-track approval process and a postgrant review process. (Patents are sought by inventors to protect original inventions, processes and designs; they are different from trademarks, which protect brand names, logos and anything else that signifies something's source.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIRST TO FILE One of the most debated changes was the move to first-to-file.Before America Invents, patents generally went to the person who invented first. Any one who challenged a patent had to do so by using ''prior art'' -- typically public work like documents published before the patent claim was granted. Such a challenge could be countered with private evidence like dated sketches, notebooks and models. Starting next year, patents will be issued according to who files first, aligning the United States' system with Europe's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Pate, co-founder of ElliptiGO in Solana Beach, Calif., said the change would force his company to file quickly, even if it was not ready. ElliptiGO, which has about 3,000 customers and more than $5 million in revenue, sells a bicycle that uses an elliptical motion to propel it -- essentially an elliptical trainer that can be ridden on the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pate and his co-founder Brent Teal had the idea for the fitness device in 2005 but did not file a patent application for 14 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We needed the time to experiment and develop a proof of concept,'' Mr. Pate said. ''If it had been first-to-file back then, a bigger company with an engineering staff and money could have heard about us doing this and filed before us. If we rushed our filing to prevent this, we would have ended up with a much less valuable set of patents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old system also allowed them to delay spending money. ''If we had to start the patenting process immediately, we would have had to commit to spending $20,000 to $30,000 before we were certain which attributes of our invention were the most valuable,'' Mr. Pate said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Nick Blitterswyk, chief executive of Urban Green Energy in New York City, says he thinks moving to first-to-file will make his company less vulnerable to infringement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With this change, you will know what else is out there because inventors will file as soon as possible,'' and their patent applications will be available, said Mr. Blitterswyk, whose company makes vertical axis wind turbines, which are smaller and quieter than the more common horizontal axis turbines used in wind farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitterswyk said it would be reassuring to potential investors to know a business had filed first, which would ''make it easier to secure investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis J. Foreman, founder of Edison Nation, which produces the PBS show ''Everyday Edisons,'' agrees. ''With first-to-invent you run the risk of going through the patent process and at any time someone can I say, 'I thought of that two years ago, here's my notebook,' '' said Mr. Foreman, who is also chief executive of Enventys, a product-design company that has more than 500 patents. ''It makes it difficult to raise money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it will still be possible to challenge a patent, he added, being first to file ''gives you a stake in the ground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FAST TRACK A new expedited examination will allow businesses to get around the patent applications backlog, which today stands at about 668,000. It can take three to four years just to get a first response, said John A. Dragseth, a lawyer in the Minneapolis office of Fish &amp; Richardson, an intellectual property firm. The examination, known as Track One, will set a target of 12 months for getting applications through the process for a $4,800 fee. ''Sure, it costs more, but a business could use it to expedite their core idea, their home run,'' Mr. Dragseth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since September, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has received 2,000 fast-track requests. But Mr. Pate of ElliptiGO said he was not likely to try it. ''Having to spend more money to speed up the process favors big companies, not small ones,'' he said. ''Accelerated patents also mean accelerated cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Skyline Solar</span> in Mountain View, Calif., took advantage of a similar fast-track program, the Green Technology Pilot Program, which is being phased out in favor of Track One. <span class="companylink">Skyline Solar</span>, which manufactures photovoltaic systems that track sunlight and produce energy, was able to get a patent in 10 weeks through the Green Tech program. ''We went from an unforecasted length of time to instantly in the patent office,'' said Tim Keating, vice president of marketing and field operations. ''And that's innately good for innovators.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE POSTGRANT REVIEW With the new postgrant review process, anyone can challenge claims in a patent for nine months after it is granted. And the case goes before a patent examiner, not a court. ''If you have a big competitor creating a cloud over your product with a patent,'' said Mr. Dragseth, the intellectual property lawyer, ''this is a way to take care of that without spending millions on litigation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Hulls, co-founder of Life360 in San Francisco, says he believes the postgrant review will make it tougher for very broad patents to be issued, and that could mean less frivolous litigation. ''Those broad patents are scary,'' said Mr. Hulls, whose 15-employee business created an application that uses a cellphone's location to enable family members to keep track of one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents, for example, can have their children check in via the app or they can see for themselves when their child has arrived at a destination. There is also a panic button that will send an e-mail alert to every family member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every start-up is probably infringing on someone's I.P. but it might be completely bogus,'' Mr. Hulls said, in reference to intellectual property. ''It's just because the other patent is so broad. Now it will be easier to oppose a patent like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Tate Scott, chief executive of <span class="companylink">KFx</span> Medical, said patent examiners were generally more knowledgeable about patents than judges. ''If you go through that review process and survive,'' he said, ''your patent will be stronger and less likely to be challenged.'' KFx Medical, a 12-employee company based in San Diego, created a device and method for reattaching tissue to bone during orthopedic surgery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CHANGE THAT WAS NOT MADE Chris Allen is chief executive of a nine-person Boston start-up, Brass Monkey, which has an application that turns smartphones into game controllers for its browser-based video game console. He had hoped America Invents would address the issue of so-called patent trolls, companies and individuals that sue to protect patents even if they are not using them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was one of the biggest concerns small businesses had,'' Mr. Allen said. He added that he wished the law ''included a provision that said you have a certain window of time to use your patent, and if you don't, you lose it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James R. Klaiber, an intellectual property lawyer with Pryor Cashman in New York, says he believes there is another side to the issue: many start-ups defend patents they are not using, he said, to maintain the company's value. And some small companies get broader patents than they need to create a kind of fence around themselves. ''They do that to protect themselves from others moving into their space,'' Mr. Klaiber said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: February 14, 2012, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on the Small Business page on Thursday about the reaction of business owners to new patent laws defined the term ''prior art'' incorrectly. Prior art is used to challenge a patent -- not to establish it. The term refers to items in the public domain, like books, patent applications and academic papers, that predate a patent claim; it does not refer to private documentation from the patent claimant. (Private documentation from the patent claimant, like dated sketches, notebooks, drafts of academic papers and models, can be used to defend a patent against a challenge.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEPID economic growth has left many people out of work or underemployed. While some wait for a better job, or any job at all, to come along, others will try to create their own jobs from scratch by starting a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What budding entrepreneurs may not realize is that there is a fair chance of creating tax headaches for themselves, too. Going into business is likely to mean more forms to fill out, tax authorities warn, and more complexity because the paperwork often relates to obscure nooks and crannies of federal and state tax codes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tax and compliance issues are more complicated than ever before,'' said Warren Hudak, head of the accounting firm Hudak &amp; Company in New Cumberland, Pa. ''Virtually every new employer has difficulty getting used to withholding taxes and the sheer volume of work that's involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between what they must send in on behalf of their workers and their own income, sales and payroll tax obligations, ''employers could be filing tax payments three, four, five times a month,'' Mr. Hudak said. ''It makes it very hard for a small-business guy who understands widgets to keep up with those things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Zander recalls the bewilderment that she and her husband, Doug, felt when they left their jobs as software engineers in San Francisco during the dot-com bust and set up their ''little, teeny yarn shop'' in Truckee, Calif., in 2001. The shop evolved into Jimmy Beans Wool, which does about $6 million in annual sales, mostly online, from the company's new base in Reno, Nev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things seemed overly complicated in the beginning,'' she said. ''There was a learning curve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One ''unfortunate tax event,'' she said, provided an expensive lesson. The couple mistakenly took a substantial write-off for the cost of inventory one year early on, when it turned out that the deduction was supposed to be taken gradually as the merchandise was sold. Correcting the error greatly raised their stated income and therefore their tax liability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tax bill ended up being significantly more than we thought,'' Ms. Zander said. ''It totally smacked us in the face. It was something nobody told us, and I swear we asked four or five accountants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment of inventory is one of many fussy, quirky procedures that tax authorities and legislatures require businesses to follow. James Markham, a tax specialist at <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> who focuses on issues that entrepreneurs face, refers to them as ''the gotcha-type things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances that they will trip up a business increase as activities reach a certain level of complexity, such as when someone other than a family member goes on the payroll or sales cross state lines, Mr. Markham said. That is when accounting services become particularly important. Not only do errors cost money, but preventing them can carry a cost measured in wasted hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're this entrepreneur,'' he said, ''and you're saying, 'What's the best use of my time -- document my tax position in case I'm audited or sell my product?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax issues for online businesses that sell into many states and abroad can be especially problematic, advisers caution. Some states, short of cash, are trying to force companies to collect tax on sales made to their residents, even when the companies are based elsewhere. Court challenges leave the success of the tactic in question, but if the trend catches on, companies could find it harder to comply with the various sets of rules and tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just can't afford to do that,'' Ms. Zander said. ''It would be a huge burden. We would have to change all our software and hire a bookkeeper just for that. That's a game changer for a small online business like ours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring a competent tax professional makes sense, even for businesses with less intricate financial affairs -- if one is available. A common complaint among small-business owners is that it's hard to find a good accountant because they are caught in a no-man's land. Their financial affairs can be too intricate for off-the-shelf software or for someone accustomed to filing returns only for individuals, but the enterprises are often too small for business specialists to bother with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what David Mendez discovered after he opened the Grapeful Palate, his wine shop in Morristown, N.J., in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had to go through three accountants before we finally landed the one we're happy with now,'' he said. ''We're a small, family-owned business. When we were looking for an accountant, we wanted someone who understood that and would help us grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he said, one accountant was hard to reach, and another charged many fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would ask simple yes-or-no questions and be charged $75,'' Mr. Mendez said. ''Every time we had a question, we would get a bill in the mail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was all the more galling, he said, because, as a fledgling business owner, his questions were numerous. ''Please don't assume we know any of this,'' he said. ''We know about wine and operating our store.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hudak expressed disdain for peers who charged for each small service, and he encouraged start-ups to seek someone who charged an inclusive fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A firm should have a retainer, like $150 a month, to cover payroll tax returns and other filings,'' he said. ''What you get for the monthly fee is a relationship, someone you can lean on. There should be no charge for a phone call or per page.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mendez was impressed by the accountant he has now in part because of the questions that the accountant asked, not answered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He sat down and asked us what the goals for the business were, where we want to get to in the next couple of years,'' he said. ''He shaped our ideas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By addressing such big-picture issues, the accountant may have provided a more vital service to Mr. Mendez than tax planning. While tax matters are an important concern for business owners, advisers say, there are many others to prepare for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's useful for entrepreneurs is to develop a business plan with goals and objectives, with taxes being a part of that,'' Mr. Markham said. ''Folks that are successful are the ones that have done that.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT is two minutes before 9 at night. The Staples store I use, for tasks I once did in an office, closes at 9. After I press my face to the glass door, pleadingly, holding work that must be finished tonight, the kindly manager lets me in. Then I join a half-dozen others still busy inside, at the copier or the scanner, dropping off <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> packages, or picking up their new business cards with amorphous job titles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I used to go to a different office supply store. Then came the day it ran out of <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> envelopes. Oops, the store employee at its <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> counter said, directing me to his counterpart at its <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span> station. There, no one mentioned that it, too, had run out of padded envelopes. Then, without a word of warning, an employee put the CD I was sending, containing a video of a speech I had made, into a plain manila envelope, tagged it with its destination and rang up the bill in record time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, I explained, the CD would never get to its destination in one piece the way it was packaged. ''Sorry for the miscommunication,'' I said. (Yours, not mine, I muttered to myself -- but not out loud, being a believer in honey rather than vinegar.) ''Please give me my money back and I'll take it elsewhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No you won't, lady; it's already rung up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, sir, I will take it elsewhere. I clearly asked for a padded envelope and an important job depends on this.'' Anger, hard as I fought it, rose in my throat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument that ensued is best not described here. In any case, I was too cheap to take back the overnight package I'd already paid for. The CD -- for a potential client to view before deciding whether to hire me for a speaking engagement -- indeed broke en route. I did not get the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then I went looking for a new store to patronize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is my brave new world of entrepreneurial life, which began after I took a voluntary buyout from The New York Times in 2008. After working as a reporter and correspondent for 29 years, I was eager for a midlife adventure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After I left, though, it felt strange not to work in an office, with its regular hours, bosses and, most important, co-workers and a sense of community. I joined the legions of solo operators who took their computers to places like <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, seeking the sound of other people breathing. We knew the mental-health danger of staying home for weeks in the same dirty terrycloth robe, talking only to our animals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I missed my office friends a lot. But I expected that. What I didn't expect was how much I missed the copy machine, the scanner, the <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> pickup, and the I.T. guy, whom I didn't have to pay to repair equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could I have bought all the necessary machines for my nifty home office? I could have, though it would have been very expensive, and it's a tight fit in there already. Besides, I hate gadgets, so the fewer the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could I call for home pickup from U.P.S. or open a <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> account? I guess I could. But I like going to Staples, now that I've found the right one, where people who are making far from royal salaries still care about doing their jobs well. They even know my name there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There used to be a neighborhood store, Office Inc., but it closed as the big chains grew. I loved Office Inc. For years after it was gone, I'd see the owner around town and embarrass myself by tearing up. The sight of her would make me think that the bad guys, in some I-don't-know-where corporate headquarters, had won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet each big-box store, once you get past the fact that it looks the same as the others, has its own personality. The one I use now, with the manager who lets me in at two minutes till 9, has employees who help people slide balky credit cards through supposedly self-service fax and copy machines. It has a middle-aged woman selling computers because other middle-aged women don't like doing business with dudes who call them Ma'am, or who condescend to them as if they don't understand speedy technospeak, or who don't even answer questions because their iPod buds are in their ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WOULD I choose to be in a Staples at 9 p.m. if I could help it? Not on your life. At times like this, I miss the perks, shrunken though they may be, of being a lifer in a big corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even out here in each-man-for-himself-land, there is kindness and camaraderie. That's why I make it a point to patronize this ''nice'' Staples: because being nice matters a lot in this brave new entrepreneurial world.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Silicon Valley, where engineers in khakis write software code, might not at first glance have much to do with the world of rap music, where artists in sagging pants write irreverent lyrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ben Horowitz, a prominent venture capital investor here, says rap holds a trove of lessons for tech entrepreneurs. Throw business classes and books out the window, Mr. Horowitz says, and listen to rap lyrics instead.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He applies his theory on his blog, where he has attracted a following of tech readers and other executives by offering business lessons, almost all of them preceded by a rap lyric that summarizes a moral, and with recordings from Grooveshark, the music site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the process, he has linked two cultures in Silicon Valley, which is not exactly known for its racial or cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs may do well to listen to Mr. Horowitz's advice. He started the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz with Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, and the firm made vast amounts of money on investments in companies like <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and Skype, and stands to make more on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, the firm announced that it had raised its third fund in three years, $1.5 billion in fresh capital, a large amount even in Silicon Valley. The two men previously started Opsware, a data center software company, and sold it to <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz uses rap as an introduction as he philosophizes about business challenges like how to fire executives, why founders run their companies better than outside chief executives and how to stand up to difficult board members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the management books are like, 'This is how you set objectives, this is how you set up an org chart,' but that's all the easy part of management,'' Mr. Horowitz said in an interview in his spacious office here on Sand Hill Road, the epicenter of tech investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The hard part is how you feel. Rap helps me connect emotionally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How to deal, for instance, with the stress of the 11th-hour, late-night auditing mishap that almost stymied the $1.6 billion sale of Opsware?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen to the Kanye West song ''Stronger'': ''Now that that don't kill me/Can only make me stronger/I need you to hurry up now/'Cause I can't wait much longer/I know I got to be right now/'Cause I can't get much wronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of rap is about business, whether the drug business, the music industry or work ethic, said Adam Bradley, an associate professor specializing in African-American literature at the University of Colorado at Boulder who wrote ''Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop'' and co-edited ''The Anthology of Rap.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It comes out of the fact that rap is such a direct mode of expression, maybe more so than any other music lyric, because of the emphasis on language, of words above melody or harmony,'' Mr. Bradley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People think of rap lyrics as being only about money, women, status and cocaine, he said, but more pervasive themes are leadership, collaboration and the vulnerability beneath the swagger -- all relevant in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said he made that discovery in the early 1980s, when he was introduced to rap as one of few white players on the Berkeley High School football team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He began using lyrics to make his points when he became a chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, for instance, one of the entrepreneurs that Andreessen Horowitz financed clashed with a disparaging board member. Mr. Horowitz advised the executive that he was being too deferential and needed to show his strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he sent the executive ''Scream on Em,'' a rap song by The Game, because its ''superaggressive'' lyrics -- so aggressive that none can be printed in a family newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I couldn't have explained what I was talking about quite right, but he called and said, 'I've been listening to that song every day, and everything is better,' '' Mr. Horowitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he explained on his blog why his venture firm favored founding chief executives, as opposed to those hired to run companies, he had trouble explaining one of the more subtle reasons -- people care more about something they started, while outsiders care more about money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he remembered a lyric by Rakim from the song ''Follow the Leader:'' ''You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid/I'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said, ''Because it's Rakim, and he's like the greatest rapper of all time, he could fit into two sentences what it took me three pages to explain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a simple response to those who say Silicon Valley is in the midst of another bubble, including those who have criticized his firm's large investments as having played a role in inflating the bubble. It's LL Cool J's song ''Going Back to Cali:'' ''I'm going back to Cali ... hmm, I don't think so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's totally about the way he said it -- 'Hmm, I don't think so' -- which is how I was feeling about the bubble talk,'' Mr. Horowitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz's use of rap connects two cultures that are rarely linked. African-Americans hold only 6.7 percent of computer jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and their representation among Silicon Valley entrepreneurs is even smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, Mr. Horowitz's posts led to an appearance before the Congressional Black Caucus. He talked to the group about how the Internet brings different cultures together and about the role African-Americans have played in social media and mobile technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley ''can leave a lot of people on the outside looking in,'' said Jason Lee, a follower of the blog who helped organize the panel and is the son of Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat and a caucus member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that he begins with a relevant hip hop lyric immediately contextualizes the narrative into something familiar and accessible to people from a wide variety of experiences,'' Mr. Lee said. ''To the extent that more people read his blog, relate to his posts and can place themselves in the situations he describes, I think more people will feel like Silicon Valley has room for them as well.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STAMFORD, Conn. -- The old Town Hall here, a Beaux-Arts building on the National Registry of Historic Places, has sat unused for 25 years, a victim of Stamford's rapid growth in the 20th century. But the Town Hall will join the 21st-century economy, with the announcement this month that it would become an incubator for business start-ups in a 10-year lease agreement with private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stamford Innovation Center, as the venture is called, is expected to open by summer, and aspiring entrepreneurs will get work space, mentoring and access to investors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acting as a corporate sponsor for the venture will be Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter maker and military contractor based in nearby Stratford, Conn. The company, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">United Technologies</span>, has leased 2,000 square feet on the building's second floor, and will coach tenants and may even invest in them, said Chris Van Buiten, the vice president for Sikorsky Innovations, a network of employees focused on finding new technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sikorsky is priming the pump by issuing five technological challenges to the public that, on the surface, are aviation related. It is seeking proposals on, among other things, ways to apply wireless monitoring to digitized aircraft and to obscure the visibility of airplanes in flight. Successful applicants will have use of the company's space at the Town Hall for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In much the same way that Sikorsky does not make the engines or avionics that are installed into our helicopters,'' Mr. Van Buiten said, ''likewise will some next-generation technology solutions not be produced by us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stamford Innovation Center is renting most of the old Town Hall from the city. The Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development provided a half-million-dollar loan to turn the building into modern office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008 the city began renovating the Town Hall, with the hope of finding a tenant. It spent $16 million enlarging the space and making it handicapped-accessible. Patty Meagher, a founder of the Innovation Center, remembers the time she and the others involved with the project first considered leasing the building as the work was completed in 2010. ''Remember the line from that movie, 'You had me at hello'? That was the initial reaction,'' she said when they first saw the limestone facade, iron-railed staircase, terrazzo floors and brilliant murals on the walls of several rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location was also an asset, she said, in the shadow of Stamford Town Center mall, steps from the city's library, theater, shopping and dining districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no restrictions on the kinds of ideas that will be considered for the center, so long as the directors believe there is potential for turning them into successful businesses. A few start-ups are already working in the building on projects as varied as a GPS-enabled community news site and the use of cloned immune cells for medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As fledgling businesses develop, tenants will be introduced to venture capitalists, many of whom live or work in the area, Ms. Meagher said. The investors and entrepreneurs, she said, ''will be meeting each other, interacting, and that's how these companies could very well get funded.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business incubators are very of-the-moment across the country. In Chandler, Ariz., the City Council financed a biotechnology-themed center, while a center in Portland, Ore., focuses on sustainability. Nearly three-quarters of these enterprises are sponsored by economic development agencies, governments or academic institutions, according to the National Business Incubation Association. The Stamford Innovation Center is among the 25 percent that are private, with aspirations to become profitable businesses based on rents charged to tenants and educational programs offered to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last five years there have been 150 incubation centers opened nationwide, the association said. While no studies cite the recession as motivating that growth, Linda Knopp, the group's research and policy director, said she believed the economy played a role. ''More communities at least start considering the business incubation concept during economic downturns,'' she said, ''as they're looking for ways to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly that is the goal in Stamford, with a population of 122,643, which has an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, lower than the state and the nation as a whole, but which has lost jobs in the financial and manufacturing sectors and has had an increase in office vacancies. One quarter of the city's 13 million feet of business space is unoccupied, said Laure Aubuchon, the director of the Stamford Office of Economic Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are a victim of our own success, because we keep building space,'' Ms. Aubuchon said. But she said the upside is that when the entrepreneurs are ready to start their businesses they will be able to find affordable rents in Stamford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sikorsky has set a goal of incubating at least two viable companies a year. Barry Schwimmer, a founder of the Innovation Center who is managing the opening, said Sikorsky was setting an example that he hoped other large companies would follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a fairly unique model,'' he said, adding that such communication between large, established businesses and small, untested ones was ''virtually unheard-of.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is developed here will most likely have wider applications, Mr. Van Buiten of Sikorsky said. He offered the example of paint that changes color on a military helicopter, which could also be sold to the automobile industry. ''We'd be willing to spend a lot of money,'' he said of a product like that. ''But think of how that would appeal to teenagers if a car company could offer that kind of paint on a Scion at $1,500.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever want to toss five dozen eggs at your favorite food truck? Hear the owner of a bagel shop croon a song he wrote just for you? Or punch a beloved comics store proprietor in the gut?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are some of the quirkier ''rewards'' devised by Belly, a start-up that creates customer-loyalty programs to encourage repeat patronage at small and medium-size businesses. (You would have to make 50 purchases at AlleyCat Comics in Chicago before taking out your aggression there. And no one has hit either that benchmark or owner Nicholas Idell, just yet.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belly's customer loyalty plans are intended to match the culture of individual businesses, creating experiences to build a relationship between merchant and consumer. What works at a comics store, for example, would not necessarily work at a spa. Tamer incentives include a variety of coupons and discounts, along with ''cut the line'' privileges at coffee shops and grocers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When customers sign up with Belly, they gain access to all the loyalty plans on the company's digital network, cutting down on the need to carry wallet-clogging buy-10-get-one-free punch cards. Participating stores are equipped with iPads that patrons use to sign in and tally points. Belly also offers low-tech options for the analog set: wallet cards or key-chain fobs that can be handed to merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees: 40 full-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location: Based in Chicago, with satellite offices in Austin, Tex., and Madison, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-Founders: Logan LaHive, Belly's 29-year-old chief executive, cut his teeth working for start-ups like Pay By Touch, the biometrics payment company that raised hundreds of millions of dollars before going down in flames, and Redbox, which rents DVDs through in-store kiosks and is now owned by Coinstar. Belly's co-founders, Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, both 42, were on <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>'s three-man founding team and now serve as Belly board members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pitch: ''We're a digital loyalty program. We help replace the traditional buy-10-get-one-free cards with unique customer rewards programs that reflect the culture of small companies,'' Mr. LaHive said. ''It's completely free. You get rewards and experiences at places you already know and love.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traction: Belly has teamed up with more than 515 businesses in Chicago since going live at its first store, the aforementioned comics shop, in August. Some 63,500 customers have accounts; so far, they have checked in at participating businesses more than 195,000 times. Last month, Belly expanded its offerings to Austin, where it now serves 55 businesses. This month, it expanded to 10 locations in Madison. Belly has also shipped kits to stand-alone businesses and chains in about 15 cities the company has not yet selected as core markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue: After a 30-day free trial, Belly charges business owners monthly subscription fees of $50 to $100 a month. Mr. LaHive said Belly was generating revenue but would not release figures. ''We're really focusing exclusively on product and expansion,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing: Belly announced in December that it had received more than $1 million in seed capital from Lightbank, the Chicago early-stage investment firm created and managed by Mr. Keywell and Mr. Lefkofsky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketing: ''We rely on the most traditional form of advertising there is: a one-to-one interaction between a customer and a cashier,'' Mr. LaHive said. Belly furnishes its partners with iPads, along with informational displays and other in-store marketing materials, while building awareness about promotions through e-mail and social media campaigns. Mr. LaHive also hopes Belly's unusual rewards will create a built-in marketing edge by starting conversations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition: ''Loyalty programs, in general, are not a revolutionary concept,'' Mr. LaHive acknowledged. When it comes to digitizing the experience, Mr. LaHive said, ''There are 10 to 15 start-ups competing for this space. What it comes down to is who creates the model with the least amount of friction, the most engagement in terms of users.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from old-school punch cards, Belly's competition includes digital upstarts that rely on mobile phones, like CardBank, <span class="companylink">CardStar</span> and Perka, along with tech behemoths like Foursquare and Yelp that are also muscling into the customer loyalty arena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenge: Staying ahead of competitors. ''Loyalty to a small biz isn't about coupons and discounts,'' Mr. LaHive said. ''How can we create a more engaging experience? What creates a more personal connection? I think the main thing that really separates us is the customization and uniqueness, the creativity of the different rewards. We're creating a platform where each store can run their loyalty program as they choose, based on the personality and culture of the store.''</p>

When choosing social networks to invest in, businesses should consider a few different factors. First, is their target audience active on the site? Google+, for example, is dominated by males and also has many students who use the site. The other thing to consider is where your audience is engaging on topics that are relevant to your business. The reason that businesses are excited about Google+ is because of the possibilities for the future and where it may go. The bottom line is that while Google+ holds promise, there isn't a lot for businesses and brands to do on it yet. Even the most popular brands on Google+ are only updating about once a day, and most aren't responding to comments from fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Will being active on Google+ affect a business's search rankings on <span class="companylink">Google</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neher: Exactly how Google+ will impact search-engine rankings in the future is still a source of speculation, but there are some signals that suggest that activity on Google+ can have a positive impact. The most significant way that Google+ will impact search engine results is through the Search Plus Your World functionality, which allows users to see regular search-engine results or the results personalized based on their Google+ network. This would mean that search engine results integrate Google+, which would make the social network important from a search perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Suppose I wanted to get rid of my Web site altogether and just use Google+. Is this feasible?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neher: Google+ isn't currently robust enough to replace a Web site. First, social networks should be used to augment the rest of your online presence. When looking for information about a business, a corporate Web site is still the expectation from customers. Additionally, social networks like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Google+ limit how much information you can display and how you can display it. So in terms of meeting business communication needs, social networks should not be seen as a replacement for a web site. Also, when you create a page on a social network, you don't have full control over it -- the social network can change the rules or remove the page at any time.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally in the coming weeks and months, The Agenda will introduce you to small-business owners who are wrestling with how to provide health insurance to their employees. Over time, we hope to delve into all aspects of a crucial decision - not just managing the costs but sorting out benefit packages, weighing alternatives, and dealing with insurers and brokers. Along the way, we hope to get a better understanding of how the 2010 health-care legislation will, or won't, affect small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today we meet Ann Gish, who designs high-end bed linens from offices in Manhattan. As we proceed with this series, we'd like to hear from you. What questions would you like us to ask of the business owners we profile? Do you have an interesting health insurance story to tell? Please drop us a line.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OWNER Ann Gish, 63.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMPANYAnn Gish Inc. designs and distributes luxury bed and table linens and pillows, which are sold at <span class="companylink">Bergdorf Goodman</span>, NeimanMarcus.com and boutiques nationwide. In 2011, the company opened its own store in Manhattan. Excluding Ms. Gish and her husband, Ann Gish Inc. employs 10 people in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT THE COMPANY PAYS The company bears the entire premium cost for its workforce, $472 a month per employee. It provides individual coverage only, but Ms. Gish said that most of her employees are either unmarried or have spouses who get insurance through their jobs. One sales manager, however, has a self-employed husband with a pre-existing condition and a child. Ms. Gish pays the employee's premiums, and the employee pays the insurance for the rest of her family - an additional $1,300 a month. ''She used her agent, we used our agent, and this was the best we could do,'' Ms. Gish said. ''If she could find a better deal, we'd give her the $500.'' Ms. Gish said she is giving serious thought to reducing the share of employee premiums that her company pays: ''I want to see what happens business-wise over the next year, and I want to see what happens when the health care reform kicks in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE PLAN Ann Gish offers preferred provider organization coverage, a form of managed care that favors doctors and hospitals that are in-network. One aspect of the plan that galls Ms. Gish is that doctors must seek permission from the insurer before prescribing some treatments. However, Ms. Gish said, the plan is ''non-gated,'' meaning that employees don't need permission from their primary doctor to see a specialist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE INSURER Currently, it's <span class="companylink">Aetna</span>; before that, it was Oxford. ''We've changed either every year or every two years,'' Ms. Gish said, ''because they take away the policy that you have, and they give you a new one that's more money and generally fewer benefits.'' In recent years, premiums have bounced around, Ms. Gish said: $422 in 2009, $479 in 2010, back down to $443 last year, and now back up again. Meanwhile, she said, this year employees face slightly higher co-payments and much steeper deductibles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HEADACHE Pounding and relentless. Even simple tasks, she said, like adding or removing employees from the rolls, are complicated: ''My husband, who does all of the C.F.O. stuff, has spent hours and hours and hours on this. And I spend a couple days a year on it. And I'm not stupid. I've started a successful business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT DIFFERENCE THE OVERHAUL HAS MADE SO FAR None. She looked into the health care tax credit available to small businesses under the law but found that the average wages her company pays exceed the law's $50,000 threshold for the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT SHE WANTS FROM REFORM Simplification. Health insurance, Ms. Gish said, ''should be put together in a way that any idiot could understand.'' Though Ms. Gish has occasionally read press accounts of how the Affordable Care Act will change insurance, she concedes that she still does not know what to expect. ''I figure when 2014 comes, I'll have to learn it,'' she said. ''But since I feel pretty powerless about doing anything, and since it could all change before then, what's the point in trying to sink your teeth into it now?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you have any thoughts on Ms. Gish's situation? What percentage of employee premiums does your company pay?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Pennsylvania has joined a lawsuit accusing the president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of walking off with the fruits of university research to start his own company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sloan-Kettering president, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, was sued in December by his former workplace, a cancer research institute located at the University of Pennsylvania, which said Dr. Thompson had concealed his involvement with the company.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penn seemed to distance itself from the lawsuit, pointing out that the institute -- the Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute -- was a separate legal entity from the university. And people close to Dr. Thompson pointed to the university's noninvolvement as a sign the accusations were without merit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Wednesday, Penn filed its own complaint against Dr. Thompson in Federal District Court in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit says Dr. Thompson violated the university's patent policy and the terms of his employment ''by failing to disclose to the university research and discoveries that he instead provided to a for-profit corporation and ultimately publicly disclosed in international journal publications, both to the detriment of the university.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit also named <span class="companylink">Agios Pharmaceuticals</span>, the biotechnology company that Dr. Thompson helped start in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university is expected to ask that the two complaints be consolidated and heard together, according to a letter to the judge from David C. Burger, the lawyer representing the Abramson research institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Thompson's attorney, Allan J. Arffa, did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by e-mail after normal business hours on Wednesday. David Schenkein, the chief executive of Agios, said the company was reviewing the complaint and would issue a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Universities typically control the rights to inventions made on their campuses and see them as a potentially major source of revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Penn complaint contains details not included in the initial complaint by the Abramson research institute. It says that Dr. Thompson was a co-author of one scientific paper and the lead author on another related to an enzyme called IDH1 that is a focus of Agios's research into new ways to treat cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit says that before the papers were published in late 2009 and early 2010, Agios filed provisional patent applications based on the research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the second paper was published, Penn's technology transfer office told Dr. Thompson in an e-mail that the work could constitute ''a significant patentable invention.'' Dr. Thomson told the technology transfer office that there was nothing patentable in the research, even though he already knew that Agios had begun filing for patents on the same work, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penn said it suffered at last $100 million in damages. The Abramson complaint said the damages could ultimately exceed $1 billion.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARILIA, Brazil - Atomico went off the beaten path for its first investment in Brazil, and not just in terms of geography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Haroldo Korte, a partner at the venture capital firm, drove 300 miles from Sao Paulo deep into the southern rural interior to meet with Paulo Biancalana, a self-made entrepreneur with no university education who had turned a local auto accessories dealer into a fast-growing Internet business. Working out of a ramshackle building, he had become the country's top seller on a leading e-commerce site, <span class="companylink">MercadoLibre</span>, and started Connectparts - which together gave him annual sales of $10 million.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atomico had to woo Mr. Biancalana, who was initially suspicious of outside investors. After roughly six months and a half-dozen meetings, Atomico invested $7.5 million in the start-up, which is now being courted by other venture capital firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the conditions were against him,'' said Mr. Korte. ''So I said that we have somebody and something special here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As competition heats up for Internet companies, Atomico - started in 2006 by a co-founder of Skype, Niklas Zennstrom - is looking for atypical investments. The London-based firm tends to focus on non-American start-ups, emphasizing its past as entrepreneurs who succeeded beyond the venture capital stronghold of Silicon Valley. Roughly three-quarters of Atomico's companies are based outside the United States, including 6Wunderkinder, an application developer in Berlin, and the Finnish game maker Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atomico looks for profitable, bare-bones start-ups that haven't attracted venture capital attention. In Brazil, the firm's two investments have been in the companies' initial financing rounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Biancalana, 40, wasn't even looking for outside money. ''We were doing very well,'' he said. ''What caught my attention was not the investment but their experience as entrepreneurs and international contacts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zennstrom first saw the potential of opportunities in South America more than a decade ago. In 2001, Kazaa, a music file-sharing company that he helped start, had an unusually large amount of traffic from Argentina. Shortly thereafter, Brazil became one of Skype's largest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the online auction giant <span class="companylink">eBay</span> acquired Skype in 2005, Meg Whitman, then <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s chief executive, suggested Mr. Zennstrom meet the founders of the region's largest e-commerce site, <span class="companylink">MercadoLibre</span>. The relationship continues today, and <span class="companylink">MercadoLibre</span>'s founders, Marcos Galperin and Hernan Kazah, have recommended several entrepreneurs to Atomico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kazah, who recently started <span class="companylink">Kaszek Ventures</span> with Nicolas Szekasy, introduced Atomico to the first three companies in which it invested in the region: the Argentine companies Cinemaki and Restorando and the Uruguayan dining site PedidosYa. Kaszek and Atomico both invested in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Atomico opened an office in Sao Paulo and hired Mr. Korte and Carlos Pires, who was previously in charge of Skype Brazil. An Atomico partner, Geoffrey Prentice, Skype's first employee, also relocated there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We spent a lot of time in China but saw a lot of Western investors already there,'' said Mr. Zennstrom. ''Rather than being late to the party, we went with Brazil.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As deal-making activity picks up, Atomico is going against Silicon Valley stalwarts with deep pockets and a longer investment record. Atomico raised only $165 million for its second global fund, far less than its goal of $266 million. And in the last year, it has lost out on start-ups such as Elo7, the online handicrafts site backed by Monashees Capital, based in Sao Paolo, and <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>, the American venture capital firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Prentice acknowledged that notable deals here had gotten ''very competitive and really expensive,'' which has prompted Atomico to pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The degree of competition has increased in the past year,'' says Claudio Vilar Furtado, a professor at Fundacao Getulio Vargas who specializes in private equity and venture capital. But at this stage in the nascent market, it's not worrisome since ''the extension of supply creates its own demand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To temper the potential risks, Atomico is focused on what it sees as the leaders in growing industries whose potential has not been tapped. Last December, the firm made a $3 million investment in BebeStore, a baby products company based in Sao Paulo, betting on the strong demand for such products online. As one of the first players to develop an online presence, Atomico believed BebeStore had the first-mover advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it had also been reluctant to plow significant money into the business. The co-founder had previously watched his father's construction business suffer because of currency fluctuations, and his past ventures had had mixed success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did not want investors at all,'' said Leonardo Simao, who started Bebe-Store in 2009, with his wife, Juliana Della Nina Simao. ''I wanted to have control'' to maintain a comfortable growth rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Atomico has encouraged Mr. Simao to expand aggressively because of increased competition, including from Baby.com. The firm pushed the start-up to increase its inventory, even if it meant laying out more money in the short term. Atomico estimates the company, which reported $5.6 million in 2011 revenue, could more than double its sales this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simao ''had been told so many times to be conservative and do not lose money. He wanted to go for it but nobody had given him the confidence that he could,'' said Mr. Prentice of Atomico. ''That's an important thing we bring to the table.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican leaders were open about the political pressure that was driving them toward bipartisanship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in an election season, and the test for any candidate is whether they can produce results,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, said after the jobs bill passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big fights are still ahead, especially over a budget proposal in the House and a dozen annual spending bills. But this week produced rare moments of cooperation among House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the White House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today's vote shows both sides should be able to find common ground on this issue, and the president urges them to pass a bill and bring it to his desk without delay,'' said Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference, Mr. Reid called the House bill ''commendable'' and ''a step forward,'' and he urged the lower chamber to approve the Senate transportation bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If success produces a thousand fathers, the JOBS Act will need a paternity test. White House officials stressed that many elements of the House version originated with President Obama's jobs council and proposals he laid out in the fall. And Mr. Schumer noted that he and Senator Patrick Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, first introduced the centerpiece of the House bill, which is ascribed to the freshman Representative Stephen Fincher, Republican of Tennessee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one sour note came on Wednesday when Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, angrily accused House Republican leaders of stealing a bill written by a Democrat, Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, and giving it to a Republican, Representative Ben Quayle of Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, said Democrats were too concerned about credit, Mr. Frank accused him of issuing ''the most hypocritical and dishonest statement'' he had ''ever heard uttered in this House.'' The words were stricken from the official record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobs legislation is narrowly tailored, even though it is being praised by all sides as a big help to the economy. The centerpiece would delay some Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that were passed as a response to the recession and would create a category of ''emerging growth companies'' that would lower the costs of initial public offerings for smaller firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another measure would abolish an S.E.C. rule that prohibits small companies from advertising for investors, a ban that dates to 1982. The bill would also lift restrictions on ''crowd funding,'' which would let entrepreneurs raise capital from large pools of small investors. And the JOBS Act would increase the number of shareholders permitted to invest in a community bank to 2,000, from 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 23 members who voted against the bill were mostly from the most liberal wing of the Democratic Party, and they expressed concern that the bill went too far in dismantling regulations that were intended to protect investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for most, the imperative was to be seen as doing something about the recovering, but still anemic, job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said: ''I think there's a huge sense of frustration with everybody, regardless of party. Nothing's getting done on the most significant issue facing them.'' She said lawmakers would say that their votes were not about the election, but, she added, ''Obviously you turn the corner in an election year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transportation bill will be promoted as a jobs measure, too. Mr. Boehner surprised many Republicans when he told reporters what he had been hinting for a week: ''The current plan is to see what the Senate can produce and to bring that bill up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be a retreat for Mr. Boehner, who had pressed for a five-year transportation bill to be financed by opening up vast tracts of federal property -- on land and sea -- to oil production. Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, who was put in charge of the bill after the chairman of the House transportation committee failed to unite Republicans, expressed surprise at Mr. Boehner's statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Capito, a member of the committee, said she understood the politics behind the announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It'll bring a different dynamic if the Senate passes a bill, and we're the ones holding back,'' she said. ''Our constituents want something done.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is about to carry out a major provision of the new health care law by issuing standards for health insurance exchanges, the markets where consumers and small businesses will be able to buy coverage from competing private plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To encourage states to set up the exchanges, federal officials said, they will give state officials broad discretion to decide the operational details. However, the federal officials made clear that they would set up and operate an exchange in any state that refused to do so.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials said the rules showed how President Obama was moving to expand insurance coverage, even as critics attacked the health care law in Congress, in court and in campaigns for the White House and Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules, to be issued within days, were described by two officials: Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, who testified at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, and Timothy B. Hill, a senior official at the department, who provided additional details on Thursday at a conference of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sebelius said the exchanges would provide one-stop shopping, allowing Americans to compare the prices and benefits of health plans. Insurers will compete for business, she said, and the increased competition will drive down costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In view of regional differences in health care markets, Mr. Hill said, ''we want to give states as much flexibility as possible to choose what works for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want states to be successful in establishing their own exchanges,'' Mr. Hill said. ''We are doing everything we can to help states get ready. But we are not naive. There is a likelihood that some states won't be ready.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the rules, each exchange will certify health insurance plans, operate a Web site comparing costs and benefits, and help consumers enroll. In addition, the exchange will determine who is eligible for federal subsidies, available to people with annual incomes up to four times the poverty level (up to $92,000 for a family of four).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials pointed to these examples of flexibility in the rules:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A state can choose to run an exchange through an existing state agency or through a nonprofit entity established by the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A state can open its exchange to all insurers and health plans, or it can limit the number of health plans available to consumers through the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States can decide what role agents and brokers should have in selling insurance through an exchange. Officials assume that agents will play a significant role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States can allow larger employers to participate. In 2014 and 2015, each exchange will be open to companies with either 1 to 50 or 1 to 100 employees. In 2016, all exchanges will be open to businesses with 1 to 100 workers. Starting in 2017, states can let in companies with more than 100 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If an employer seeks coverage through an exchange, it can designate one health plan for its employees or it can offer them a choice of two or more plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states, like California, Connecticut and Washington, are racing to set up exchanges. Some, like Florida and Texas, have expressed little interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The variation was illustrated by events on opposite sides of the country this week. In Oregon, Gov. John Kitzhaber signed a bill, passed with bipartisan support, specifying how the state's insurance exchange will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The exchange will contribute to the success of our larger health care reform effort,'' said Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democrat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed a bill that prohibits state and local officials from planning or creating a state insurance exchange. The bill goes now to the State Senate, where some Republicans have expressed support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Representative Andrew J. Manuse, a Republican, said the bill was ''part of a national effort to amend, repeal or replace the federal health care law.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constant Contact has been one of the big success stories when it comes to online companies that specialize in serving small businesses. Some half a million of them count on the company's Web-based help in building, managing and creating marketing campaigns around customer e-mail lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Started 14 years ago, the company, which is based in Waltham, Mass., went public in 2007 and has expanded into other areas, including managing social-network marketing campaigns. In February, it introduced yet another service: coupon-based deal marketing. That brings Constant Contact into a crowded field of competition along with <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span>. In a recent interview, condensed below, Gail F. Goodman, Constant Contact's chief executive, explained why she thinks small businesses will prefer her company's service.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.A lot of consumers are already burned out on deals. Are you too late?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We think of SaveLocal as building on the consumer experience that the daily deal companies have demonstrated. Their model has been about large-scale consumer lists, but we saw a while ago that it wasn't perfectly serving our customer base of small businesses, 70 percent of which have fewer than 10 employees. We started talking to our customers about what did and didn't work for them with <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span>. We knew there had to be a better way, but it took us until the beginning of last summer to come up with what we thought would be a twist on the model that would make coupons work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we spent six months developing and testing it to make sure we had it right. We think the timing is actually pretty good, because the merchant community has had a chance to become aware of the issues and problems with the daily deal market, and they've become very open-minded to the idea of structuring deals in a different way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What's different about your model?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> provides quantity, we want to provide quality. We think the way to find your next great customer is through your existing customers, rather than through a big list of consumers who don't know much about you. SaveLocal is about sending coupons to your current customer base, and providing them with an incentive to share the coupons with their social network in order to bring in new customers. We also turn the economics of the deal on its head, by letting the merchant control the amount of the discount so they're not losing money on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What's the incentive for a small business's customers to share a deal with their social network?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The small business chooses the incentive. The reward might be an extra $5 discount on the coupon, or 20 percent off on a second visit, or a free item, or whatever the business wants to offer. But the biggest difference with SaveLocal is that the customer gets the reward just for sharing, whether or not the friends buy anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.By offering smaller discounts, your merchants may protect per-customer profits, but won't the deals be less compelling to consumers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're seeing success with discounts of less than half off. We haven't tested it enough to know exactly at what point you get diminishing returns from decreasing the discount, but we've seen a customer be wildly successful with a 33 percent discount. A smaller discount might not attract as many customers, but it's the rabid deal-seekers who are going to find it less appealing, and that's not necessarily who small businesses want to attract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're changing the whole economics of the deal. The daily deal companies not only make merchants offer about half off, they keep about half of what the merchant takes in on the deal. We only charge $1 to $3 for each coupon. And we help our customers think through the best way to structure the deal. Restaurants can offer a coupon for less than the average ticket and make more when the customer buys up, so that if customers spend $40 on a dinner, the merchant can offer a $20 coupon for $10, and keep all of the extra $20 that the customer spends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.If your customers e-mail their offerings only to existing customers, are they giving up the opportunity to attract lots of new customers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. About a fifth of the people responding to our deals are new customers for the merchant. But more important, because they're getting the offer through an existing customer, they're much more likely to be local than the people who respond to daily deals, and they're much more likely to turn into loyal customers. They're learning about the deal from an existing customer who's endorsing the merchant. And we give merchants the means for following up, by helping the merchant get the new customer's e-mail address and opt-in permission during the purchase process. <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span> don't share contact information with merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why can't a small business send out its own coupons to its own mailing list? Why does it need you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We make it easier and help them structure and manage the deal. We handle the redemption, and we gather and analyze the data, so the merchant can understand the true R.O.I. of the deal based on how much customers spent and how much of it was discounted. And we make it ridiculously affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How do you calculate the return on investment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We think about R.O.I. in two stages. First, the small business wants to know if it made money just on the purchases made by both existing and new customers when they use the coupons, and we track all that to tell our customers exactly how much was spent on the total purchase versus what the business spent on the promotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then we look at the longer-term R.O.I. by tracking how many new customers were brought in and whether they're being turned into loyal repeat customers by collecting their e-mail addresses with permission for the small business to contact them. We'll continue to track that longer-term R.O.I. and help our customers take advantage of it with e-mail campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the deals that have been done with SaveLocal so far, we've seen a good R.O.I. just on the first stage, and now we're starting to see it on the second stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[You can read about a business that tried SaveLocal and one that chose not to at nytimes.com/boss.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Not all businesses have their customers' e-mails. Can this work for a business that hasn't been collecting e-mails?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Certainly it wouldn't be starting from as strong a point as a business that has the e-mail addresses, but yes, a small business can start off SaveLocal through sharing over a social network. We believe it's important that every small business build that e-mail list, and these offers create a great incentive for customers to get on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How is your core business of e-mail-based marketing holding up? Is it being replaced by social-media marketing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We do help customers with social-network campaigns, but e-mail is still one of the fundamental channels of communication. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> just released the statistic that on average only 12 percent of the people that ''like'' a page see a new message from the page owner show up in their news feed. The typical small business only has about 100 people who like their page, which means a total of 12 people are seeing the message. The typical small business has more than 2,000 names on an e-mail list. It wouldn't be smart to stop communicating to those 2,000 people in order to focus on the 100 people they might be able to reach on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- A main indicator of business sentiment in Europe unexpectedly fell deeper toward recession territory Thursday, compounding concerns about the global recovery after signs of slowing manufacturing in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomy data provided a reminder that, despite the aura of calm in Europe after months of debt-crisis fever, the 17 European Union members that use the euro still have fundamental problems.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major stock indexes in Europe fell broadly Thursday, and the euro slipped against the dollar, after a survey of purchasing managers suggested that growth in the euro zone declined in the first three months of the year. That would be the region's second consecutive quarter of negative growth, which would meet the broad definition of a recession. Stocks were also down in the United States. Reinforcing the survey results, manufacturing orders in the euro zone fell 2.3 percent in January from December, according to a report Thursday by Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. That was a slightly bigger drop than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures suggest that the euro zone is still struggling even after a flood of cash from the European Central Bank helped calm fears of a banking crisis and credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The easing of the sovereign debt crisis has apparently failed to bring about a lasting improvement in business sentiment,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span>, wrote in a note to clients. Reports next week should offer more clues about the direction of the European economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the Ifo Institute in Munich will release its monthly survey of business sentiment in Germany, seen as a reliable indicator of growth in the country, the euro zone's largest economy. On Wednesday, the central bank will release its monthly report on the euro zone's money supply, which economists will watch for signs of a recovery in bank lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by the European Systemic Risk Board, which monitors Europe's financial system, warned that banks remained under pressure as they tried to reduce risky assets and find new sources of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main issue is how to ensure the provision of credit to the economy in the current environment,'' the board said. It includes representatives of the central bank, the European Commission and financial industry regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, weak external and domestic demand continued to weigh on the manufacturing sector in March, a survey released Thursday showed, raising expectations that the Chinese authorities would step up measures to revive economic momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey of purchasing managers in the Chinese factory sector, released by <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, showed that activity declined in March for the fifth consecutive month, as the Chinese economy felt the pain of feeble global economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has become a major market for European products as varied as heavy machinery and luxury goods, so a slowdown there worsens problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary reading in the China survey for March dropped to 48.1 from 49.6 in February. Readings below 50 signal contraction, and even though the reading provides only an early insight into this sector of the Chinese economy, the decline was disappointing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar, which is acutely affected by signs of weakness in China, dropped against the United States dollar after the economic figures were released. Oil and gold prices also declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the purchasing managers' survey, compiled by Markit Economics, slipped to a three-month low of 48.7 in March from 49.3 in February. In that survey, too, a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Markit survey also pointed to a decline in German manufacturing. That is particularly worrisome, because German exports have helped to compensate for sluggishness in Southern Europe as countries like Italy and Spain cut government spending to reduce debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any hope that the manufacturing cycle is turning rapidly in the euro area is dashed by today's numbers,'' Stella Wang, an analyst in London for Nomura, wrote in a note. But she said the figures were unlikely to prompt the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest rate from 1 percent, because inflation remained above the official target of about 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese and euro zone economies are closely linked because many German exports, including cars and heavy machinery, are sold there. China has become the largest market for <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> and other German companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With new export orders sluggish and domestic demand still softening, China's slowdown has yet to finish,'' Xiaoping Ma and Qu Hongbin, economists who follow China for <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>, wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist in Hong Kong for <span class="companylink">Credit Agricole</span>, wrote in a research note about the purchasing managers' index, that ''the drop is quite large, especially given that March tends to bring an improvement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the reading is likely to reinforce fears of a hard landing for the Chinese economy, Mr. Kowalczyk emphasized that the slowdown in manufacturing activity was expected to be temporary and that he continued to believe China would have a soft landing, with overall growth this year of 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside is that Beijing has a fair amount of firepower it can deploy to stimulate growth. May analysts say they expect the authorities to employ a range of these tools as the year progresses.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VICE ADM. EDWARD M. STRAW was a bit skeptical when he was asked to donate his time and expertise to a program that helps small-business owners. He had mentored students hoping to get into his alma mater, the Naval Academy, and service members on their way out of the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was different, though. Sure the program carried the imprimatur of the Clinton Foundation and his financial adviser at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> was asking him to participate. But Admiral Straw said he questioned whether his background -- he had commanded the Defense Logistics Agency before a successful second career in the private sector -- would be useful to a small business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'I'll only do this if my skills would help the company,' '' said Admiral Straw, who was president of global operations at <span class="companylink">Estee Lauder</span> and now serves on six boards. ''I wanted a company that made something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I met Admiral Straw last month at a dinner in New York for the 10 teams that had been part of the Small Business Advisory Program, a joint venture of the Clinton Foundation's Economic Opportunity Initiative and <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Wealth Management. My initial interest was in how <span class="companylink">UBS</span> had coaxed the mentors, all busy business people, into giving their time and sharing their expertise with people they did not know. But I became equally intrigued with the entrepreneurs, who all had hit inflection points in their businesses after years of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clinton Foundation program is one of dozens of programs -- some more successful than others -- that pair entrepreneurs with mentors, from those overseen by the Small Business Administration to more specialized ones like the Venture Mentoring Service run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And with Congress and the presidential candidates talking about ways to help small-business owners who have fallen on hard times, I thought it useful to look closely at a program whose success did not depend on money but time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROBLEMS WITH MENTORS One of the top complaints about programs aimed at helping entrepreneurs is that they fail to pair people correctly. But I also heard that some of the programs lack focus and clear goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't have good chemistry, you could have a group discussion about spreadsheets but the business owners won't tell you that they don't get along with their No. 2 person,'' said Bernard H. Tennenbaum, former associate director of the Entrepreneurial Center at the Wharton School and the founding director of the entrepreneurial institute at Fairleigh Dickinson University. ''It's so important for these people to get along,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UBS-Clinton Foundation partnership aimed to avoid the common pitfalls by focusing on vetting both the mentor and the person being mentored. It also put a <span class="companylink">UBS</span> financial adviser into the mix to help maintain clearly defined goals that could be accomplished in a short period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew from the Clinton Foundation why the business owners wanted to participate ahead of time and so we could make a better match,'' said Lori Feinsilver, who runs the program for <span class="companylink">UBS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Admiral Straw's experience got off to an inauspicious start. The owner of the first company he was supposed to help did not show up for the introductory lunch. But the next business proved to be a perfect match: Linda Tool, which manufactures precision components for military contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admiral Straw said that the Linda Tool plant in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn was much different from what he expected. The 12,000-square-foot shop was spotless, and the company had won industry certifications for the quality of its products. Michael DiMarino, its president, was managing his inventory, expenses and profits well. On the surface, it seemed as if there would be little for Admiral Straw to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. DiMarino said his big problem was that his business had stagnated after the 2008 financial collapse. ''I never had to do marketing,'' he said. ''The 1990s were fruitful years, and the business grew until it just stalled. But the price of everything else kept going up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admiral Straw began advising him on how to bid directly with the Department of Defense and military contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I figured we could show him how to go directly to the federal government,'' Admiral Straw said. ''I took him to the Defense Logistics Agency and got him educated by the head of the small-business office on how to bid directly for the jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROBLEMS WITH TIMING The timing of the Straw-DiMarino partnership was fortunate. Therese Flaherty, director of the Small Business Development Center at the Wharton School, said she had found that mentoring programs had the greatest impact when mentors came in at a point when the business owners were struggling with something that had stymied their original idea. This usually has something to do with finances or employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DiMarino said from 2008 to 2010 he worked hard not to lay off any of his employees. He said he was proud that many of his machinists had been with him for decades. But he had moved to a new, larger space and, he said, he was eager to figure out a way to increase his business since he had the capacity to do more work. Now that he is bidding directly for many contracts, he expects his sales to increase to $5 million this year from $3.8 million in 2011. His experience with Admiral Straw, in other words, has worked out well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">K. Y. Chow, who owns GM Printing, was also trying to expand his company. Over 18 years, he had won many city contracts for his printing company, but he moved into a larger plant in Long Island City just as the economy slowed. He wanted to know how to increase his sales beyond the contracts he had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was paired with Don Terwilliger, president of Digital Color Concepts, a much larger and more established printing company. ''The first question was, 'Tell me the problem I'm having,' '' Mr. Chow said. ''Is it pricing, quality, logistics?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was sales, since Mr. Chow was the only salesman. He has since hired two additional sales people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEFINING SUCCESS Mentoring programs often struggle to determine if they have accomplished anything. This is just as important for the mentors who are giving their time as the business owners who need help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Azuma, president of Different Roads to Learning, which sells more than 500 learning aids for children with autism, said she had been trying for two years to find a company that could translate her vision into an app that she could sell. She was feeling frustrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Ms. Azuma, who has been part of many mentoring programs, said she had her doubts about the adviser and the entrepreneur assigned to help her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But after we met a few times,'' Ms. Azuma said, ''there was this feeling of accountability in working with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her mentors focused mainly on helping her create the app, but they also worked with her on improving the way she communicated her business goals. ''It was something she dreamed of, and we helped her make it a reality,'' said Amy Butte, a former Wall Street executive and Internet entrepreneur who was Ms. Azuma's mentor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Butte and Ms. Azuma are still in touch. And this is something the program stressed: after the six months of formal work, the teams are expected to stay in contact for at least six months to help the business owners follow through on what they started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(With the success of the New York program, Ms. Feinsilver said <span class="companylink">UBS</span> was expanding it to Chicago and Los Angeles this spring, albeit with different partners.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admiral Straw said he had continued to help Mr. DiMarino, adding that he went with him recently to a job fair for veterans in Stamford, Conn. ''What really kept me in it was Mike's dedication and work ethic,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- Germany's famously thrifty consumers may finally be more willing to spend, according to data released Monday, raising the prospect that domestic demand could take the place of flagging exports and help pull the rest of Europe out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ifo business climate index, which is considered a reliable predictor of the direction of the largest economy in Europe, rose slightly more than expected in March, to its highest level since July, the Ifo Institute in Munich said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unusually, retailers accounted for the rise in the Ifo index; manufacturers and builders became a bit more pessimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is probably early to declare a turning point, there are signs that falling unemployment and rising real estate prices are giving Germans confidence to do more shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Domestic components are holding up better now,'' said Thomas Harjes, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in Frankfurt. ''We are at the beginning of seeing some rebalancing of the German economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's economy has traditionally been driven by exports of cars and machinery, while domestic demand has been comparatively weak. In fact, the country has been something of a graveyard for retailers. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> gave up trying to crack the German market in 2006. Karstadt, the nation's largest chain of department stores, filed for insolvency in 2010, although it has since restructured and become profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany has the largest trade surplus in Europe, which partly reflects the success of manufacturers like Daimler and <span class="companylink">Siemens</span>, but also is a function of weak demand for imported goods. The rest of the euro zone, much of which is stuck in recession, would benefit if Germans bought more products and services from their neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, stronger domestic demand would make Germany less susceptible to economic ups and downs in major export markets like China and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Ifo index pointed only to modest growth in Germany, the resiliency of German business confidence helped calm fears that the nation's economy was slowing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a survey of purchasing managers by the research firm Markit signaled that the broader euro zone probably slipped into recession in the first quarter of 2012. The Markit survey also showed that German manufacturers were becoming less optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harjes of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> pointed out that the Ifo index surveys 7,000 companies, seven times as many as the Markit survey. The Ifo survey therefore captures more small and midsize enterprises oriented toward domestic customers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists generally portrayed the Ifo results as positive, some were more cautious. Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, noted that the indicator rose more slowly in March than in previous months. ''The German economy is losing some of its momentum,'' he said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few economists expect Germany, with its aging population, to become a nation of frenzied shoppers. But after years of stagnation, property values are rising in major cities like Berlin and Frankfurt. That tends to make homeowners feel wealthier and more confident about spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, unemployment is near its lowest point since reunification, at 7.4 percent as measured by the Federal Employment Agency. While the rate has been falling for several years, Germans were unsettled by changes to labor laws and are only now feeling secure enough to spend, Mr. Harjes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Structural reforms created a lot of uncertainty,'' Mr. Harjes said. ''People weren't confident enough to see there are also opportunities.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING - At a time when many airlines are filing for bankruptcy or consolidating routes, George Weinmann is jumping into the industry with a start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinmann, the chief executive of Mega Maldives Airlines, is going after a growing niche, linking increasingly affluent China with the Maldives, a tiny island nation. The American entrepreneur says he has the right ingredients to make it a success: lucrative landing rights in an expanding market, an international network of contacts and crucial government approvals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the next 10 years, the Maldives can become the playground in the backyard of India and China, similar to the way the Caribbean is to the U.S.A. and Canada,'' Mr. Weinmann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still in its second year, the start-up recently added Chongqing to its network of flights between the Maldivian capital of Male and Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Selling mainly to group tours organized by travel agents, Mega Maldives has grown to about 180 employees, twice the number when flights started in January 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His start-up is all the more ambitious given that the airline industry is hammered by rising fuel prices and cutthroat competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an industry where, even if you make $1 billion one year, you can lose $1 billion another year,'' noted Martin Craigs, who spent most of his career in aviation, but now is chief executive of the Pacific Asia Travel Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mega Maldives has faced its own challenges, particularly after street protests in February, when President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives stepped down - or was forced out in a coup, as he says. China reacted nervously; many carriers canceled flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll keep flying,'' Mr. Weinmann said in February, soon after the unrest hit the islands. ''But for how long, it's hard to say. Right now the planes are still full, but people just aren't booking'' in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath, the airline has suspended only one route, to Hong Kong. Mr. Weinmann said that the full schedule would resume on April 4. He projects that by June, Mega Maldives will expand service to 34 monthly flights from China to the islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His initial plan was to start China's first low-cost carrier, focusing on the fast-growing corridor of Chongqing, Wuhan and Changsha. But after he moved to China, its government decided to curtail private investment in its booming aviation industry. He began investigating alternatives like charter operations, but found few viable options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he finally took a long-postponed honeymoon to the Maldives with his Chinese wife, Wang Beibei, he found his niche. On the last day of his vacation, he met Maldives officials to discuss charter operations from China. But the officials instead proposed that he consider setting up an international airline in the Maldives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a total fluke,'' acknowledged Mr. Weinmann, 37. ''At first we demurred. We know how difficult the airline business is and this time, I did not have the financial backing or the scale of the low-cost business plan I had done before.'' But he and his investors ''kept seeing the demand and the opportunity and finally, we plunged in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roots of the airline can be traced to a business plan competition he participated in while he was at the University of Michigan. Mr. Weinmann, who spent five years at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> as an aerospace engineer, sketched out a plan for a low-cost airline for China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After completing his M.B.A., he visited China for the first time in 2004. An adviser on his business plan, who had worked for an American airline in China, helped arrange a meeting with a top official at the <span class="companylink">Civil Aviation Administration of China</span>, which oversees mainland aviation. Mr. Weinmann, a native of New Orleans, said he received positive feedback on his plan and promptly packed up for China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising seed capital from family and friends, he pitched investors and says he secured $60 million in financing. But he had to abandon the plan when it became clear China would not approve it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years later, he operates in Asia's smallest nation. The Maldives has about 330,000 people on 1,200 islands spread over 35,000 square miles. About 900,000 people visit each year, and Chinese tourists are the largest share of the market. The number of visitors to the Maldives from China doubled in 2010, and soared 67 percent in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mega Maldives began last year with one <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 767 flying from Hong Kong to the Maldives. Service expanded later in the year to Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing. In January of this year, a second 767 was added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinmann is optimistic about the airline's prospects. The International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, projects that international travel from mainland China will rise by around 10 percent annually through 2014, making it the world's fastest-growing market for international flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect to be profitable in 2012, our second full year'' of operation, Mr. Weinmann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinmann has his sights on other markets. He holds stopover rights in China, allowing his airline to continue to other destinations like Japan. Carriers from America and Europe can spend years negotiating routes to China, but Beijing fears no competition from tiny countries like the Maldives. Mr. Weinmann said that the airline had been approved to extend flights to the China-to-Japan corridor and that he planned to add routes to other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mega Maldives has found a nice niche, but there are a lot of challenges,'' said Brendan Sobie, an analyst at the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation's Singapore office. About two dozen airlines serve the Maldives, with Sri Lankan and Emirates in the lead. As the market grows, established competitors with deeper pockets are better positioned to increase flights, Mr. Sobie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinmann, however, said that he believed that start-ups had an advantage because they could typically respond faster to changing conditions. His airline's schedule is part of that advantage, he said. The islands are an expensive destination, and most Chinese visitors come on short breaks. Mega Maldives maximizes their days in the sun by timing the flights to arrive early.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Business 101: find a niche and serve it well,'' he said. ''That's what we have done.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this week's Dashboard, we quoted from a guide to using Pinterest prepared by Jay Ehret, a marketing specialist. As you may have heard, Pinterest is a fast-growing new Web site where users can create sites of photos ''pinned'' from other parts of the Web. We went back to Mr. Ehret with a few questions about how small businesses can use Pinterest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Why do you think Pinterest has become so popular?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: It's brilliant in its simplicity. Users just collect things they like. Simple. Their Pinboards are passively shared with their Pinterest friends, and they can peek in on anyone else's Pinboards. Another big reason is that Pinterest is visual. People are attracted to pictures more than they are words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Which businesses should consider using the service?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: First, those businesses that appeal to women. That doesn't mean a female-oriented business, but businesses that sell to women. This could be an interior design company, or it could be a car dealership. The demographics of Pinterest are so female-skewed that it just makes sense. I would caution you not to limit Pinterest by industry. O.K., maybe funeral homes wouldn't be a great choice, but most businesses would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Is Pinterest just for women?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Of course not, but it's mostly for women. It's estimated that 70 percent of Pinterest users are female. Some guys are jumping in now, but it will remain mostly a female platform for the near future. Women just tend to use social media more than men. Even as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has matured, 55 percent of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users are female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How do you determine if Pinterest may be right for your business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Can you answer yes to these questions: One, do you have, or can you create, interesting and sharable content on your Web site? Two, do you have products to sell that can be presented visually? Three, are you willing to devote the time that it takes to market on Pinterest? Businesses are lured into social media marketing because it's free. But the primary investment in social media marketing is time, not money. If you are not willing to devote the time to Pinterest, or any other social media, it's not right for your business. It must be a scheduled business activity, just like opening the doors or doing payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What are the risks of using Pinterest versus other social media sites?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Everyone keeps talking about copyright issues. So I guess the big risk is that Pinterest might be shut down one day because of copyright violations, or Pinterest would be forced to change the functionality and severely limit the way Pinners use the service. The other risk is that, like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, you don't own your Pinterest account. So you are at the mercy of a third party. This is why it's always good for a business to have their own Web site and own real estate on the Internet.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has changed since Karen Mills, the administrator for the Small Business Administration, first sat down with us back in the fall of 2009. The economy is improving, unemployment is falling, and S.B.A. lending is back to pre-recession levels. Ms. Mills's agency, however, still faces pressing challenges. Fewer S.B.A. loans are reaching the smallest, underserved businesses. And both the agency and the Obama administration are under intense pressure to show that they are creating jobs, even as the White House proposes new cuts to the S.B.A. budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, The Agenda sat down with Ms. Mills once more to discuss some of these issues - and to ask her questions submitted by You're the Boss readers. What follows is a condensed version of that conversation. Special thanks to the readers who submitted questions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Cooper wrote to share his suspicions of guaranteeing bank loans to small businesses: ''It goes without saying that if a commercial bank loan needs an S.B.A. guarantee, then it must not be too creditworthy to begin with.'' What is the S.B.A.'s mission in lending?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our role is to provide access and opportunity. Let's say you are a really good small business, and the banks says the last two years have been a little tough, you don't quite meet my standards, but I'd like to give you the loan. That's when they use the S.B.A. guarantee. And these loans actually perform really well. Our loss rate is really 2 percentage points higher than the average of all losses. So for the risk we are taking, these are people who should get credit but the market is not functioning perfectly. And that is where we step in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael J. Knight, an accountant in Fairfield, Conn., asks, ''Why isn't there a streamlined application for businesses that invest in getting it right -- such as by meeting regularly with accountants, preparing monthly financial statements, establishing internal controls? They don't get any more consideration by the S.B.A. than the guy who has no books and uses Score to prepare his loan application.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have a streamlined loan application now really for everyone - we want everybody to be able to do it well. That is why we have Score representatives, that is why we have Small Business Development Centers, and we can help a small business who may not have the experience to prepare a banking package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody complains about the paperwork on S.B.A. loans - why does the process take so long?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our turnaround time for loans is 10 days. The paperwork is actually not very much -- and we have taken it down. Our CapLines program -- which we just redid -- had 46 forms. Now it has eight, and they are optional. What takes the time is the small business preparing the application, answering questions. And that is why I say, go first to one of our counselors -- remember they're free. Spend the time getting yourself ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you hear these stories - one loan broker told us that if he takes a client for an S.B.A. loan, it takes at least 11 weeks to close. But if he takes a client to a community bank, it's four weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think that would be substantiated overall. Banks are working with mostly their own documents. There is not a major set of incremental documents for the S.B.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will counselors really help you with the loan documents?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absolutely. For example, in the height of the crisis, when a lot of people were getting turned down by their banks, our North Carolina Small Business Technical Development Center said, ''Everybody who's rejected, you come to us, and we will work with you on the bank package.'' They got 70 percent of them creditworthy. And then when they got before the banker, they had success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Austad tweeted a question on microlending - he'd like to know about average terms, rates, and requirements, and length of time typical for the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have 120-odd active microlenders all over the country. We put capital into these microlenders and they lend it and they relend it. We give them a very good rate - one, one-and-a-quarter percent - that's a discount off the market rates. They then pick the rate that they make the microloan at, and they set the timing. And the amount of money microlenders have to lend went from around $120 million in 2008 to $340 million now. But in microlending, it's not just the money. They provide an enormous amount of technical assistance. Failure rates for start-ups are high, and the more we can reduce the failure rate, the more jobs we have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why then is the Obama administration proposing to cut technical assistance for microlending by about 20 percent from 2010, especially if the pool of capital has grown?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we have done is instead of a silo - like microlending technical assistance only going to microloans - we have created an entire network of our women's centers, which are in these same communities; our Small Business Development Centers; our Score representatives all now linked, leveraged, and aligned on the ground. A small business needs to have seamless access. We want them to walk through any door, whether it's an S.B.A. door, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and find their way to our loan program, find their way to a counselor who can solve the kinds of questions, needs and frustrations that your readers have. So looking at numbers in silos does not necessarily give you the best bang for the taxpayer's buck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is the S.B.A. making fewer small 7(a) loans than in years past and why is the average loan size bigger?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a great question, because S.B.A. had a record year. We are back to above the 2008 levels of lending in dollars, but there's still a gap, as you point out. Small-dollar loans to under-served communities are not back. The big banks, which made a very large number of the small loans in 2005, 2006, and 2007, withdrew from the market. And now we have to bring them back into the market, and we have to reach into other really viable lenders who will be more in touch with some of these underserved communities. So that is why we gave every partner that we've got on-the-ground access to the S.B.A. guarantees through a program we have called Community Advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't think it's because of the way Congress and the S.B.A. have ratcheted up the size standards for small companies, making bigger companies eligible for the loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. We know why lenders are not making these loans. They pulled back from the small loan market in large numbers during the crisis, because of the risk. And now coming back in, it's just as costly to make a small loan as a big loan. They're coming back in for the big loans first, which are more profitable, and we have pushed them to come back to the small loan market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody calls the new JOBS Act, which has the enthusiastic backing of President Obama, a small-business bill, but its main provision is designed to help companies with up to $1 billion in revenue. How is a billion-dollar company small?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Congress has worked through a number of these parameters. I wouldn't want you to think that, whatever the parameters in this particular bill, they are going to be the same as they are going to have at the S.B.A. on other things. But a lot of the cost of an I.P.O. is associated with some of the reporting. Small businesses clearly don't have that free cash flow and staff, and there is a fair bit of consensus around the notion of an on-ramp, a middle ground that you can stage these requirements and still give investors adequate information flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This works on the very, very high-growth companies. The data shows that some of these high-growth companies add most of their employees after they go public. Instead now, there is a lot of academic documentation about how these same companies are getting bought, and that they don't then grow as individual entities. You have to make sure the door is open for a very, very accelerated growth rate. And that's a public market.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erica Molina was standing where she usually stands at lunchtime, in the middle of her 116 square feet -- an irregularly shaped booth in the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side. She was talking about the $5,000 loan that had allowed her to buy the counter she was leaning on and the used refrigerator behind her when a delivery arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a box marked ''electric griddle.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, too. ''For quesadillas,'' she explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Molina and her business partner, Jesse Kramer, turned to an unconventional source for the money to keep their Brooklyn Taco Company food stand afloat last year: Accion East, an arm of a nonprofit microlender that specializes in small loans to entrepreneurs who, like Ms. Molina and Mr. Kramer, have not been in business long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microlending, pioneered by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, has surged in the United States in recent years. As credit markets seized up and the recession deepened -- and as credit card companies tightened their rules, because many startups add substantial balances on the owners' credit cards -- microlenders provided cash infusions to keep small businesses from going under. Gina Harman, the chief executive of Accion, the US Network, which is the parent of Accion East, said the typical loan totaled $7,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Harman said that Accion had arranged nearly 13,000 loans totaling more than $94.5 million in the New York region in the 21 years it has been in business. Roughly 80 percent of the money went to immigrants or minorities, Ms. Harman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These loans, on average, create two and a half jobs, which is consistent with the fact that the small business sector has been the only sector to contribute net increases in the last 10 years,'' she said. ''So when a small business is supported, the business generates revenue, it becomes part of the tax base and it adds to the stability in communities and employment, which makes a $7,000 loan a pretty efficient tool for driving the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By a bank loan officer's standards, $7,000 is almost microscopic -- except, perhaps, as the unpaid balance on a much larger loan. But Ms. Harman has taken her small-business mantra to the heart of big business: On a recent Wednesday, she rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange as part of the announcement of a job-growth program called the NYSE Big StartUp. With it, Accion started a job-growth fund with a $1.5 million commitment from <span class="companylink">NYSE Euronext</span>. The Big StartUp calls for bigger businesses to lend support and resources to startups and small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock exchange program is aimed at opening doors, which is what Ms. Molina said Accion East had done for Brooklyn Taco. The loan, she said, ''helped us build credit and let other creditors know we are people who pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn Taco already owed <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> $10,000 from a loan with a 7 percent interest rate. Ms. Molina said that before she found Accion, she had sold her apartment and had been using that money to keep Brooklyn Taco going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all lenders, microlenders look at an applicant's credit score and history when deciding whether to approve a loan. Before the recession, the average credit score of an Accion customer was below 600, Ms. Harman said. In 2008, Accion set a minimum credit score of 575, in part to minimize the risk to Accion's own portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a way of focusing on businesses that could afford to take on additional debt and provide the right support sources for those who couldn't,'' Ms. Harman said. ''There needed to be a way to separate one from the other. The credit score helped us do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Ms. Harman said, Accion's borrowers had been more dependable than many bank borrowers. In 2011, she said, Accion's delinquency rate was 4 percent in New York City. ''Banks build their models on 25 percent,'' said Ms. Harman, who was a community advocate and a union organizer in her 20s before becoming the president of the consumer division of a company her father had started, <span class="companylink">Harman International</span>, which included the <span class="companylink">Harman Kardon</span> brand of audio equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many banks, microlenders like Accion happily make loans to home-based businesses, as Alicia Piller discovered when she started selling her costume jewelry and hand-painted clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's scary to me to get a loan from a bank,'' said Ms. Piller, who started her business in her apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and recently moved to Prospect Park South. ''Banks are like the scary monster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Molina said her next dream was to open a restaurant in Vermont, or maybe in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why Vermont? she was asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's about two hours from Montreal,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montreal? What is so special about Montreal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Butter,'' she said. ''Great butter. It's creamier. I just want to have it. We don't even use it here, but I have a personal preference for croissants.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't they ever learn? Large bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate have now passed the deeply flawed JOBS Act and President Obama is expected to sign it soon. The full name is equally seductive: Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act. What it is is an invitation to a fresh round of financial malfeasance. It rolls back important investor safeguards from the post-Enron Sarbanes-Oxley law and the post-financial crisis Dodd-Frank law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official justification for the legislation -- debunked in experttestimony -- is that rules on disclosure, accounting and auditing make it unduly difficult for new companies to raise money by issuing stock. The real driving force behind the bill is the eagerness of politicians in both parties to please bankers and business executives who relentlessly demand deregulation and have the deep pockets to get their way, especially in an election year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drive to deregulate doesn't stop there. Bipartisan majorities in the House passed twomore damaging bills last week that would undercut provisions in Dodd-Frank to rein in derivatives, the complex financial instruments at the heart of the financial crisis. The bills' supporters say the measures are mere technical corrections. In fact, they are aimed at limiting regulators' ability to police derivatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more egregious of the two would exempt a swath of derivatives transactions from almost all Dodd-Frank regulation -- including reforms to enhance transparency and deter fraud. At issue are deals that occur between bank affiliates, as opposed to between banks and their clients. Such transactions can be routine and harmless, or complex and risky. Current law gives regulators the authority to decide which ones require scrutiny, but the House bill would broadly exempt the deals from regulation -- in effect, replacing regulators' authority with a statutory ban on regulatory oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two more measures to shield banks from derivatives regulation could come to the House floor in the next months. One would water down pending rules to require that most derivatives be traded on open exchanges, rather than as private contracts between banks and clients. Exchange trading is a vital step toward a stable and transparent market, but banks oppose it because it would reduce the fees they earn from dealing in the dark. Another bill would let the banks avoid Dodd-Frank regulation by conducting derivatives deals through foreign subsidiaries, a loophole that would virtually invite banks to engage in unregulated transactions on a potentially vast scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless President Obama changes his mind, the JOBS Act is a done deal. And sooner or later, investors will be harmed by its heedless weakening of important protections. Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama can still stop the attempted rollback of derivatives' regulation. They need to refresh their memories about how the country got into the financial mess -- before it happens again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act will create jobs or only encourage fraud is open to debate, but one thing is clear: this piece of legislation is a reminder that Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are completely inept at regulating our financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act is an annoyingly named piece of legislation that purports to create jobs partly by seeking to increase the number of initial public offerings. Companies with up to $1 billion in revenue are labeled emerging growth companies and relieved of disclosure and other securities law requirements for their first five years after going public.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The act also does a number of other things that are wholly unrelated to encouraging I.P.O.'s but intended to make fund-raising easier for companies. Most prominently it allows for so-called crowdfunding. Companies will be permitted to raise up to $1 million through mass, online solicitations via the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents argue that these changes will unleash the markets from overregulation brought about by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Critics are calling this the bucket shop act of 2012. They claim that the JOBS Act undoes important reforms to discourage fraud, prompted by the Enron and WorldCom scandals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who's right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, we really just don't know, and this uncertainty is a sad reminder of what a sausage factory Congress is. Congress simply doesn't understand financial markets and instead legislates to the political winds. It is very likely that Congress may have adopted the JOBS Act based on the wrong premise and may end up hurting, rather than helping, markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for initial public offerings is already fairly robust. The United States has the largest number of offerings so far this year, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is smaller offerings that have been in decline over the years. But the decline of small offerings most likely has very little to do with the changes wrought by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Grant Thornton, an accounting and consulting firm that has studied the I.P.O. market found that in 1996, the number of offerings raising less than $25 million was 309, which declined to nine by 2001, a year before Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grant Thornton asserts that the decline is a result of changes in market structure. One reason is decimalization - pricing stocks in cents rather than fractions - that took profits out of trading that had previously given brokers an incentive to list small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But special interests, including the Business Roundtable, were able to tie the decline in small I.P.O.'s to Sarbanes-Oxley and disclosure requirements that were too demanding. Congress bought this argument despite the lack of hard evidence. By doing so, Congress actually ignored evidence that a similar deregulation of foreign issuers in the last decade led to the scandal involving Chinese reverse I.P.O.'s. The Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking to re-regulate that market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a real risk that Congress's actions could harm the market. People pay more for American stocks than they would for those in other countries because we have enhanced antifraud rules. If investors lose faith in the United States market, stocks may decline in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for market structure, the likely reason for the decline in small I.P.O.'s, Congress directed the S.E.C. to study and report whether the stock price of emerging growth companies should be quoted in increments from 1 cent to 10 cents. The commission can then make rules to force shares to be quoted in higher spreads than 1 cent per share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But making people pay more for these shares would be about as popular as raising the gasoline tax. Congress gave the S.E.C. discretion to make this decision, latitude the agency is likely to use to avoid taking such a step, particularly because it opposes large parts of the JOBS Act. In other words, lawmakers sidestepped the really difficult decimalization issue, leaving it to the regulators in a way almost intended for nothing to happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas, Congress also enacted unworkable reforms. The best example is the crowdfunding provision. At the last minute, the Senate amended this provision, ostensibly to enhance fraud protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing so, Congress made the provisions hard to use. Crowdfunding companies will have to raise money through Internet platforms in small individual amounts, less than $2,000 for most Americans. If a company raises more than $500,000 it will have to prepare audited financials. This is a huge expense that will discourage most companies from resorting to crowdfunding for significant amounts of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding is an interesting experiment and has the potential to democratize fund-raising. But it really is just an experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress would have been better off leaving it to the S.E.C. to design and run such an experiment, allowing the commission to tweak the crowdfunding mechanism in light of market developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the iffy supporting evidence, the whole JOBS Act is an experiment. For this reason, Prof. John C. Coates IV of Harvard Law School has recommended that the terms of the act have a two- or three-year sunset provision allowing for renewal if the provisions are found to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead this legislation took on the aura of a must-pass to give the illusion Congress was creating jobs. That is why we are getting a major deregulatory bill so soon after the financial crisis. The JOBS Act succeeded because it took the public interest forces by surprise, being pushed out of the House before the problems with the bill could be highlighted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is infuriating. If Congress makes a decision based on uncertain facts, then it is using its judgment and doing what we elect them to do. But here the facts, evidence and what was best for the markets simply did not matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tinkering with a multitrillion-dollar market based on sentiment is unlikely to create jobs and help our markets. It is merely foolish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not just a Republican or Democratic issue. The JOBS Act was passed with bipartisan support. Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley were similarly flawed. In those acts, Congress made decisions about our financial markets without even reading or considering the actual facts at hand and often legislated in a manner intended to fail. For another illustration, you only need to look at the travails of the agencies trying to issue the Volcker Rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is both a pro-business and pro-consumer issue. Congress seems to get both the reform part and the raising standards part wrong as special interests control the agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best thing Congress could do for securities regulation in the future is to take a break for a few years and focus on naming post offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at a time when the mobile start-up Instagram can command $1 billion in a sale to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, some start-ups are asking: Who needs the Web?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smartphones are everywhere now, allowing apps like Foursquare and Path to be self-contained social worlds, existing almost entirely on mobile devices. It is a major change from just a few years ago, underscoring how the momentum in the tech world is shifting to mobile from computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that context, the Instagram deal looks like something of a turning point, as even the Web giant <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> tries to get a better grasp on a market that requires a rethinking of old rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For decades, the center of computing has been the desktop, and software was modeled after the experience of using a typewriter,'' said Georg Petschnigg, a former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> employee who is one of the creators of Paper, a new sketchbook app for the iPad. ''But technology is now more intimate and pervasive than that. We have it with us all the time, and we have to reimagine innovative new interfaces and experiences around that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists are eager to get in on the mobile trend. According to the research firm CB Insights, mobile apps and companies attracted 10 percent of the total investment dollars from American venture capital firms in last year's fourth quarter, and 12 percent of deals were mobile-related, up from 7 or 8 percent in previous quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Lerer, manager of the venture capital firm Lerer Ventures, said he preferred to back companies that were building services for mobile first and the Web second, because ''businesses that are thinking that way are planning for the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lerer was one of the early investors in OMGPop, a New York company that was close to shutting down until it had an overnight hit in Draw Something, a twist on Pictionary for the iPhone. Last month, OMGPop was snapped up for $200 million by the game company <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, which has been trying to reduce its dependence on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>-based games like FarmVille.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another hit game, Angry Birds from the Finnish company Rovio, started out on the iPhone before migrating to computers and video game consoles -- an unusual trajectory in the game world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cellphones are also prompting a shift in how people want to share things online, creating a market for apps that make instant sharing easy, said S. Shyam Sundar, a director of the Media Effects Research Lab at Pennsylvania State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, many people want to post a photograph of themselves right from a sun-drenched beach in Bali, rather than waiting until they are back home to upload all 50 pictures onto <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are living in the moment and they want to share in the moment,'' Professor Sundar said. ''Mobile gives you that immediacy and convenience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instagram, a social network focusing on just that kind of instant photo sharing, does have a Web site -- but it is essentially there just to encourage people to download the company's apps. It is one of several social networks that have established themselves entirely on mobile. Another is Foursquare, which lets users share their location with a select few friends and has attracted nearly 15 million members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mobile-first is the direction that many social networks are headed,'' said Holger Luedorf, the company's head of business development. If done right, he said, such services start to feel ''baked into'' the phone itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Morin, who was at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> early on and left to create Path, a social network for mobile phones, said he realized that the world was headed for a mobile-centric future in 2009, when the influential analyst Mary Meeker published a report saying that more people would soon connect to the Internet on mobile devices than on personal computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Path does not release user numbers, but its app appears to have traction, particularly among people who have become disenchanted with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. ''Because you take your smartphone with you everywhere, you can quickly and easily take a photo or video, map your location or jot down a note or a thought,'' Mr. Morin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that start with a Web site then try to shrink it into an app face a tough challenge. Screen space on mobile devices is at a premium. And to avoid turning off users, designers and developers have to cut back on clutter and streamline their services, avoiding slow load times and stuttering interruptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-ups that put their resources into mobile from the beginning can skip some of the hassles. ''You're freed from worrying about so many of the things that you have to think about when it comes to Web development,'' said Oliver Cameron, one of the founders of Everyme, an app introduced Tuesday that analyzes a user's contacts and generates miniature social networks around people it thinks belong together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the relative ease in finding an audience. Web sites and software packages have trouble standing out in the crowd. But apps have a simple distribution mechanism in app stores, which can immediately bring an app to a customer's attention. ''In February we had close to 900,000 downloads,'' said Andreas Schobel, chief executive of Catch, a start-up in San Francisco that makes a note-taking app. ''How would we do that on the Web?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mobile apps tailored to work for specific devices like the iPhone also run faster than Web sites, Mr. Schobel noted. ''When you're on the phone you need the experience to be instantaneous,'' he said. ''You just can't do that yet on the Web.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes are never popular, especially in April of an election year. But the Republicans' latest effort to tilt the tax code in favor of the wealthy, and starve the government of needed revenue, is particularly cynical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the House Republican leadership is expected to bring up the ''Small Business Tax Cut Act,'' a bill to let most business owners deduct up to 20 percent of their business income in 2012 -- a $46 billion tax cut. Despite the Mom-and-Pop label, it is designed so that nearly half of the tax cut would go to people with annual income over $1 million, and more than four-fifths would go to those making over $200,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill's proponents, led by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, say that lower taxes would lead to more hiring. But the economic reality is that employers, big and small, are hesitant to hire because of slow or uncertain demand for their products and services, not because of their tax burden. And companies would receive the tax cut even if they did not hire new workers -- making it a windfall, not an incentive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill is predicated on an overly broad definition of ''small business'' -- one with fewer than 500 employees, which can include multimillion-dollar partnerships and corporations. It is also based on a willful denial of the reality that small businesses are not the big job creators politicians often say they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If ''small'' were set at 50 employees, small businesses would be credited with creating less than a third of the new jobs over the last 20 years. And many such jobs are soon lost as small businesses struggle or fail. The best way to encourage their success is with continued government spending to support demand and by building a well-regulated banking system that is not prone to the busts that devastate small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the broader economy, the Congressional Budget Office analyzed 13 policies last year for their potential impact on economic growth and job creation in 2012 and 2013. The option of a business tax cut along the lines of the Cantor bill ranked next to last in bang for the buck. More effective options include fiscal aid to states and increased safety net spending, which create jobs by bolstering consumer demand -- and which Republicans fiercely oppose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another immediate step Congress could take to create demand and jobs would be for House Republicans to drop their objections and reauthorize the highway bill, at least for two years, as the Senate has done. That would help private-sector contractors and suppliers, as well as government workers, boosting local businesses in areas where jobs are created. Extending the research and development tax credit would also help some businesses, but Senate Republicans have blocked that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business tax cut for not-so-small businesses will almost certainly pass the House. Senate Democrats have introduced a tax relief bill that is linked specifically to companies hiring new employees. They should stick with that. This doesn't mean that the tax system doesn't need fixing. It does. In the Senate this week, the Democratic leadership will make an argument for more fairness, by calling for a vote on the Buffett Rule. It would require the wealthiest taxpayers to pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes and, in the process, raise some $47 billion over 10 years. Republican senators are expected to block the vote. When you mail your taxes this week, think about that.</p>

But the chief issue remained unsettled: how to pay the cost of doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second day of campaign-style rallies, Mr. Obama pressed his attack on Republicans, depicting them as unsympathetic to college students in need. Republicans countered by accusing the president and his Democratic allies of playing politics with the issue and trying to raise taxes on small businesses to pay for the subsidized rate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caught in the middle were seven million college students who will see the interest rate on their federally subsidized loans double to 6.8 percent on July 1 unless Congress and the White House come together on a plan to prevent that, at a cost of $6 billion. For a typical student, the White House said the higher rate could mean as much as $1,000 in additional debt per year at a time of high unemployment among recent graduates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has made the issue his top talking point in recent days as part of an effort to put Republicans on the defensive and duplicate the political success of the payroll tax cut extension last winter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the economy,'' Mr. Obama said with indignation in his voice. ''What economy are they talking about? You are the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans were equally indignant at what they saw as game-playing, saying that they, too, want to forestall the rate increase. They quickly tried to outmaneuver the president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Boehner hastily called a news conference to announce that the House would vote Friday on a student loan bill that seemed to take shape just as suddenly. The proposal would extend the current interest rate for federal student loans for one year. The $6 billion cost would be offset by eliminating the remainder of the money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a portion of the health care law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know, this week the president's traveling the country on the taxpayers' dime,'' Mr. Boehner said, ''campaigning and trying to invent a fight where there isn't one and never has been one on this issue of student loans. We can and will fix the problem without a bunch of campaign-style theatrics. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Democrats quickly countered that they would offer a bill to maintain the rate by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress first cut the interest rate on federally subsidized loans in 2007 when Democrats controlled both houses but allowed the cuts to expire after five years because of the cost. The rate moved down gradually each year to 3.4 percent last summer from a high of 6.8 percent. If no action is taken, the rate will jump back up to 6.8 percent this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama included money in his budget to extend the cut, but just for one year. Republicans, in the budget advanced by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, did not finance an extension. But following the lead of Mitt Romney, the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Republican leaders say they, too, favor extending the lower rate at least temporarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It took me seven years to work my way through college, working every job I could get my hands on,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''And what Washington shouldn't be doing is exploiting the challenges that young Americans face for political gain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials said the only reason Republicans were speaking out in support was because the president had embarrassed them, and they pointed to a number of past comments by individual members of the opposition questioning the government role in student loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, introduced a bill to extend the cuts and pay for that extension by preventing some business owners from sheltering their income from Medicare and Social Security taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He plans to hold a vote to try to overcome a potential filibuster, most likely after next week's recess, giving Mr. Obama a chance to talk about the issue all next week, Democrats said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, responded with legislation introduced Wednesday to keep the low rate and pay for it by taking money from Mr. Obama's health care program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each plan was devised in a way to make it unpalatable for the other party to vote for it, thus setting the stage for a potentially protracted fight over how to finance the student loan measure. It was a reflection of the fact that Republicans do not want to have the fight Mr. Obama seemed eager for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sounds to me that they know this is not someplace where they want to go,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, who sponsored the original 2007 legislation. ''So I think it really is down to how we will pay for it. In this economy at a time when families are struggling and people are concerned about the load of debt, it makes no sense to charge students 6.8 percent.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS may be little consolation to recent graduates who have sent out dozens of resumes with nary a response; who have been turned down for unpaid internships; who have vast amounts of student debt to repay as they continue in jobs as baby sitters and waiters.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But employers say they will hire 10.2 percent more college graduates from the class of 2012 than they did from the class of 2011, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nuggets of news like this are welcome as the economy fitfully recovers. Even so, joblessness among the young remains at crisis levels, economists say. In April, the unemployment rate for workers under age 25 was 16.4 percent, compared with 8.1 percent over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those with only some college, or with high school degrees or less, are the worst off. But ''every way you cut it -- by race or gender, with or without a college degree -- young people are just not getting the job opportunities they need, and it will have a lasting impact on their careers,'' said Heidi Shierholz, an economist who studies the labor market at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one wants to see millions of young people sitting idle. So what can be done? Can policies and programs be created to channel them into full-time jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those questions are entangled in certain truths about the political process. Teachers have the American Federation of Teachers. Gun owners have the N.R.A. The older population has AARP. But where are the advocacy groups for jobless youth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are coming. Two movements have sprouted to fight for this generation's right to move out of the parental basement (or avoid it altogether): the Campaign for Young America and Fix Young America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, they are the younger siblings of Occupy Wall Street, but with a nonpartisan agenda, more centralized leadership and one specific mission: to help young people find jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Occupy represented this bottled-up energy and frustration -- it was the manifestation that our generation will not be able to reach the American dream,'' said Aaron Smith, 30, co-founder of Young Invincibles, a nonprofit group based in Washington that is the force behind the Campaign for Young America. ''Now we are trying to harness that energy into something tangible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Campaign for Young America is in the midst of a 21-state bus tour that is set to conduct 100 round tables with young people, Occupy Wall Street protesters, community leaders and entrepreneurs. ''One thing we are really focused on is trying to better connect colleges and universities to local employers,'' Mr. Smith said. Later this year, the group will endorse specific policy recommendations based on input during the round tables, and host candidate forums, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fix Young America is supported by members of the nonprofit Young Entrepreneur Council, based in New York. (Officially the new group has a hashtag in front of its name, to reflect its presence on Twitter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group assembled more than two-dozen people -- including Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, university leaders and entrepreneurs -- to offer prescriptions for solving youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ideas were required to have a track record. ''Anyone and their mother could come up with ideas, but what we wanted to do with Fix Young America was to get the strongest voices in the room, the ones who showed there was proof in the pudding,'' said Scott Gerber, 28, founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council and Fix Young America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solutions will be published Wednesday in a book. Mr. Smith, for one, wrote a chapter advocating student loan forgiveness for entrepreneurs who start businesses that create jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another solution was proposed by Zach Sims, whose chapter focuses on teaching young people JavaScript, the computer programming language. ''There are a limited number of things you can do with an English degree,'' said Mr. Sims, 21, co-founder of Codecademy, a free Web site that teaches programming and coding. ''Coding skills are such a clear path to employment, regardless of your background.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sims suggests teaching coding nationally via sites like Codecademy and creating partnerships with high schools, colleges and local government. He wants to start a ''national programming movement'' and recently formed a partnership with the White House for a summer program to teach coding to underprivileged youth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTHER Fix Young America solutions have already been road-tested on a state level. Senator Wyden's idea is to expand the Self-Employment Assistance Program, an obscure government program that allows laid-off people to collect unemployment benefits while they start a business. (Regular unemployment insurance requires that a recipient actively search for work.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Wyden says the program, which is optional and used only by a handful of states, is one way to unstack the deck against young people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Lowry, 32, and Michael Richardson, 26, took advantage of the program in Oregon, one state that offers it. In May 2009, the two were laid off from their jobs as software engineers (one of those supposedly safe careers) at a start-up in Portland. They both applied for unemployment benefits, but they really wanted to start a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they found out about the self-employment program, they submitted the business plan for their company, a mobile services provider for app developers. Over six months (the maximum time allowed) they each received around $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a great solution because we could concentrate on building our business instead of finding contract work,'' Mr. Lowry said. Today their company, <span class="companylink">Urban Airship</span>, has 75 employees and has raised millions in venture funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are growing like a weed,'' Mr. Lowry said, ''and the money we got from the Self-Employment Assistance Program was critical. It paid our rent, food and bills, which were really the main expenses because we bought the computers and server space on credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Yang, another member of Fix Young America, says more college graduates should be steered toward fast-growing companies. He is founder of Venture for America, a nonprofit based in New York that places graduates from top-tier schools at start-ups in cities like Las Vegas and Cincinnati.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is to create 100,000 jobs by 2025,'' he said. ''We think job creation is pretty straightforward: you supply early-stage growth companies in lower-cost cities with talent so they can grow and hire more people, and then you train your best and brightest to become innovators.'' Putting it another way, Mr. Yang said, ''If you send a Brown University graduate to <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, is that person going to create jobs?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture for America says it works only with companies that have demonstrated the ability to create jobs. The companies pay a salary, $32,000 to $38,000 a year, during a two-year Venture for America fellowship. The first class of Venture for America fellows will graduate in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten fellows are being hired by the Downtown Project, a $350 million effort to revitalize downtown Las Vegas. The project is largely financed by Tony Hsieh, C.E.O. of the online shoe company Zappos, which is based in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the Ivy League bubble, Nick Friedman, 29, wants to do something about the unemployment rate among veterans -- 9.2 percent for those returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. He is co-founder of College Hunks Hauling Junk, a moving and rubbish removal company based in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Friedman, another member of Fix Young America, says one way to help veterans is through franchising. His company hopes to attract more veterans by offering financial incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Franchises really just require the right leaders to implement strategy and lead. Military personnel have that same training in terms of executing a game plan and leading a team,'' Mr. Friedman said. Federal legislation is in the pipeline to create a tax credit for franchise businesses owned by veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen whether these solutions will make a dent in youth joblessness. Many of them stress entrepreneurship, and not everyone wants to be involved in a start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Szymanski, 22, a senior at Rowan University in New Jersey who is majoring in political science and minoring in journalism, says he is concerned about finding a job in public relations when he graduates in December, but he doesn't want to strike out on his own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right out of college, I want to get my feet on the ground and work for someone else,'' he said. ''I've already taken a big enough risk by taking out $20,000 in loans to go to college.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shierholz, of the Economic Policy Institute, said that what was really needed was more financial stimulus from the government to create jobs. ''That would move the dial on youth unemployment in a speedy fashion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE two new groups have attracted lawmakers' attention in this election year. Last month, Mr. Gerber, along with other entrepreneurs, spoke in front of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, emphasizing ways to help young veterans and advocating loan forgiveness for young entrepreneurs. Michael J. Ference, senior policy adviser for Eric Cantor, who is a Republican of Virginia and the House majority leader, later met with Mr. Gerber to discuss ways to work with the campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative McHenry said that he did not agree with all of his fellow contributors to the Fix Young America book, but that the idea of proposing solutions attracted him. ''It's young people with innovative ideas who are going to reform and restructure our economy,'' he said. His chapter deals with crowdfunding, which allows the public to invest in start-up companies through the Internet. (Legislation allowing crowdfunding was recently passed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both campaigns stress social media as part of their message, for example by asking for solutions on Twitter and their Web sites. But they are also mobilizing on the ground. Last month, thousands of college students turned out on more than 300 campuses for Fix Young America rallies. They were trying to gain the support not of politicians but of Stephen Colbert, host of ''The Colbert Report'' on <span class="companylink">Comedy Central</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He is known as the Oprah of Gen Y,'' Mr. Gerber said. ''He brings attention to major injustices through humor and satire and that's what resonates with my generation.'' (Mr. Colbert has not indicated whether he will back the effort.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Colbert is a satirist of right-wing politics, Fix Young America itself says it is nonpartisan. ''We didn't want to be held hostage by political rhetoric and agendas,'' Mr. Gerber said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Gerber, Mr. Smith said the Campaign for Young America did not want to align itself with either political party, because concerns about youth unemployment cut across party lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both Democrats and Republicans need to listen and respond to the concerns of our generation,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT - When Next Alternative, a Canadian start-up, wanted to raise money a few years ago, it opted for a listing on a new offshoot of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. As part of the bourse's so-called First Quotation Board, the six-month-old start-up could tap investors for capital without the higher costs, stricter disclosure requirements and other regulatory hurdles of an offering on the main exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Next Alternative has to find another home. The owner of the stock exchange, Deutsche Borse, is closing the unregulated market in December after a number of dubious parties used it to defraud investors. The situation has left hundreds of small companies, including Next Alternative, scrambling to qualify for the next level of the market or face delisting.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Deutsche Borse's requirements were way too lenient, and it ruined things for everybody else,'' said Robert Ireland, the chief executive of Next Alternative, which had about 11 million Canadian dollars in revenue in 2011. Mr. Ireland is working with his company's Frankfurt-based advisers to apply for a listing on another exchange affiliated with Deutsche Borse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The First Quotation Board, which opened in 2008, was intended to give small companies fast, cost-efficient access to capital markets. With little oversight, the exchange didn't require companies to file a prospectus or have revenue in order to trade. A year later, roughly 400 companies in Germany and elsewhere had flocked to the platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the exchange also attracted a fair share of dubious activity. Last year, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, conducted 166 investigations, a ''large majority'' of which involved companies on the First Quotation Board, according to Regina Schierhorn, the head of market manipulation at BaFin. An inquiry has ensnared Next Alternative, although the company and its chief executive have not been implicated of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It goes back to how frustrating it is to be listed in Frankfurt, where the rules change continuously,'' Mr. Ireland said. ''We had wanted to get our feet wet in the public market and be present in Europe, but the listing hasn't benefited us at all.'' Mr. Ireland added that he was not aware of the investigation into manipulation of Next Alternative's shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, the regulator said, swindlers used the exchange to operate a ''pump and dump'' scheme. Brokers working in Asia, Britain, Canada and Germany would promote certain stocks, either by cold-calling prospective investors or through an orchestrated media campaign, according to Ms. Schierhorn. The fraud schemes usually focused on investments in hot sectors like commodities or nanotechnology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By combining tips from investors who felt scammed with suspicious patterns in order books, we got a hint that much activity on the First Quotation Board was based on pump-and-dump strategies, like it can happen with pink sheets in the United States,'' said Michael Zollweg, the head of the Frankfurt exchange's trading oversight board, which works closely with BaFin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hulbee, a search engine start-up in Switzerland, claims to be a victim of such activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the company's chief executive, Andreas Wiebe, said he was approached by two German men in Bonn who offered to help his fledgling Internet company raise money by joining the First Quotation Board. The men persuaded Mr. Wiebe to give them 17.5 percent of the company in exchange for their consulting services and a planned investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Wiebe focused on expanding the company, he said the two men prepared the necessary documentation and got Hulbee, then called Grossbay, registered on the First Quotation Board. Soon after, the two men, through a call center in Dusseldorf, started heavily publicizing Hulbee to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Wiebe, they pitched the potential of the company, which had no revenue at that point, as a rival to <span class="companylink">Google</span> and misrepresented themselves as company executives. Shares reached a peak in July 2009, but by the end of that year, they had dropped 75 percent. The shares now trade around 30 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials are still pursuing the ostensible manipulation of shares in Hulbee, and Mr. Wiebe is not a focus of the investigation, said Claudia Krauth, the chief public prosecutor in Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wiebe said, ''The whole affair took two years of my life. When I look back, I can hardly believe our company survived.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As such problems started to emerge, regulators and prosecutors tried to crack down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, a court in Munich convicted Tobias Bosler, a former official of an association to protect small shareholders, on 47 counts of market manipulation. Other cases are working their way through the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bourse, too, tried to curb fraud. In the fall of 2011, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange removed 126 companies from the First Quotation Board. But ''it wasn't enough to end the systematic abuse,'' said Mr. Zollweg, who headed up the efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in February, the exchange opted to close the First Quotation Board. The remaining 448 companies listed there will have to meet the higher requirements of the next level of the market, the Entry Standard Board, or they will be delisted. Companies will have until Dec. 15 to comply. A representative of Deutsche Borse said that by mid-April, 53 companies had applied for the Entry Standard, of which 11 were admitted and 38 delisted, so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some industry participants, the closing of the First Quotation Board and the higher requirements for the Entry Standard have raised concerns about financing options. They worry that young companies won't have many alternatives, especially at a time when private equity and bank financing can be hard to find in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many players welcome the stricter oversight as a means of weeding out dubious companies and improving the reputation of the Frankfurt exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will make the market more respected,'' said Marvin Rowe, the managing director of Go Public Pros in Berlin, a company that advises companies that want to go public. ''It's good for everyone in the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a swipe at President Obama's signature health care legislation, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey vetoed on Thursday an online marketplace that the Legislature created to help residents and small businesses buy health insurance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Affordable Care Act, the federal law passed in 2010, requires most Americans to have health insurance and mandates states to have health care benefits exchanges to help them buy it. With the Supreme Court debating whether the health care law is constitutional, Mr. Christie said in his veto message that the exchange, approved in March, was ''premature'' and could impose ''unnecessary obligations upon the state's citizens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Indeed, the very constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act is cloaked in uncertainty, as both the individual mandate to procure health insurance as well as the jurisdictional mandate to establish an exchange may not survive scrutiny by the Supreme Court,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because it is not known whether the Affordable Care Act will remain, in whole or in part, it would be imprudent for New Jersey now to create an exchange before these critical threshold issues are decided with finality by the court,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Christie was the second governor to veto such a law, following Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, who is also a Republican. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, took the opposite tack last month: after the Legislature declined to create an exchange, he established one by executive order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Christie's veto is largely symbolic. The federal law requires states to offer health care exchanges by January 2014, but provides that Washington will step in to administer them in states that fail to make progress by January 2013. In either case, the state pays to set up the health care exchange, but states that fail to create the exchanges lose the ability to oversee them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democratic lawmakers accused the governor of playing politics with the needs of the most vulnerable residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clear from his actions that he is more focused on winning praise from national Republican pundits than protecting New Jersey families' access to health care,'' said Assemblyman Louis Greenwald of Camden, the leader of the Democratic majority in the State Assembly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democrats warned that the governor's veto would leave the state scrambling to comply with the federal law and could jeopardize future grant money. New Jersey had already received two federal grants, totaling $8.7 million, to prepare the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblyman Herb Conaway of Burlington, a doctor who was the lead sponsor of the legislation in the chamber, said the governor was sending a message that ''he doesn't care'' about the 1.3 million state residents without health insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By vetoing this bill, Governor Christie has failed New Jersey's uninsured residents, hurt New Jersey's chances of fully benefiting from federal health care reform and ignored the need to provide relief to hospitals for uncompensated care,'' Dr. Conaway, a Democrat, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats in the Legislature had billed the exchange as one-stop shopping for people or businesses seeking health insurance, allowing consumers to compare the benefits and the costs of participating plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site it proposed would have also allowed people to apply for tax credits or other subsidies toward the cost of insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his veto message, the governor said he was concerned about the potential costs of the exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill passed by the Legislature would have established a Medicaid-like plan for people with incomes between 133 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Mr. Christie argued that it was unclear whether there would be federal financing to support such a plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he argued that the mechanism the bill set up to approve plans would limit the number of companies that could participate, which he said would both reduce options and increase costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In all, with basic issues regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act unresolved, it is impossible to know whether this legislation best suits the interests and needs of all New Jerseyans who will be required to finance these policy choices,'' the governor wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Christie said that if the federal law was upheld, he would oversee the state's compliance ''in a responsible and cost-effective manner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the governor cited the cost of putting the exchange into effect, Democrats in Washington and Trenton argued that the bigger cost was allowing so many residents to remain uninsured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New Jersey taxpayers are on the hook every time someone without coverage shows up in an emergency room, whether it's for life-threatening treatment or routine medical care,'' United States Senator Robert Menendez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 14, 2012, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a veto by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey of an online health-insurance marketplace misstated, in some copies, the title of a lawmaker who criticized the governor's action. The lawmaker, Louis Greenwald of Camden, is an assemblyman, not a senator. (As the article correctly noted, Mr. Greenwald is the leader of the Democratic majority in the Assembly.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'VE spent the last week traveling to two of America's greatest innovation hubs -- Silicon Valley and Seattle -- and the trip left me feeling a combination of exhilaration and dread. The excitement comes from not only seeing the stunning amount of innovation emerging from the ground up, but from seeing the new tools coming on stream that are, as <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>'s founder, Jeff Bezos, put it to me, ''eliminating all the gatekeepers'' -- making it easier and cheaper than ever to publish your own book, start your own company and chase your own dream. Never have individuals been more empowered, and we're still just at the start of this trend.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere,'' said Bezos. Thanks to cloud computing for the masses, anyone anywhere can for a tiny hourly fee now rent the most powerful computing and storage facilities on Amazon's ''cloud'' to test any algorithm or start any company or publish any book. Start-ups can even send all their inventory to Amazon, and it will do all the fulfillment and delivery -- and even gift wrap your invention before shipping it to your customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is leading to an explosion of new firms and voices. ''Sixteen of the top 100 best sellers on Kindle today were self-published,'' said Bezos. That means no agent, no publisher, no paper -- just an author, who gets most of the royalties, and Amazon and the reader. It is why, Bezos adds, the job of the company leader now is changing fast: ''You have to think of yourself not as a designer but as a gardener'' -- seeding, nurturing, inspiring, cultivating the ideas coming from below, and then making sure people execute them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leading companies driving this trend -- Amazon, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Apple, LinkedIn, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> and Twitter -- are all headquartered and listed in America. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which didn't exist nine years ago, just went public at a valuation of nearly $105 billion -- two weeks after buying a company for $1 billion, Instagram, which didn't exist 18 months ago. So why any dread?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's because we're leaving an era of some 50 years' duration in which to be a president, a governor, a mayor or a college president was, on balance, to give things away to people; and we're entering an era -- no one knows for how long -- in which to be a president, a governor, a mayor or a college president will be, on balance, to take things away from people. And if we don't make this transition in a really smart way -- by saying, ''Here are the things that made us great, that spawned all these dynamic companies'' -- and make sure that we're preserving as much of that as we can, this trend will not spread as it should. Maybe we could grow as a country without a plan. But we dare not cut without a plan. We can really do damage. I can lose weight quickly if I cut off both arms, but it will surely reduce my job prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we must preserve is that magic combination of cutting-edge higher education, government-funded research and immigration of high-I.Q. risk-takers. They are, in combination, America's golden goose, laying all these eggs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. China has it easy right now. It just needs to do the jobs that we have already invented, just more cheaply. America has to invent the new jobs -- and that requires preserving the goose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> still does more than 80 percent of its research work in America. But that is becoming harder and harder to sustain when deadlock on Capitol Hill prevents it from acquiring sufficient visas for the knowledge workers it needs that America's universities are not producing enough of. The number of filled jobs at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> went up this year from 40,000 to 40,500 at its campus outside Seattle, yet its list of unfilled jobs went from 4,000 to almost 5,000. Eventually, it will have no choice but to shift more research to other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is terrifying to see how budget-cutting in California is slowly reducing what was once one of the crown jewels of American education -- the University of California system -- to a shadow of its old self. And I fear the cutting is just beginning. As one community leader in Seattle remarked to me, governments basically do three things: ''Medicate, educate and incarcerate.'' And various federal and state mandates outlaw cuts in medicating and incarcerating, so much of the money is coming out of educating. Unfortunately, even to self-publish, you still need to know how to write. The same is happening to research. A new report just found that federal investment in biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health has decreased almost every year since 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we shrink investments in higher education and research, ''we shoot ourselves in both feet,'' remarked K.R. Sridhar, founder of <span class="companylink">Bloom Energy</span>, the Silicon Valley fuel-cell company. ''Our people become less skilled, so you are shooting yourself in one foot. And the smartest people from around the world have less reason to come here for the quality education, so you are shooting yourself in the other foot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported two weeks ago that even with our high national unemployment rate, employers advertised 3.74 million job openings in March. That is, in part, about a skills mismatch. In an effort to overcome that, and help fill in the financing gap for higher education in Washington State, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> recently supported a plan whereby the state, which was cutting funding to state universities but also not letting them raise tuition, would allow the colleges to gradually raise rates and the two big companies would each kick in $25 million for scholarships for students wanting to study science and technology or health care to ensure that they have the workers they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a call to ignore the hard budget choices we have to make. It's a call to make sure that we give education, immigration and research their proper place in the discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Empowering the individual and underinvesting in the collective is our great macro danger as a society,'' said the pollster Craig Charney. Indeed, it is. Investment in our collective institutions and opportunities is the only way to mitigate the staggering income inequalities that can arise from a world where <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees can become billionaires overnight, while the universities that produce them are asked to slash billions overnight. As I've said, nations that don't invest in the future tend not to do well there.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- President Obama signed a bill on Wednesday that extends the life of the Export-Import Bank through 2014, ending an unexpectedly fierce political fight over an institution dedicated to financing American exports abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at the signing ceremony to an audience filled with owners of small businesses, Mr. Obama said the reauthorization of the bank was critical to leveling the playing field with China and other countries, which provide similar credit to their export industries.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're helping thousands of businesses sell more of their products and services overseas,'' the president said, ''and in the process, we're helping them create jobs here at home. And we're doing it at no extra cost to the taxpayer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama paid tribute to Congressional leaders who brokered the deal to preserve the bank, which was in jeopardy after Tea Party-aligned conservatives in the House and Senate seized on the need for reauthorization as a chance to mothball an agency they say is a purveyor of welfare to big corporations like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Caterpillar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the bank facing the imminent closing of its doors, business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers mobilized a strong lobbying effort that pitted traditional Republican interests against the Tea Party insurgency. The White House threw its support behind efforts to find a compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the House, the Republican leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, reached a deal with the minority whip, Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, under which the bank's lending limit would be increased to $140 billion over three years, from the current $100 billion. In return, the bank will be subject to new auditing and reporting requirements, which critics said would help ensure that it did not waste taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoyer and other Democrats were present at the signing ceremony, though Mr. Cantor was not. Last month, he came to the Rose Garden to watch the president sign a bill easing restrictions for small companies to raise money from investors. This time, said his spokeswoman, Laena Fallon, ''we weren't able to make it work with his schedule.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the bank's chairman, Fred P. Hochberg, the reauthorization brought relief after a nerve-rattling few months. Until this year, the reauthorization of the bank, which dates to the 1930s, had been a routine exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By signing this bipartisan bill into law, President Obama has once again demonstrated his strong commitment to America's business owners, workers, and exporters,'' Mr. Hochberg said in a statement. ''The president has been a strong champion of Ex-Im Bank and, thanks to his leadership, more U.S. companies are exporting to more countries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama said the Export-Import Bank was critical to his goal of doubling American exports over five years -- along with trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama; and trade enforcement actions against China. He cited a recent sale of 200 airplanes by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> to a foreign airline as a deal that would not have been signed without the bank's help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as our global competitors are providing financing for their exports, we've got to do the same,'' Mr. Obama said. ''So I'm glad that Congress got this done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president then swiftly turned to other things that he said Congress needed to enact -- a familiar list that includes streamlining the refinancing of home mortgages and tax breaks for companies that hire new workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are steps we can take right now to speed up this recovery, to help create jobs, to restore some of the financial security that families have lost,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's within our control to do the right thing and do it now.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is my first post for You're the Boss. I hope to add my two cents by shining some light on the state of small-business lending in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might help if you understand what I do in my day job. I am a small-business owner myself. Two and a half years ago, like millions of Americans in the Great Recession, I lost my job - a cushy corporate job with a company where I had worked for a decade and from which I had expected to retire. The company, Advanta, went bankrupt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day after I was fired by the bankruptcy trustees, I started my own company, MultiFunding. The mission of MultiFunding is to help small-business owners and entrepreneurs through the challenges of getting the loans and working capital they need for their businesses. We serve as brokers, helping business owners find the right sources of capital for their companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past two and a half years I have worked with hundreds of small-business owners across the country in all types of industries and at all stages. We have seen some companies that are exploding with growth and others that are exploding with too much debt. We have seen some companies with too few sales and others with more sales than they can handle. We have seen small-business owners who almost seem to be printing money and have little trouble finding financing and others who can't find it anywhere. And of course, we have seen many companies that fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These experiences have convinced me that the small-business lending market is poorly understood - and with good reason. There are now loan products out there with annual percentage rates of 4 or 5 percent and others as high as 60 or even 80 percent. In part, this is the unintended consequence of the big banks' tightening up their lending; that tightening created a vacuum that has been filled by a whole new world of alternative lending companies that have opened to take advantage of the situation. Many of these alternative lenders are backed by hedge funds that demand high returns. Many small-business owners find dealing with these companies painful, but in many cases they feel they have no choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our efforts to match borrowers with lenders at MultiFunding, we never work for the lenders. We are always trying to help the borrowers get the best loans for their situations: the lowest possible price with the best possible terms. We never take upfront fees from our clients, and we work purely on a success fee. And we only take on clients we think we can help. In other words, we eat if we are able to get successful outcomes for our clients; if not, we're out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going through this process, over and over, we have learned a lot of valuable lessons that I hope to share with you on this blog. Here are three broad themes that I plan to cover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-Business Lending Is a Highly Inefficient Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few owners have the time to investigate the ins and outs of the credit markets. The processes are confusing and overwhelming. If you type ''small business loan'' into <span class="companylink">Google</span>, you will find a myriad of options but little help figuring out which ones make sense for your company's particular situation. If you stop in at a branch of a large bank, you most likely will meet employees who are not really empowered to help you and do not really have time to dig into the nuances of your business. I will try to bring some clarity to this situation, so that perhaps a few more owners will know what to expect and will make informed choices. And perhaps the market will become a little more efficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-Business Lending Is a Confusing Mess</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why has there been so much less lending the last few years? Have the banks simply stopped making the too-risky loans they were making before the economic crisis hit? Did they overreact and stop making even sound loans to sound companies? Or did lending drop because after the recession, businesses started to retrench and their demand for credit declined? Did all banks stop lending or was it just the big banks? It is very hard to get definitive answers to these kinds of questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is that we can't even agree on important definitions. The Small Business Administration reports on lending activity, but nobody knows what percentage of overall lending the S.B.A. accounts for. The big banks release their scorecards on small-business lending but they define small businesses as those with revenue of $20 million or less. For its reports, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> defines small businesses as having revenue of $50 million or less. For its reports, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> defines small-business loans as those with balances of $1 million or less. The merchant cash advance lenders and factors do not release reports at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Small Business Owners Are Still Reeling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have been reading reports that the recession is over and that the economy is on the mend. I can assure you that for most small-business owners that we talk to at MultiFunding, this is far from the case. Many are still reeling from the recession and struggling to catch up. Working capital is a fight. Banks are not easy to deal with, and fair loans are tough to come by. If you own a retail or service business, it is even harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I plan to dig deeper into these issues in coming posts.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - When Alex Ljung, a multilingual entrepreneur, co-founded the audio-sharing Web service SoundCloud in Stockholm in 2007, he knew the company needed an international expansion strategy right away. The company didn't have a big domestic market or access to a large pool of world-class developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months after the company was started, Mr. Ljung and his business partner, Eric Wahlforss, moved to Berlin to be closer to many of the region's largest markets and tap into the city's booming start-up community. Earlier this year, he started breaking into the American market, securing $50 million of financing from <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, the Silicon Valley venture capital giant, and other firms.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ljung, who was born in London and grew up in Sweden, now splits his time between Germany and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was obvious that our business had to be global from the start,'' he said. ''We're more like citizens of the Internet than citizens of a country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Europe's market spread across more than 50 countries and the Continent's economy struggling under the weight of its debt crisis, local start-ups are forced to become global from the outset. As international markets, particularly fast-growing emerging economies, become ever more important to start-ups' growth, European entrepreneurs are hoping their experience in foreign markets will help them compete with more-established and better-financed American rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''An international mind-set is baked into the DNA of Europeans,'' said Saul Klein, a partner of the Geneva-based venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Index Ventures</span>, which has backed some well-known European start-ups, including Skype and the Internet radio station Last.fm. ''Great entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. Even start-ups from small countries can compete on the global stage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Silicon Valley continues to dominate the venture capital industry, other cities like London, Paris and Berlin are attracting large numbers of investors and start-ups in the technology industry and other sectors like financial services and fashion. The east end of London, which has become home to the city's young entrepreneurs, recorded a 40 percent rise in start-ups last year, according to British government statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young companies in big European capitals are able to draw upon a global, multilingual work force accustomed to moving between different languages and cultures. Well-educated graduates are also more willing to work for fledging businesses, since large companies aren't aggressively hiring in the current economic malaise. Since 2008, Criteo, a French company that helps businesses market to consumers online, has grown from 20 employees to a 500-person staff comprising more than 15 nationalities in its 15 offices around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've become a global company,'' said Jean-Baptiste Rudelle, a co-founder of Criteo, who has moved to the West Coast to run the company's operations in the United States. ''We are still a European company, but with an international footprint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new generation of European start-ups still faces a tough slog in the region's current economic environment. The volatile capital markets make it hard for new companies to go public, and many large businesses are reluctant to spend their large cash reserves to acquire start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists also have reduced their investments. Start-ups based in Europe raised a combined 762 million euros, or $958 million, through fund-raising in the first quarter of the year, a 41 percent drop from the same period last year, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource, which tracks the venture capital industry. Fund-raising for start-ups in the United States fell 18 percent over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the economic weakness, Kristjan Hiiemaa, the founder of the e-commerce software company Erply, continues to push ahead. Started in Talinn, Estonia, in 2009, the company now has offices in London and New York, and expects to more than double its client base to 100,000 customers by the end of the year. Erply counts a number of Fortune 500 companies, including <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, as clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In New York or Chicago, no one cares that we're from Estonia,'' said Mr. Hiiemaa, who takes chocolates from his home country to help break the ice. ''We have an international team and our clients are all around the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability to win new business in far-flung places is likely to become more important as start-ups focus on growth in emerging markets. Western countries still attract the majority of entrepreneurs' attention. But analysts say the rise of a free-spending middle class in countries like China and Brazil is forcing companies to develop strategies before local competitors, which often mimic the Western start-ups' business ideas, beat them to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compete in these developing economies, start-ups must be willing to quickly alter their businesses in line with the local cultures and languages. After successfully expanding into new markets and navigating the complexities of winning over foreign customers, European start-ups like SoundCloud and Erply think they're well placed to take advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The appeal of products has become international from the get-go,'' said Danny Rimer, a Silicon Valley-based partner at <span class="companylink">Index Ventures</span>, which has invested in both the companies. ''Europe's advantage is that companies already know how to adapt to new countries.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY large financial institutions are facing backlogs of mortgage applications as more homeowners take advantage of low interest rates and the government-sponsored Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers looking to accelerate the process are finding some relief from brokerages and community banks that are not servicing HARP loans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've heard stories about 60-day to 90-day loan waiting periods in some cases,'' said Michael Fratantoni, the vice president for research and economics of the Mortgage Bankers Association, adding that larger banks are ''running at full capacity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Mortgage Bankers Association weekly survey released Wednesday, nearly 80 percent of the mortgage applications were for refinancing; previous weeks' surveys showed roughly a quarter of the transactions were HARP-related. HARP was created by the federal government to simplify the refinances of homeowners with mortgages owned or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, who seek less onerous loan terms. The program was expanded last fall as HARP 2.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HARP borrowers typically refinance with the banks that originally serviced their loans, because those banks already have their information, Mr. Fratantoni said, and ''there's potential for it to be a less painful process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, tighter lending standards precipitated by the mortgage crisis have made for an arduous application process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Latos, a real estate lawyer in Astoria, Queens, who has represented clients in transactions with big banks and who worked with a broker to service his own home loan, says he charges more for closings these days, because ''a two-hour closing can quickly become a five- or six-hour closing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage brokers, for their part, are reporting an increase in business from those looking to streamline the entire process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have direct contact with the banks, so we always know what's going on with your file,'' said Vanessa Thatcher, a senior loan officer with Atlantic Home Capital in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., explaining that a broker can keep track of the application as it ''goes through so many hands'' at a large financial institution. Ms. Thatcher charges a fee of 1 to 2 percent of the total loan amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers can also act as financial consultants. ''A good percentage of the people who call me to refinance, I tell them not to,'' said Mark Yecies, the president of SunQuest Funding in Cranford, N.J. He recalled a borrower who recently came to see him after being told he was a prime candidate for a refinance. Mr. Yecies ran the numbers and found that a refinance didn't make sense, because the majority of the borrower's payment was principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers might also want to consider refinancing with a community bank. <span class="companylink">New York Community Bank</span>, for example, does not service HARP-eligible borrowers and is able to respond faster to non-HARP refinance requests, said Stephen Trayte, a senior vice president and director of residential credit for the NYCB Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">New York Community Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even his bank has been experiencing delays because of higher volume. He recommended that borrowers lock in a rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Normally, we do the whole transaction in less than 30 days,'' said Mr. Trayte, estimating that the average time has reached 45 days. ''There is about a 50 percent delay just because of the volume of activity, and that's without having HARP transactions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To handle increased demand, big banks like <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> have been adding staff members and underwriting centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> recorded a 31 percent jump in HARP volume after implementing HARP 2.0, said Vickee J. Adams, a spokeswoman. She estimates that it takes 90 days to complete a refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers will have a better chance of moving through the process in less time, she said, if they ''follow the necessary steps to complete their applications and submit supporting documents in a timely fashion.''</p>

That is the common wisdom, anyway, which a new study from the Fiscal Policy Institute strikingly confirms. The study, based on census data, looks at owners of small businesses across the country and paints a broad and detailed picture of immigrant entrepreneurship.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study found that there were 900,000 immigrants among small-business owners in the United States, about 18 percent of the total. This percentage is higher than the immigrant share of the overall population, which is 13 percent, and the immigrant share of the labor force, at 16 percent. Small businesses in which half or more of the owners were immigrants employed 4.7 million people in 2007, the latest year for which data were available, generating $776 billion in receipts. They accounted for 30 percent of the growth in small businesses -- those with fewer than 100 employees -- between 1990 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrant entrepreneurs are concentrated in professional and business services, retail, construction, educational and social services, and leisure and hospitality. They own restaurants, doctor's offices, real-estate firms, groceries and truck-transportation services. More of them come from Mexico than any other country, followed by Indians, Koreans, Cubans, Chinese and Vietnamese. California has the highest percentage of immigrants among small-business owners at 33 percent, followed by New York (29 percent), New Jersey (28 percent), Florida (26 percent) and Hawaii (23 percent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study did not look at immigrants' legal status, but because it covered only incorporated firms, not off-the-books operations, it presumably included few, if any, business owners without papers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By rousingly affirming the centrality of immigration in the American economy, the study exposes a fault line running through the Republican Party, which mythologizes small-business owners while treating immigrants with hostility bordering on fury. There is no shortage of conservative business owners who celebrate the immigrant contribution to America -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch are two -- but Republican leaders, including the party standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, have allied themselves with extremist efforts to limit immigration and hound and harass millions of unauthorized immigrants out of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In G.O.P. strongholds like Arizona -- and Alabama, home to sleepy small towns where Latino-owned bodegas and laundries are among the only signs of economic life downtown -- anti-immigrant policies are threating to strangle economic growth. If Republicans started believing their own rhetoric about small-business owners, they would see immigration not as a sea of troubles but as a deep well of capitalist energy, waiting to be fully tapped.</p>

His first start-up, an online education venture, flopped. His second, a video-sharing app for the iPhone, has sold only 20 copies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Slipper is optimistic. He should be. He's just 18, a founding member of the Paly Entrepreneurs Club, an extracurricular group at the local high school that sprang into existence last September -- the brainchild of about a dozen students committed to inventing the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have met weekly during the school year to discuss their ventures and ideas, explore matters like money-raising strategies and new markets, and host guest speakers. Once, they held a Skype chat with a software engineer in Sweden who described the intricacies of running an online music business.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gurle, who will attend the University of California, Santa Cruz in the fall, started a business last year aimed at supplying students to companies as software testers. It sputtered when he could not find enough companies interested in buying the service. He counts the effort a success anyway, he told the club at a recent meeting, figuring that the people he met will remember him when he returns with his next idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he is learning how to program for <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s new mobile operating system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Club members have been working on projects like a social network to help teenagers quickly organize study groups and a trading network for Bitcoin, a virtual currency.

The demographic somewhat reflects Silicon Valley, too; there were no girls, though all the boys say they wish some would join their club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also were few laptops or even tablets in the room, befitting a post-PC world. All the boys had their work on paper or smartphones. They passed these around to show off their latest concepts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone can always copy your idea, but that will be half-baked,'' Mr. Slipper said confidently. ''It's not theirs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Maa, another club founder, was up next to discuss his project, the study group social network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not out in public yet,'' he said, apologetically. Mr. Maa, 18, plans to study computer science at the University of California, Berkeley in the fall. His social life, which included attending many events for start-ups, had gotten in the way of building the network, which he calls Bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone had a project to present, and that was acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The goal here is inspirational,'' said Mr. Bajor, who is headed to the University of Southern California to study entrepreneurship. ''A great idea can hit you any time. Even if you do not have a great idea yet, if you have capabilities and passion others will want you on their team.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every would-be tech titan at Paly belongs to the club. Some were distracted by college applications and plans for the prom. Or other things. ''There are probably a half-dozen other kids who should be in this club,'' Mr. Bajor said, but they just didn't have time. ''They are too busy starting their own companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-up fever for these students is something they breathe in the air, or learn at home, with parents who work in the tech industry. Fern Mandelbaum, a partner at the venture capital firm Monitor Ventures, and a parent at the school, attended a club meeting to explain how her business works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The students in the club were not the only beneficiaries of Ms. Mandelbaum's advice: Her daughter, Skylar Dorosin, started and for several years ran a summer camp. Ms. Dorosin, 17, is heading to Stanford in the fall, and has turned the camp over to her 11-year-old brother, Miles Dorosin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The kids here have such an unfair advantage,'' said Aaron Levie, 27, the chief executive of a data storage company, Box, referring to students throughout the Valley. He recently spoke during Science Week at another local high school, nearby Los Altos High. ''In Seattle we had lots of computers, but we never had venture capitalists drop by.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his talk in Los Altos, he had this advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told them to make friends and leverage their four years of freedom,'' he said. ''If you look at Apple, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, you see that lots of foundational things can happen among high school friends.'' Like those other companies, he said, Box, valued at about $350 million, was built by several high school friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Whitson, a Paly economics teacher who is the club's faculty adviser, said that in recent years she had noticed a shift in the kinds of projects that interest business-minded students. ''In the 'olden days' we'd have a few jewelry designers or dog walkers among the students,'' she said. ''The Internet started to change that. In the past five years, things have boomed because of the iPhone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Whitson worries that the club may not survive without its enthusiastic leaders. Mr. Bajor, however, said his brother, who just finished his sophomore year, is eager to pursue his own start-up dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sophomore, 15-year-old Max Bernstein, helped the club recruit some speakers this year, but had to drop out of meetings because of time conflicts with the robotics club. Next year, though, he said he would have more time for the Entrepreneurs Club. He won't have to take gym class.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Silicon Valley is finally getting the treatment once reserved for rowdy housewives and excitable chefs: its own Bravo reality series. But the tech world is not quite ready for its close-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When details about the show, tentatively titled ''Silicon Valley,'' first seeped out, many here were offended, saying it would trivialize the difficult and important work being done in the valley. ''Yuck, please stay in LA,'' Kevin Rose, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, messaged his million-plus Twitter followers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The valley may be even more upset when it sees how well the final product captures the raucous reality of the tech industry in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series, which is now being filmed and is scheduled to be broadcast this winter, shows hard-partying youngsters vying to start companies in a frenzy reminiscent of the dot-com peak of 2000. It is a world where everyone seems to think that a good idea can lead to instant success and untold riches, because, after all, it has so many times before. It is a place where you feel like a failure if only one investor offers to finance you, instead of many begging to get in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Silicon Valley'' the show was in part inspired by ''The Social Network,'' the 2010 film about the founding of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Silicon Valley the place did not like ''The Social Network'' because the film said Mark Zuckerberg started <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> as a way to impress girls instead of changing the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that Mr. Zuckerberg's sister Randi is an executive producer of the series has therefore rankled. Ms. Zuckerberg, an executive at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> until last summer, declined to be interviewed, but defended her show on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. ''Inspiring more people to pursue an entrepreneurial American dream can only be a good thing,'' she wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone agrees. One former <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> colleague of Ms. Zuckerberg's took to Twitter to say she was ''terrified'' that the series would turn Silicon Valley ''into a laughingstock of an industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Trust me, enough people in this industry make laughingstocks of themselves,'' Ms. Zuckerberg replied. ''We're just capturing reality!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the cameras rolled the other day, Ben and Hermione Way, a photogenic brother-and-sister team from England, discussed the $500,000 they got to develop a fitness app. ''Four noes and one yes,'' Ben said, sadly. ''Not exactly people throwing money at us.'' He added that he developed the idea for the business while drinking in a bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another scene, at a sleek office where budding entrepreneurs rent cubicles, Kim Taylor described her start-up as based on personalized content in the luxury market for women. It is a little undefined, even to Ms. Taylor, who came here two years ago from Chicago. But then, her start-up is only a few days old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is something I'm figuring out in real time,'' she told her mentor, explaining that she has no background in either coding or product development, traditional paths to success in the valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show first floated into consciousness last fall with a <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> posting by a casting director. ''As long as you're living life in the fast lane, we want to hear from you,'' it said. But it was a brief trailer, released by Bravo in April, that really set people off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One line, delivered by Ms. Taylor, seemed to provoke special ire: ''Silicon Valley is high school, but it's only the smart kids and everyone has a lot of money.'' (Later, she qualified her remarks on Twitter. ''Apologies that I said Silicon Valley was like high school. I meant middle school.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denunciation was swift -- on Twitter, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and blogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On behalf of all the entrepreneurs who've risked it all to build something, I am offended,'' wrote Francisco Dao, the founder of 50 Kings, a private community for technology and media innovators. One blog put it like this: ''The Horror of Reality Television Comes to Silicon Valley.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frances Berwick, Bravo's president, said that despite the provisional title, the series was not intended to capture the mood of the entire valley or depict the humdrum aspects of reality. ''In the editing process, we try to get rid of everything that is going to be a snooze,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The valley has generally been forbidding territory for Hollywood, at least until ''The Social Network.'' ''We're so bland,'' said Jamis MacNiven, whose restaurant Buck's is a popular valley gathering point. ''People spend their weekends taking out last year's incredibly energy-efficient bulb and screwing in this year's even more energy-efficient bulb. No one ever dresses up except at the Burning Man festival, where they take off their clothes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Ms. Taylor signed on to the show, she was working at a local media company that developed <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ads. The other cast members include the Ways; Dwight Crow, who started Carsabi, a Web site for selling used cars, in a Mountain View apartment that is messy enough to qualify as a toxic waste zone; and David Murray, who is developing a weight loss app (''In a really successful scenario I have a million active users by the end of the year'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The barriers to starting an Internet company have never been lower. Technology is cheap. All but the most important jobs can be outsourced, saving on costs ranging from salaries to office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the idea counts. When it goes viral, the company can quickly be worth hundreds of millions if not more. Yammer, a social network for companies, started in late 2008. Last month it was sold to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> for $1.2 billion last month, and no one batted an eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're a first-time entrepreneur, this is a phenomenal time,'' said Zaw Thet, a successful entrepreneur who is an adviser to Ms. Taylor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ways are skilled enough in media to have been contemplating their own reality show before Bravo came along. They know what it takes. Listen to Mr. Way working out with their trainer in front of the cameras, and you can hear the reality show buttons being pushed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing about Silicon Valley is it forgives failure -- but not as many times as we've failed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't believe how many entrepreneurs commit suicide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last night, there were like four of my ex-girlfriends in the house -- and I've only been here a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their house is a $17,000-a-month crash pad with an outdoor pool -- very unusual for chilly San Francisco -- and three levels of decks from which to admire the excellent view. If you divide by the five roommates, Mr. Way said, it is not so much money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To defray expenses, his sister sold $50 tickets to her birthday party. She also lined up sponsorships for the villa from a potato chip company and a coconut water supplier. The house has its own Twitter feed, which it uses to promote the chips. In Silicon Valley, the opportunities to be an entrepreneur never stop.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Bottom Market is a year-old restaurant and specialty food store in Guerneville, Calif., that also sells wine and locally made crafts. It is a moonlighting venture for its three owners, among them a San Francisco public relations executive, Michael Volpatt, who saw an opportunity to fill a local need after buying a weekend home in this Sonoma County town of 6,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CHALLENGE How to survive the lean months, October through April, when visitors to the Russian River getaway dwindle. After opening in July 2011, the market posted encouraging weekly sales of $20,000 to $24,000 in August -- that plummeted to as low as $4,000 by November, prompting staff layoffs and an emergency retreat to assess options.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE BACKGROUND Mr. Volpatt, who describes himself as a ''serious foodie and serious oenophile,'' had long dreamed of opening a specialty food and wine store. He decided to go ahead after settling deeper into the community of Guerneville, a once-booming logging town formerly known as Big Bottom for its location on the alluvial flats of the Russian River. Nowadays, the gay-friendly town is popular with weekenders and vacationers visiting nearby vineyards, kayaking on the river or hiking in nearby Armstrong Woods in what remains of the old-growth redwoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Volpatt, 40, would keep his lucrative day job: he owns half of a 10-year-old bicoastal public relations firm, <span class="companylink">Larkin/Volpatt Communications</span>, serving clients such as the digital divisions of <span class="companylink">Publishers Clearing House</span> and Hearst. Mr. Volpatt and his business partner, Kate Larkin, 45, who is based in New York, had already invested some of their earnings in real estate, including part ownership in an apartment building in St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both felt a market/breakfast and lunch spot was just what Guerneville needed. Chasing that opportunity was a leap into the unfamiliar world of retailing and restaurants but one they cushioned by entrusting the kitchen and market operations to a third founding partner with food and hospitality experience. Mr. Volpatt had become friends with Crista Luedtke, a San Francisco mortgage broker and hands-on owner of Boon Hotel and Spa and Boon Eat and Drink, two popular Guerneville businesses. With Ms. Luedtke overseeing day-to-day operations, Ms. Larkin acting as chief financial officer and Mr. Volpatt in charge of marketing, Big Bottom Market opened in a 1,500-square-foot Main Street storefront. The three partners provided $100,000 to transform the space, stock the shelves and supply operating capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new look was hip-casual. Hardwood floors, plenty of barn board, funky metal chairs at nine tables, stools at a counter and a communal table. The executive chef, Tricia Brown, off a stint at New York's Gramercy Tavern, created a menu featuring baguette sandwiches, soups and salads, and a signature-item-in-the-making: Big Bottom biscuits (regular, Cheddar and thyme, ham and cheese, even a ''sea biscuit'' with house-smoked salmon and capers and pickled red onions). The biscuit recipe belonged to Ms. Luedtke's mother, who, as one of 20 employees, helped with the baking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose like the biscuit dough in the peak summer weeks and then tapered off in September. Still, the business remained profitable, and with the biscuits getting good buzz, the fledgling owners pondered a spinoff venture, considering wholesaling batches of frozen biscuits beyond the ones they sold from their own freezer cases. Then, in October and November, the bottom fell out for Big Bottom. ''At the rate you guys are going,'' their accountant warned, ''You're going to have to close your doors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the owners had expected a downturn. ''We thought maybe we'd lose about 30 to 40 percent of our business,'' Mr. Volpatt said. But not 80 percent. ''This is my first time at the rodeo, and I'll tell you, we were freaking out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OPTIONS The owners immediately sought to stem the hemorrhaging expenses. They closed the market on Mondays and Tuesdays and trimmed staff. Then they gathered everyone for a crisis retreat and came up with the following ideas to save the faltering start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revamp the wine inventory. Start by marking down the highest-priced wines to move them and help cash flow. Then restock with wines in the $12 to $15 range. While fine for the vacation crowd, average prices of $30 to $40 per bottle shot well past the budgets of local residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market directly to Guerneville residents. Create a new sandwich each month for a prominent local resident and consider such promotions as a Thursday Community Day when everything in the store -- food, candles, crafts -- would be 15 percent off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Open for dinner. Put a toe in the water with a $20 three-course meal on Wednesday nights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add a catering component. Prepare party food for pickup and also for events held in the market for an added fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hit the road with a Big Bottom Market food truck. Increase sales and build the brand by turning the market's popular biscuits into a movable feast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tilt the business more toward biscuits. Market the proprietary recipe as ''the next cupcake'' and sell frozen, ready-to-bake biscuit dough wholesale into a leading gourmet market like San Francisco's Bi-Rite. Then expand from there, regionally or even nationally</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT OTHERS SAY Ari Weinzweig, founding partner of Zingerman's Community of Businesses in Ann Arbor, Mich.: ''Since no one knows exactly what will work, trying a lot of complementary things makes sense. We often look to specials -- high-demand items at a good price point that will help bring people in at off-hours. Additionally I would -- and they may well have already done this -- look at what else related to food and drink is not currently offered in town that could be added: product categories, services, etc. I'd also consider things that don't generate income directly but that bring people to their business and get them to think about the store. Often they're less than obvious: farm share pickup, classes on how to cater a party, hosting a food-writing group at an off-hour, local fund-raisers, classes for kids. Each small event or activity might only bring a few people but over time it adds up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Hirschkop, owner of Dave's Gourmet, a specialty food and hot sauce company in San Francisco: ''Big Bottom Market's situation is fairly typical for tourist-oriented areas. I would take a three-prong approach. Make sure that expenses are structured to match the seasonal income pattern -- talk to the landlord about a modified rent structure and make sure not to overstaff during the off-season. Really focus on the local population for the off-season and adjust your offerings, pricing and promotions to appeal to them. Look for additional revenue options for the off-season -- wholesaling food items, having cooking classes, selling specialty foods online.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Mogannam, owner of Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco, a community-oriented grocery store that stocks Big Bottom's frozen biscuits: ''Focus on delivering a product that the locals want and need, make sure it's priced right, and give it to them with the most genuine service you can. If the locals don't embrace and support it, the business will always struggle to survive. It will be difficult to maintain cash flow and to retain great staff so that the business can have the foundation and stamina it needs to thrive. The tourist months should be the gravy -- what make the business profitable and worth all the effort of being in the food business.''</p>

''There are 5.7 million firms with employees in this country, and about 5.7 million have fewer than 500 employees -- rounding slightly,'' said Robert McIntyre, the director of <span class="companylink">Citizens for Tax Justice</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's sort of metaphysical, when you get right down to it. I am you as you are me and we are one and we are all small businesses. Ich bin ein small business. No wonder politicians want to get on their good side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this takes us to President Obama's call for Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts for families with incomes below $250,000 a year. Most people, the president said, believe it is wrong to ''raise taxes on middle-class families.'' It was certainly a triumphant moment for the administration's economic policies. In 2008, who among us could have hoped that four years in the future, middle-class Americans would be making $250,000 a year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Romney called the idea ''a massive tax increase on job creators and on small business.'' He also denounced it as ''another kick in the gut to the middle class in America,'' thus signaling his determination to broaden the American middle even further, as well as to call everything the president does a ''kick in the gut'' for the rest of this campaign season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do we feel about this argument, people? We are not talking about business taxes, in the normal sense of the word. If we were, it would quickly become so incredibly confusing that you would be begging me to go back to the matter of the dog Romney once tied to the roof of his car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical American business owner does not pay corporate taxes. He or she subtracts expenses from revenues and declares the bottom line as income. There are many, many advantages to this approach. You can avoid corporate tax rates, and it's a lot easier to deduct things. If you're a baker of gourmet cupcakes, you can subtract the entire cost of your new $50,000 ovens from your income, right up front, as well as lunch with your best friend who is also an occasional cupcake purchaser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are rules, of course, but both the rules and the implementation of the rules are fuzzy,'' said William Gale, the co-director of the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And everybody can get into the game! Including partners in hedge funds and law firms and investment banks. ''Here's the beauty -- each of the hedge fund principals themselves is a small business,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council. Sperling is a small business himself because he gets occasional royalty payments for co-writing a few episodes of ''The West Wing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This flight to small is so popular that the Congressional Research Service concluded that if taxes on high incomes went up, it would actually create more small businesses because more rich people would want to ''seek self-employment because the opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance are greater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small business growth. It's what makes America great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Republicans claimed that capping the Bush tax cuts at $250,000 would hurt small businesses, the Obama administration quickly retorted that only about 3 percent of the small business owners have incomes above $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah, said the Republicans, but that little slice still represents more than 900,000 people, and half of all the nation's business income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah, said the Democrats, but that's because of the hedge fund managers and law partners and movie stars with rental property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yeah, said the Republicans, but the high-end sort-of-small businesses will still cut back on jobs or investment if their taxes go up. Taxes rise, bad things happen. It's an article of faith. The Hartford Financial Group said it did a survey that showed just that, although as Robb Mandelbaum pointed out in The Times, only 2 percent of the small businesses surveyed actually cited taxes as their prime concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do know these things: Republicans do not like income taxes, even for very wealthy people. Possibly particularly for very wealthy people. Barack Obama, who also has royalty income, is a small business. Possibly the only small business the Republicans do not love.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it only right that wealthy Americans chip in more to help the government meet its obligations? Or does raising taxes on the rich hobble the country's ''job creators''?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Obama proposed this week to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire for high earners, polar-opposite reactions from Republicans and Democrats were as swift as they were consistent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney repeated an argument he makes in almost every stump speech: that a tax increase on upper earners will slow hiring because most Americans work for small businesses, whose owners report earnings on their individual returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fifty-four percent of American workers work in businesses taxed as individuals,'' Mr. Romney said at a fund-raising event in Montana on Wednesday, repeating a figure he uses often. ''So when the president wants to raise taxes on individuals -- as he's proposed from 35 percent to 40 percent -- he kills jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama had anticipated this objection when he proposed on Monday to extend middle-class tax breaks beyond 2012, while urging -- once again -- that rates rise on earned incomes of more than $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, we can already anticipate -- we know what those who are opposed to letting the high-end tax cuts expire will say,'' Mr. Obama said at the White House. ''They'll say that we can't tax 'job creators.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most small-business owners would be exempt, he said, because ''97 percent of small businesses fall under the $250,000 threshold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans, by reframing the issue of taxes on the wealthy into a debate about job creation, have cannily evoked Americans' patriotic support of small businesses as an engine of economic growth. Democratic and Republican politicians are equally given to praising small businesses for creating a majority of jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the world of small businesses -- more specifically, of individuals who report business earnings on their tax returns -- is complex. Many enterprises do not fit the rosy image of a tech start-up in a garage or a mom-and-pop florist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama is correct that only a tiny sliver of business owners make enough to land in the top tax brackets. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan Congressional office, estimated last month that 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under the president's proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tax committee also supported Mr. Romney's assertion that this sliver represents a significant share of the economy: those top earners generate 53 percent of all small-business income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney's figure that a majority of Americans, 54 percent, are employed at companies whose owners file taxes as individuals is from a report by the accounting firm <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>, according to the Romney campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report examined all types of ''flow-through'' businesses, in which profits pass from the business to the individual owners for tax purposes, including partnerships, sole proprietorships and other entities not subject to corporate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number and share of the economy of flow-through businesses have steadily grown in recent decades, to the point that many would hardly be considered small businesses. Seventeen percent of workers in flow-through enterprises work at companies with more than 500 workers, according to <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flow-through businesses include large law partnerships and hedge funds. Before it went public in 1999, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> was a flow-through business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans often argue that the owners of flow-through businesses are sensitive to marginal tax rates in making hiring decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I used to run a small business; I used to have pass-through income,'' the House speaker, John A. Boehner, said on Tuesday, promising to kill the president's proposal in a vote later this month. ''I would have been affected by this tax increase that the president's calling for. This is not going to help our economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the question of whether small-business owners are encouraged or deterred by marginal tax rates is robustly debated by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I've got $100 after taxes and you raise my tax rate and it goes down to $80, I might be less likely to go out and hire an additional worker, because I don't have enough cash on hand,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Mr. Holtz-Eakin has done research linking an entrepreneur's lower individual tax rate with a decision to hire more workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another expert, William G. Gale, a director of the nonpartisan <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>, disputed the notion that raising marginal tax rates on small-business owners depressed hiring. These businesses can deduct wages from their revenues, he said, with the potential to lower their effective tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They can deduct everything in full,'' Mr. Gale said. ''It's a canonical result in economics that if you can immediately deduct the investment, then the effective tax rate should be zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, recent studies have challenged the notion that small businesses are a key engine of job creation. Older small businesses, it seems, cut more jobs than they create. Research by the economist John C. Haltiwanger and others showed that the only small businesses that create more jobs than they destroy are those less than five years old -- in other words, start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The small-business sector per se is not necessarily a dynamic part of the economy,'' Mr. Gale said. Reducing taxes on high individual incomes across the board is applying too broad a brush, he said, to stimulate the fraction of small businesses that are young and innovating and generating most new jobs.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal appeals court in Philadelphia has brought some welcome common sense to the thorny question of how to judge patent cases in which brand-name drug companies pay substantial sums to generic competitors who then delay bringing their drug to market. A three judge-panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled on Monday that, absent clear evidence to the contrary, such payments should be viewed as ''prima facie evidence of an unreasonable restraint of trade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the case ever reaches the Supreme Court and this verdict is upheld, it could go a long way toward ending a devious tactic used by drug companies to frustrate efforts to speed the advent of generic drugs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tactic is known as pay-for-delay and is used when a generic manufacturer tries to bring its drug to market before the patent on a brand-name drug has expired. The generic challenger typically argues that the patent is invalid or that its product does not infringe upon the patent. With billions of dollars at stake, a brand-name manufacturer might prefer to pay its generic competitor substantial money to drop its challenge and delay marketing its drug, and the generic maker might prefer to accept a big payoff rather than face the uncertainties of litigation and actually trying to sell its drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that case, the big losers are consumers and public and private insurers who are stuck with continuing to pay monopoly prices for brand-name drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span> had been campaigning to curb such tactics and succeeded in eliminating them for several years but was stymied when two appeals courts ruled in 2005 that such do-not-compete settlements are a legitimate way to settle patent disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current case is separate from these previous cases but arises from the same issues. It involves K-Dur 20, a potassium supplement made by <span class="companylink">Schering-Plough</span> that mitigates the side effects of drugs that treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. <span class="companylink">Schering-Plough</span> holds a patent for a coating that releases the active ingredient for a sustained effect. It paid one generic challenger $60 million, purportedly for licenses to other products made by the generic company, and another generic challenger $15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Third Circuit has now ruled that such payments must be presumed an unreasonable restraint of trade unless the drug makers can produce evidence that, for example, the payment really was for some purpose other than delayed entry. That makes sense as a judicial resolution, but the best solution would be for Congress to pass legislation making it harder for companies to engage in such underhanded tactics.</p>

Biden Jr. who is now a senior fellow at a Washington research group, argued that Americans are not as overtaxed as some may think. I decided to follow up with Mr. Bernstein to ask him about small businesses and taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I assured him that many small-business owners -- particularly those making more than $250,000 per year -- feel that increasing their taxes will take away cash that they could use to invest, hire people and grow their businesses. I asked him if he agreed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course it's often a burden on a business -- or a household, or a dog or a cat -- to increase their tax payments,'' he said. ''And smaller businesses have less insulation -- typically less cash reserves, less access to credit markets or export markets -- from such increases. But there are two key issues that are overlooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''First, remember, it's only the income above the $250,000 threshold that's facing a higher tax rate. If your business income -- and we're mostly talking pass-throughs here -- is $255,000, it's not that whole sum that faces the higher rate, it's the $5,000 above $250,000. So if the top rate goes from 35 percent to about 40 percent, which is what's on the table, that's $250 in new taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Second, as my blog post emphasized, in historical terms, households and businesses are paying less in taxes than they have in decades. I'm sure it doesn't feel that way -- this remains a tough economy. And I'm sure there are exceptions. But the data are very clear on this point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Finally, let's not forget that we're talking about less than 3 percent of small businesses here, so I'm not sure about your framing of the question: many small businesses.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At my loan brokerage firm outside Philadelphia, MultiFunding, we hear all kinds of stories from small-business owners. Typically, when businesses have trouble raising capital, it takes some work to figure out what the real issues are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's an example: A hairdresser recently called us to ask for help getting a loan. She was exhausted, at her wits' end and angry at the bank.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She explained that she owned the studio where she worked and that her mortgage loan was coming up for renewal. While she had a lot of equity in her property, she said, the lenders she had approached expressed concern because she had a one-woman shop -- and they said they considered this deal too risky for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging just from those facts, my initial reaction was that if there really was value in her property and if she was current on all of her payments, we would probably be able to help. I was confident that we could find a Small Business Administration lender that would be interested in giving her a loan. After all, if everything went bad, the lender would end up with a property that was worth about twice the value of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once we dug deeper, however, we learned some things about the borrower that created problems. First of all, she was on payment plans with three government entities. This immediately knocked her out of the running for an S.B.A. loan -- you have to be current on all of your taxes before you can benefit from an S.B.A. guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can sometimes solve this situation by paying off the back taxes with a six- or 12-month merchant cash advance loan before the borrower gets the S.B.A. loan. But in this case the back taxes were too large, more than she could borrow on this kind of loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hairdresser's second problem was that she had called her mortgage company a few months earlier and explained that she was having a tough time. She asked if she could make interest-only payments for a while. This was an honorable thing to do, but it is likely to give any potential new lender pause.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVERYONE, it seems, has an app or a genius idea for one. Credit the lackluster job market plus facile tools and technology -- no Ph.D. in programming required -- for the rise of campus hack cultures that reach far beyond engineering and computer science majors and Stanford and M.I.T. Big rewards like the $100 billion public offering for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which was conceived in a Harvard dorm, and its $1 billion splurge on Instagram only feed the fantasies of code-writing college students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, four Emory students -- Ian McCall, Nir Levy, Giovanni Hobbins and Pat Shea -- met in Mr. Shea's dorm room to upgrade the Web site of a student group but instead decided to build a portal to organize campus life. Thus was born Campus Bubble, a platform for university information and postings from campus groups, students and businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now headquartered in Mr. Shea's apartment (he graduated in May), the founders have four summer interns and are working madly to launch version 2.0 next month after a pilot run last year attracted 4,000 users. Mr. McCall, a senior, recalls early meetings as ''really exhilarating.'' He'll also tell you that the adrenaline rush of hatching a hot idea comes with a counter-rush: What now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instinct may suggest you head west. That's the play if you land a spot in Y Combinator (despite a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> plea, Campus Bubble did not). Admission to the three-month program is more competitive than Harvard or Yale, and comes with cachet. You give up a percentage of your start-up's equity. But those who get in, like Wesley Zhao and Ajay Mehta (Mr. Zhao is on leave from the University of Pennsylvania and Mr. Mehta from New York University), say the advice, speakers, community and high-power tech network is worth the price. ''They provide you with so much value from Day 1,'' says Mr. Zhao, who with Mr. Mehta developed FamilyLeaf, an online site for sharing family photos and news. The accelerator connected them with two additional founders, and $170,000 in initial financing. And their March ''Demonstration Day'' performance (sporting T-shirts hand-painted the night before with their company name) earned them several new investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inclusion in private incubators like Y Combinator and TechStars is coveted because of their strong track records with start-ups (<span class="companylink">Dropbox</span>, Bump, Loopt) and the Silicon Valley icons who serve as mentors. But young entrepreneurs can find good help without leaving campus. ''It's possible for a 20-year-old to create something that changes the world,'' says Bryce C. Pilz, a University of Michigan law professor who works with student start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's revolutionary thinking for a university culture that has long focused on the inventions of graduate students and faculty. But campuses are beginning to put their bets on undergraduates. Who better understands the social media mindset? And what campus wouldn't want an Instagram founder as an alum?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Campus incubators are growing. New data from the <span class="companylink">National Business Incubation Association</span> show that about one-third of the 1,250 business incubators in the United States are at universities, up from one-fifth in 2006. Even nontechie campuses like <span class="companylink">Northern Kentucky University</span>, Duke and Syracuse have jumped in the pool, recently adding or planning to add start-up incubators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On campus or off, incubators are not always useful. Some do little more than provide free or cheap space and a coffee machine. What entrepreneurs really need is guidance and like-minded peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span> decided to offer ''soup-to-nuts support'' for start-ups when it created the Office of Entrepreneurship two years ago, with workshops on crafting an elevator pitch and talks like ''Student Start-Ups: From Dorm Room to Board Room.'' Jim Chung, the program director, notes that today's start-ups are led not just by business and computer majors but by ''designers, musicians, anybody with good ideas,'' so universities need to connect these students to experts and to one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When students are doing crazy stuff, they need to be around other crazy people who think they're sane,'' says Moses Lee, assistant director of TechArb, a four-year-old university-sponsored student incubator (he prefers ''start-up hive'') in the basement of a parking garage at the University of Michigan. Getting into TechArb is competitive. Last fall, 65 teams applied for 20 spots. Its curriculum has students pitching to potential users or customers and leading a monthly board meeting to learn how to justify themselves to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee, who is starting up an online student portfolio for job hunting, says that talking about your vision and getting feedback are key early steps. Incubator offices are buzzing at 4 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although universities tend to view incubators aimed at undergraduates as the equivalent of a career office, they can also have claims on a student's I.P. (start-up parlance for intellectual property), says Todd Sherer, president of the Association of University Technology Managers, whose members turn campus inventions into commercial deals. Dr. Sherer, who is also director of Emory's technology transfer office, says undergraduates are typically considered sole owners of their inventions, but there are exceptions: if a student receives a university grant or is paid by the university for the work, if the idea is developed with faculty, or if a student uses significant campus resources to develop the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the University of Michigan, students had feared that bringing a project to class or sharing with a professor ''would trigger university ownership,'' Mr. Pilz says. The language in its policy -- that it could claim ownership if student inventors relied on ''direct or indirect support of funds administered by the university'' -- was having a chilling effect. In 2009, the university gavestudents sole ownership of their inventions, even if they work on the idea in a course or use university equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Entrepreneurship Clinic, in which law students provide free help to undergraduate start-ups, began in January and is now the most popular clinic at the law school; 97 students vied for 16 clinic spots for the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chung notes that universities would rather foster positive relations than collect shares in student businesses. ''Successful alumni breed successful schools,'' he says. <span class="companylink">Yahoo! </span>started on Stanford servers, but the university never sought ownership. Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders, endowed a $2 million chair in the School of Engineering and Mr. Yang and his wife have given $75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> is another story. Stanford owns patents on technology developed by two graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Federal filings for 2011 show the company paid Stanford $400,000 in royalties, and donated $3 million. Stanford's president, John L. Hennessy, is on the <span class="companylink">Google</span> board and some 1,300 Stanford graduates work at <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Campus Bubble founders initially ''worried about Emory taking some ownership,'' says Mr. McCall. But they needed the cooperation of the university -- it is The Emory Bubble they are attempting to introduce -- so they hired a lawyer and made a deal, giving Emory shares for use of the trademark. Charles Goetz, their teacher in an entrepreneurship class, became their adviser. He says the deal has opened doors, including landing the start-up's first investor. Mr. Shea agrees: ''The fact that we were working with the university gave us some legitimacy.'' The $25,000 infusion means the founders, who did Web development on the side to pay living expenses and a $2,000 legal bill, can now pay their interns and focus on their project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few student start-ups become <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Most don't even make a profit. Jeffrey Babin, business adviser for Wharton's Venture Initiation Program at the University of Pennsylvania, an incubator with 31 student start-ups, warns that ''ideas are a dime a dozen -- whoever gets it to market in the fastest and most effective manner wins.'' Success is elusive, Mr. Babin says, and young founders often decide that it makes more sense to work for someone else. But, he adds: ''The value of the venture may be zero. What you have learned? It's invaluable.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Parker, the 32-year-old billionaire and former president of Facebook -- played by Justin Timberlake in ''The Social Network'' -- was sitting on the top floor of his town house in the West Village of Manhattan last month, lamenting that too few entrepreneurs continue taking big risks after their first great success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every good entrepreneur I know ends up in the wasteland of being a venture capitalist. It's really frustrating,'' he said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker was sitting, or more accurately, slouching, on a couch next to his best friend and business partner, Shawn Fanning. Together, they founded Napster in 1999, the online music service that upended the entire industry before closing and filing for bankruptcy after losing a court case over piracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How can you as an entrepreneur that's had success, has a reputation, ever build the courage to go and do something again?'' he asked, almost rhetorically. ''Most entrepreneurs don't remain entrepreneurs. It's just too psychologically draining to have to constantly start over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a decade later, however, Sean and Shawn are at it again. The two recently started a video chat service called Airtime. (Think Skype, mixed with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and a twist of Chatroulette.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker and Mr. Fanning are the exceptions to the successful-entrepreneurs-still-working theory. Sure, there are a handful of serial entrepreneurs out there in Silicon Valley: Jack Dorsey started Twitter and Square, for example, and Elon Musk, who was behind <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, now runs <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Tesla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the career trajectory of many tremendously successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley often looks like a rocket ship that stops in midair. Less charitably, Mr. Parker suggests some could be called one-hit wonders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The list of people who have started from scratch over and over and succeeded systematically over a long period of time is incredibly short,'' he said. ''The only person I can think of off the cuff is Jobs who had Apple, Next, Pixar, continued doing Pixar and Next and then Apple again, which is really a different company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that the tendency of great entrepreneurs was either to become merely an operator of one company or, like Sumner Redstone, move into an investor-ownership role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Silicon Valley version becomes a venture capitalist. For example, Peter Thiel, who co-founded <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, has gone on to be a successful venture capitalist through his firm Founders Fund, investing in other companies' businesses, like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Spotify. But Mr. Thiel hasn't endeavored to start a new company himself. (He did start a hedge fund, but that's still investing.) He happens to be in business with Mr. Parker, who is a partner in the fund, which also invested in his Airtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Andreessen, a longtime star of Silicon Valley, co-founded Netscape in 1994. He started two companies after that: Loudcloud and Ning. Both had modest success, but neither was comparable to Netscape. Mr. Andreessen became one of those venture capitalists Mr. Parker dreads, but with an extremely successful track record of having invested in some of the most promising technology companies, including <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>, Twitter, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, Pinterest and Instagram (which was sold this year to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for $1 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Andreessen said of Mr. Parker's theory: ''I sort of agree with him.'' In an interview, he said many ''former entrepreneurs crossed over to be V.C.'s and it hasn't worked out well.'' He added, ''You don't want to be Michael Jordan playing baseball.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Andreessen said he differentiated his decision to pursue investing from that of other entrepreneurs-turned-investors, because he approached it as an entrepreneurial effort to ''rethink the model of venture capital.'' He has sought to reimagine the way a venture capital firm works from top to bottom, and so far, it appears to working quite spectacularly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, to Mr. Parker, most entrepreneurs who seek out investments do so as ''a total cop-out.'' He explained his thinking: ''You have a whole portfolio, you only focus on your successes, you ignore your failures and you get to continue looking like a player, but you're ultimately not in control of anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He continued: ''Everything is probabilistic, nothing is deterministic, so you never have that satisfaction of knowing that you're in control of an outcome. So you spend all of your time managing your reputation, managing your relationships and you spend almost no time thinking creatively or doing the things that an entrepreneur is good at doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it sounds as if Mr. Parker is talking only about others, he's not. He's also talking about himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After stepping down from <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> in 2005, he joined Mr. Thiel's Founders Fund and for several years worked on making investments, including in Spotify and Votizen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also worked on Causes, a site to raise money and awareness for issues and nonprofits. That venture only muddled along, and he said he did not commit to it wholeheartedly enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the biggest challenge for any new start-up by a previously successful entrepreneur was focusing too much ''on downside protection, which is just assuming failure from the outset.'' Being worried about failure and its effect on one's reputation, he said, is ''very dangerous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was reluctant to start a new company like Airtime until just recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The expectation thing definitely weighs on me. There's a sort of fear of launching something and failing,'' he said. ''I had to decide I am going to try to go the road less traveled and just be an entrepreneur that's willing to go back and start things from scratch.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, said on Wednesday that he planned to sue Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and several city commissioners to compel them to turn over data on the city's revenue from fines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit would follow several months in which Mr. de Blasio has criticized the administration for what he has called an overly aggressive approach to issuing fines, which he said hurts small businesses and is driven by the city's hunger for revenue.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue from fines collected by 20 agencies that regulate small businesses have grown by almost 70 percent in the decade since Mr. Bloomberg took office, to roughly $820 million in fiscal year 2011 from about $485 million in fiscal year 2002, according to an analysis by Mr. de Blasio's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early May, Mr. de Blasio sent letters to six agencies asking for the number, type and dollar amount of fines they had issued in every year since 2002. He also asked if the agencies placed quotas on the number of violations issued or the amount of revenue collected by each inspector. He asked for a response by June 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. de Blasio said that two agencies, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Department of Consumer Affairs, had told his office they were working on a response; the other four, the Transportation Department, the Sanitation Department, the Buildings Department and the Finance Department, did not respond at all, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio said the response was unacceptable, but typical; he said the administration had on other occasions declined to provide him with information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're just not going to stand for it anymore,'' he said. ''It is the administration ignoring the mandate of the city charter that they have to be transparent with an oversight entity like the public advocate's office. And we've decided there's no choice now but to turn to litigation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the mayor, Marc LaVorgna, said the city would have all the data Mr. de Blasio had requested compiled soon. He said that a majority of the increase in fines over the last decade came from tickets issued to drivers, including parking tickets and moving violations, the fines for which have gone up, and tickets for running red lights, the number of which has jumped since the city installed more red-light cameras. He said that the remaining increase in fines was from the city's efforts to make the city safer and cleaner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Restaurants are cleaner, construction sites are safer, fires have come down, and our streets are cleaner and safer than ever,'' Mr. LaVorgna said. ''That is a result of enforcing the regulations we have put in place and the laws the Council has passed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the first time Mr. de Blasio, who is expected to run for mayor next year, has taken legal action against the administration. In May, he filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a lawsuit brought by a taxi industry group against the administration's plan to create a new class of livery cabs. Mr. de Blasio said that the plan, passed by the State Legislature, was illegal because the City Council had not passed a home rule message giving the Legislature authority to approve it.</p>
