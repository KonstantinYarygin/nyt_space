<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One afternoon in early 2014, an employee of the Manhattan co-working space Coworkrs got behind the handlebars of a large tricycle and began pedaling it through the Flatiron district. The tricycle was outfitted with a small desk; the employee seemed to be sitting at her desk while cycling around the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A company called Peddler Pop-Ups had designed the display and rented out the tricycle for use as a rolling advertisement. (The tricycles can also be used as pop-up stores.) Peddler Pop-Ups is one of six companies founded and operated by a 27-year-old entrepreneur named Danielle Baskin. She does not have any employees, and until this month, Ms. Baskin's businesses had their headquarters in a 160-square-foot live-work space in the East Village.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She credits a variety of relatively new, inexpensive e-commerce platforms and services with enabling her to test new concepts and quickly start new businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baskin started her first venture, Inkwell Helmets, in her <span class="companylink">New York University</span> dorm room in 2008, when e-commerce was much more difficult, and expensive, to break into. As an art student interested in optical illusions, she hand-painted a scene of a blue sky and white clouds on her bike helmet and varnished it to a high gloss. When she wore the helmet on bike excursions around the city, people frequently stopped her to ask where she had gotten it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't intend to turn it into a company,'' she said. ''I just thought it was a cool object. But then, once I made a few designs, I thought, 'There are so many possibilities.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She began painting helmets with different images: a brain, an apple, a phrenology chart, a honeycomb. Initially, she tried to persuade boutiques and bike shops to carry her helmets. But although her products were unique, she struggled to break in to the bricks-and-mortar retail industry. So she decided to sell the helmets online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baskin couldn't afford to invest in a sophisticated website, so she built what she describes as a ''really scrappy-looking'' one. Customers could look at photographs of the helmets on the site but couldn't order or pay for them there. Instead, they ordered them via email and paid with <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After her graduation in 2010, she bounced between apartments and live-work spaces. At one point, her studio was a 20-square-foot area in a loft. Later, she rented a 42-square-foot room in a co-working space; she kept such late hours that she often slept there at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Baskin's helmet business began to flourish, she came up with ideas for more products and services. Most stemmed from efforts to solve problems she was facing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While looking for a way to display and sell her helmets at Citi Bike stations, she bought an old tricycle from a friend and turned it into a pop-up store. She realized she could rent out the tricycle when she wasn't using it, and Peddler Pop-Ups was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she wanted to safely search for locations of Citi Bike stations while riding a Citi Bike, she designed a smartphone case that attaches to the rectangular handlebars of the bike. Now she sells the cases, which can be used on other bikes, through Trillobox. She also runs a sign-making business called Signmaker.nyc that serves clients in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. And she sells her own artwork and other products through two other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Ms. Baskin was ready to test these other ideas to see if they had business potential, technology was available that allowed her to easily create professional-quality websites that accepted credit card payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, more tech firms are catering to small-business owners like Ms. Baskin. ''There are a lot of plug-and-play elements and services you can access to put it all together,'' says Leah Edwards, director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the <span class="companylink">Stanford Graduate School of Business</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now when Ms. Baskin comes up with a new product or business idea, she gauges whether there's a market for it by quickly setting up a website using the content-management system Squarespace, which links to a payment processor called Stripe. She then relies on digital analytics tools, including Google Analytics and Inspectlet, to see if an idea is catching on. If so, she begins selling the products right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She can also instantly see if a product is striking out. ''If no one is going to a certain site or if no one's responding to an email from a certain account,'' she said, ''maybe that thing isn't a good idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until a few months ago, Ms. Baskin handled her own shipping -- boxing her products and ferrying them by tricycle to the post office every few days. Now she saves time by mailing them via Shyp, an on-demand shipping service that sends a messenger to her studio to collect the items, wrap them and ship them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But building an e-commerce business isn't as simple as putting up a website. ''The problem is that having a little tiny site, say on <span class="companylink">Shopify</span>'' -- an e-commerce service -- ''doesn't get you anywhere unless you put in a lot of work to direct people to it,'' Ms. Edwards said. ''You have to actually use <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or do email campaigns with your friends and create awareness that it exists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, Ms. Baskin has <span class="companylink">Instagram</span>, <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> accounts for most of her companies. So far, she has not felt the need to abandon any of her businesses after the early testing period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inkwell Helmets is her most successful venture. This year, she said, she has sold 20 to 75 helmets a month, an increase of about 200 percent over 2014. The helmets cost $85 to $300 apiece, depending on their intricacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Baskin says, despite the help from technological innovations, her workload makes it difficult for her to expand her businesses. Several start-ups have tried to place 200-unit orders for bike helmets painted with their logos, for instance, but she doesn't have the capacity to fulfill the orders because she is solely responsible for product design, fabrication, fulfillment and customer service for all six companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To churn out products more quickly, she plans to automate aspects of her production processes. Doing that requires a larger studio space with better ventilation, which Ms. Baskin said would be easier to find in California. So this month, she relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where she plans to start a fabrication lab next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving forward, the items will ''be micro-mass-produced, but won't look like they came out of a factory,'' she said. ''I want the quality of a handmade aesthetic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Baskin says she plans to design even more products and start even more companies. She'll also finally staff up, not with just one or two employees, she says, but an entire ''small team.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite her move to car-centric California, Ms. Baskin doesn't intend to abandon the two- and three-wheeled modes of transportation that have stoked her entrepreneurial creativity so far. She's planning to buy a folding bike to bring on trains and buses -- fodder, perhaps, for her next big business idea.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countertop device for making chewable ice shards was one of the most heavily funded projects last year on <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span>, raising nearly $2.8 million from more than 6,000 contributors. Engineers from FirstBuild, the project's creator, posted videos of their design prototype, filmed inside a tool-strewn workshop, and talked openly about the remaining technical challenges before their machine would be ready for delivery in mid-2016.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It looked like a typical invention dreamed up by a scrappy team seeking cash for manufacturing -- except that FirstBuild is a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding, a trend popularized by artists and tinkerers, is now so hot that corporate giants are looking for a way in. G.E.'s approach is an unusually bold one, but a growing number of large companies are experimenting with programs intended to capture some of the creativity and passion that popular crowdfunded projects can inspire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span>, one of the largest fund-raising sites, on Wednesday announced ''enterprise crowdfunding,'' a new offering for big brands. For a consulting fee that typically runs to six figures, <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> will help companies figure out how to harness the crowd's power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The conversations are very similar to the ones companies were having 15 years ago about social media -- like, déjà vu,'' said Jerry Needel, <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span>'s head of revenue and corporate partnerships. ''It's not just, 'We want to run a campaign, give us some best practices and we'll go do the rest.' It's much more early stage. It's, 'What should we do? What can we do? Let's figure it out.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, major brands are investing their resources in the work of independent entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip Petracca and his business partners, a group of self-described ''beer geeks,'' raised $234,000 on <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> last year to create the Fizzics Beer System, a device that uses a sound-wave generator to give canned or bottled beer a foam like draft beer. As they prepared to ship the first batch, they went looking for a retailer to bring it to a mass audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A meeting with <span class="companylink">Brookstone</span> quickly led to a deal. The $170 Fizzics machine was one of the retailing chain's best-selling holiday items and helped pioneer a process that the company recently formalized with its Brookstone Launch development program for fledgling products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some participants, like Fizzics, simply want <span class="companylink">Brookstone</span> to sell their goods. Others are looking for a more extensive partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Wenqing Yan, a recent college graduate, sketched out her concept for cat-ear headphones with glowing lights, she had a hunch the idea would be popular. But when 20,000 backers pledged $3.4 million to the project, Ms. Yan and her business partner, Victoria Hu, found themselves facing a much greater manufacturing challenge than they had anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not an engineer, and neither is my co-founder,'' said Ms. Hu, who obtained a degree in political economy from the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>. ''We were searching pretty actively for more professional help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Brookstone</span> spotted the project and reached out. Ms. Hu initially ignored the message, but after a production deal in China fell apart, she agreed to talk. With her and Ms. Yan's blessing, the company took over nearly all aspects of the project, including the manufacturing, shipping and customer service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Brookstone</span>, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and restructured under new ownership, hopes the creations that emerge from Brookstone Launch will be a cornerstone of its product portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of our priorities is to expand our innovation pipeline,'' said Thomas M. Via, Brookstone's chief executive. ''Crowdfunding seemed to be a natural place for us to go. We're counting on these unique items to be a growing percentage of our overall revenue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crowdfunding ventures of big brands tend to fall into two distinct categories. A very few, like G.E., have sought money directly. The Kickstarter campaign of the ''Veronica Mars'' movie raised eyebrows when fans realized that their money would be going straight into the coffers of <span class="companylink">Warner Bros</span>. -- but they still contributed $5.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more popular option is to solicit ideas from the masses. The grocery retailer FreshDirect ran a contest on RocketHub for new food products, and <span class="companylink">Hasbro</span> used <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> to seek party game concepts. The Shock Top beer brand from <span class="companylink">Anheuser-Busch InBev</span> sponsored a campaign for new inventions to combat California's drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both approaches can be risky. Just as with social media, where brands routinely humiliate themselves, the potential for coming off as tone-deaf is high -- and backers may not be inclined to participate when they know that a project's creator has deep pockets. A Honda campaign on <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> to preserve drive-in movie theaters collected only around half of the $100,000 it sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter, the biggest project crowdfunding site, is ambivalent about the rise in corporate enthusiasm. While Kickstarter does not bar big brands from using its site, it has not made any effort to cater to them. The projects it has hosted for well-known creators tend to be public-minded, like the Smithsonian's effort to preserve Neil Armstrong's spacesuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Creators of all shapes and sizes are welcome on Kickstarter,'' said David Gallagher, a Kickstarter spokesman. ''Backers ultimately decide what does well on Kickstarter, and they typically look for creators who are trying something genuinely new and creative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethan Mollick, a crowdfunding researcher at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</span>, thinks that is a very tricky pitch for big brands to pull off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are not normal transactions,'' Mr. Mollick said. ''Everyone concentrates too much on 'funding' and not enough on 'crowd.' These are people investing in you because they want to believe in you, and to believe that you need their help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G.E. acknowledges a few misfires in its FirstBuild crowdfunding experiments -- but not the ones it anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which spends $5 billion a year on research and development, got very little negative reaction for shaking the donation jar on <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> to fund its product preorders, according to Natarajan Venkatakrishnan, FirstBuild's director. The Opal ice maker, FirstBuild's second crowdfunded product, significantly exceeded its $150,000 funding target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the backers did not just want a device to eventually arrive in their mailboxes. They wanted to feel involved in and informed about its development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They want a personal email in their inbox every couple of weeks,'' Mr. Venkatakrishnan said. ''That's something we're still trying to find a balance on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As brands pile in and attach themselves to crowdfunding successes, the original backers of successful projects sometimes feel squeezed out. It is like finding that your favorite indie band has gone corporate and booked a stadium tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look at what happened with Oculus Rift,'' Mr. Mollick said, referring to the virtual reality start-up that raised $2.4 million on Kickstarter, and was then acquired by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for $2 billion. ''There was a real sense of betrayal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some entrepreneurs, though, going mass-market is not a risk -- it is the entire goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fizzics, based in Newark, gave <span class="companylink">Brookstone</span> a few months of sales exclusivity in the United States, but in March, it plans to begin selling its machine through several more national retailers. The company also sees a commercial fit for its device at any place that serves beer, like breweries and sports bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a whole new category that we're building,'' Mr. Petracca said. ''We're working on products with lower price points, and we're working on a higher-end product that does some very unique things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He isn't worried about big brands overrunning the crowdfunding market. One day, he intends for his company to be one of them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And should he be allowed to sell such terrorism policies to other small business owners who operate in large cities, even though the insurance he created openly states that it will not cover claims in cities with more than 1.5 million people?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> said in a 422-page response, is no. The business owner's lawyers said it was perfectly legal. A judge is expected to rule in the case this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ruling may determine the future strategies of entrepreneurs and small-business owners who have set up their own insurance companies to cover all manner of risks, some against likely occurrences, others less so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Establishing these so-called captive insurance companies, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of private companies, is perfectly legal where there are legitimate insurance needs not covered by commercial insurance companies. Captives have become increasingly popular in the last decade because they greatly reduce affluent business owners' tax bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premiums paid to the captive are tax-deductible. (The tax code has allowed premiums of up to $1.2 million a year to be tax-free.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some small captives are coming under scrutiny when the insurable risks -- many for things unlikely to happen or already covered more economically by commercial insurance -- are being used as a way to sidestep taxes, since few, if any, claims are paid out. And the money paid into the captive can be transferred to heirs at greatly reduced tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. is using the captive set up by Benyamin and Orna Avrahami, the owners of the Arizona jewelry stores, to challenge the validity of some small captives. It is arguing in its brief filed in United States Tax Court that the couple should not be able to deduct the premiums paid to their captive insurer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many captives have exploited the tax rules is hard to know, because captives are regulated by individual states -- as is any insurance company -- and some, as in the Avrahami case, have incorporated themselves offshore, which gives them an added layer of secrecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captives face other challenges as well. Congress included language in its 2015 appropriations bill that tightens the rules that grant people large tax breaks on the premiums they pay into these insurance companies. The rules take effect next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you're going to see is a lot of people scrambling to understand what's happening,'' said David J. Slenn, a lawyer at <span class="companylink">Quarles &amp; Brady</span> in Naples, Fla., and the chairman of the American Bar Association's captive insurance committee. ''They're going to have to fix the structure so in 2017 they qualify to make the election'' to get a tax break on the premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern about small captive insurance companies has been percolating since they landed on the ''Dirty Dozen List of Tax Scams'' published by the I.R.S. last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the small captive doesn't pay out insurance claims, the money accumulates as it does in a commercial insurance company. The company could elect to pay dividends to the people who own the captive. In the abusive structures, lawyers and accountants say, the captives pay out little in claims and the people receiving dividends are the children or grandchildren of the people who set up the insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those dividends would be taxed, the rate would be far lower than the income tax rate that the business owner would have avoided in putting the premiums into the captive, and the money would go to the heirs without being subject to the much higher gift-tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the appropriations bill, Congress set out to make this more difficult. At first glance, the appropriations bill seemed to give small captives a lift by increasing the tax-deductible premium in 2017 to $2.2 million and indexing it to inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Congress then added new hurdles. To prove that they are entitled to a tax deduction of the premiums, small captives now must meet one of two requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One requires that a captive prove that no more than 20 percent of the premiums come from one policyholder. Jay D. Adkisson, former chairman of the A.B.A. captive insurance committee and a lawyer at Riser Adkisson, said captives owned by one person wouldn't be able to meet this standard. Policyholder is defined in such a way that all family members are treated as one policyholder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second requirement prohibits an insured company from being wholly owned by one person and the captive by his or her heirs. And it limits the difference in ownership to 2 percent, Mr. Adkisson said. If, for example, the insured company were owned 100 percent by the parents, their children could own only 2 percent of the captive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are scrambling to understand that ownership rule,'' Mr. Slenn said. ''It can be pretty dangerous, and not just to those who are trying to abuse the transfer tax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There could, for example, be business owners who have used captives to pay claims but at the same time, on the advice of their accountants and lawyers, have named their children as the owners of the captive as part of an estate planning strategy. Or, Mr. Slenn said, there could be trusts that own the small captives as well as other assets, but it is the business owner's children who are the ultimate beneficiaries. Still, in some situations, certain types of trusts may still work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also no allowance for an existing captive to be grandfathered in under the new guidelines. If people don't make changes this year, they could be subject to the taxes that a regular captive pays next year. A captive could also find itself responding to an I.R.S. investigation, litigation or penalties. Yet if the owners unwind the small captive, they could be hit with capital gains taxes on the premiums paid into the captive, Mr. Slenn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. has signaled in the Avrahami case that it may be stepping up its enforcement efforts. At the very least, the agency seems to be making an example of this couple, who took what the I.R.S. deemed aggressive steps in the construction of their small captive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple enlisted Celia R. Clark, one of the lawyers in this field who has written about the estate tax benefits of captives. With her assistance, the couple created a captive with restrictions on the amount, manner and reason it would pay out claims. (It paid out a claim only after the I.R.S. began investigating it.) It also, the I.R.S. says in its brief, seemed to base its annual premium on the size of the tax deduction the couple needed for a given year and not on the price of the risk it was insuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In one year, you have half the premium charged, when there hasn't been any change in the exposures presented by the risk,'' said Donald W. Bendure, a risk and insurance management consultant at Robert Hughes Associates. He recently criticized the Avrahamis' captive in a call for <span class="companylink">American Bar Association</span> members. ''It really does have to make sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adkisson, in the same call, was even harsher in his criticism: ''The formalities are followed, but they're undone by email. Celia Clark, the owner of the company, the tax attorney and the C.P.A. are talking about a lot of issues where they make it pretty clear that what they're trying to do is create Kabuki theater for the service so if the service takes a look, it looks like a real captive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Clark declined to comment. Tim A. Tarter, a tax lawyer in Phoenix who is the Avrahamis' defense lawyer, said, ''We believe the facts support a finding that this was set up the way it was intended -- to insure risks that are not available commercially or to provide gap-type coverage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While tax planners are often aggressive on behalf of their clients, there are many other owners of small captives who will need to rethink what they have done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is years of some bad practices finally coming to light,'' Mr. Slenn said. ''A lot of people are waiting to see what happens with Avrahami.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Personal Finance pages on Saturday about a crackdown on so-called captive insurance companies, which are established by businesses ostensibly to protect against risk but that often also greatly reduce their owners' tax bills, misstated the action such companies must now take to demonstrate they are entitled to a tax deduction of premiums. They must either prove that no more than 20 percent of the premiums come from one policyholder, or that an insured company is not wholly owned by one person and the captive by his or her heirs. They do not need to prove both of those things.</p>

He noted that creative industries are the fastest-growing force in the British economy, pumping almost 80 billion pounds, or about $113 billion, into the country's economy a year, accounting for 6 percent of British jobs and growing three times faster than any other sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaizey added that he ''hadn't thought twice'' about whether to host the event at the prime minister's office, a gesture that he said was ''a clear sign of our commitment to the movement, and the confident, empowered community it is trying to create for creatives across the U.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cameron, although otherwise occupied in Switzerland, had prepared a statement to show his support for the project, too: ''From Asia to America, they're dancing to our music, watching our films and wearing our designers' latest creations,'' the statement said. ''With all this talent, it's no wonder that our creative industries form the fastest-growing part of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want us to build on that,'' he continued. ''And that means backing the best entrepreneurship in the sector, providing a focal point for the start-up support and resources creative people need. Creative Entrepreneurs does just that -- and its website is the first of its kind. I hope this, alongside the other measures we are taking to boost businesses, will help make one of this country's great success stories go from strength to strength.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conservative government, while traditionally an advocate for small businesses, has come under fire in recent months for policies that could have a negative impact on creative sectors, in which starting salaries remain low. For example, beginning in April, workers from outside the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> who have lived in Britain for five years or more will have to prove annual earnings of at least £35,000 to stay in the country legally. And as a referendum looms on whether Britain should stay in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, creative leaders have been quick to emphasize the importance of funding from the bloc and of ease of mobility for young artists between countries all of which could be lost if voters were to choose to leave the union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative Entrepreneurs might not solve those concerns, but it provides people in creative ventures such as fashion, television, design and theater with resources on topics such as writing a business plan, fund-raising, mentoring, finding work space and international expansion. While it does not offer direct support or grants, its focus on providing access to networks that are already available is a strategy Ms. Hindmarch supports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was lucky to have advice from a family of entrepreneurs; this offers all that and more, so I am both happy and proud to be supporting it,'' she said, surrounded by other British fashion industry figures including the designer Alice Temperley and Caroline Issa, the editor of Tank magazine. Both wore gold bracelets with colored chains by the British jewelry designer Monica Vinader, which served as name badges for the evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''London is the creative capital of the world at the moment -- just look at all the fantastic talent at London Fashion Week, or the films up for awards in Hollywood,'' Ms. Hindmarch added. ''We can't do too much when it comes to helping the next generation succeed.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- President Obama will propose in his 2017 budget new rules that would make it easier for small businesses to join together to form 401(k) retirement plans for their workers, even if the businesses are in different industries, administration officials said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials said that the proposal, if accepted by the Republican-led Congress, could make retirement plans available to more people by reducing administrative costs and compliance issues, which are sometimes too great for a single small business to bear.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to find new ways to help working families build up a nest egg,'' said Jeffrey D. Zients, the director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council. He said that retirement plans were not currently available to more than half of all workers at businesses that employ fewer than 50 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zients said that retirement plans were ''an important component of attracting and retaining workers,'' and that he was optimistic that both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill would support the president's proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses can already band together to form a retirement plan, though officials said that current law discourages them from doing so if the businesses are not closely related. They noted that some independent auto dealerships have united to create retirement plans for their workers, allowing the businesses to share costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zients and Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said the president would propose specific legal changes to promote the broader use of the program, often called an open multiple employer plan. Officials said the changes would clarify ''decades of precedent, both case law and guidance,'' that currently stands in the way of such plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the 401(k) proposal, Mr. Obama's budget will include other modest retirement initiatives, including one that would require businesses with more than 10 employees to automatically enroll their workers in an individual retirement account, known as an I.R.A., if the businesses do not offer a separate retirement savings program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That proposal has been part of the president's budget in the past, but officials said they hoped Republicans would support it this time. The budget will also seek funding for pilot programs that would provide new ways for people who change jobs to shift their retirement savings into programs offered by their new employers.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The odds of businesses owned by women winning a federal contract are about 21 percent lower than for otherwise similar companies, and years of effort to increase those chances have barely made an impact, according to a new report from the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is being released as the federal government is beginning to change a <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> program that is five years old this week, yet has never met a goal of helping companies owned by women win at least 5 percent of federal contract dollars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes, which were required by a 2014 law that also mandated the report, now make such businesses eligible for no-bid contracts so they can gain the experience needed to win other, competitive projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of federal contract dollars going to companies owned by women rose to 4.7 percent in the 2014 fiscal year, the most recent year that the report examined, from 4 percent in 2011, when the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> program to help such companies began, according to the report. Businesses owned by women, which are defined as companies that are at least 51 percent owned by one woman or more, account for about 30 percent of American companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are sobering statistics that show a real, unfair disadvantage for women entrepreneurs,'' said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, who sponsored the 2014 law, with Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've made good progress with the recent expansion of the women-owned small business contracting program, but this data clearly shows that this program should be expanded to more industries,'' Mrs. Shaheen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at the Commerce Department examined recent years' data for 304 categories of industries and more than 600,000 companies, about 20 percent of which identified themselves as owned by women. Winners of federal contracts tended to be the older and larger companies, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses owned by women generally are ''smaller and younger than other businesses,'' the report said. Yet that accounts ''for only part of the disparity in the likelihood of winning contracts,'' it added. ''Even when controlling for firm characteristics, including firm size and age, women-owned businesses are less likely to win contracts than otherwise similar businesses not owned by women.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report did not suggest other explanations for the disparity or ways to alleviate it. The changes mandated in December 2014 are too recent to show in the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2014 law allowed companies owned by women to qualify for no-bid ''sole source'' contracts, like those long available to minority-owned businesses and to those companies designated as economically disadvantaged. Federal officials have discretion to award such contracts to a single qualified small business after negotiating terms, thus avoiding prolonged bidding with multiple companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In sponsoring the law, Mrs. Shaheen drew on the experience of women like Sue Sylvester, the majority owner of Absolute Resources Associates, an environmental service company in Portsmouth, N.H., who struggled to get government contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think what my experience shows is that if the sole-source option is available for women-owned firms, it's going to change the odds,'' Ms. Sylvester said. That option -- which she first qualified for as an economically disadvantaged business because of her company's small size -- ''allowed us to get our foot in the door and show what we can do compared to the big boys.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, her company won its first contract with the <span class="companylink">United States Military Academy at West Point</span> to provide air monitoring and protection against lead, asbestos and mold contamination as West Point renovates old buildings, she said. Since then it has received others for handling hazardous wastes, monitoring water quality and cleaning lead from a firing range at West Point, and for monitoring drinking water at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extending sole-source contracts to companies owned by women should give them ''an opportunity to get that experience and get ready to compete'' for the more numerous and larger contracts bid competitively, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just difficult to get your experience shown,'' she said. ''That's the hard part.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs of a robust jobs market, reported Tuesday by the Labor Department, could ease concerns about the health of the economy, which were raised by other reports on Tuesday showing a drop in small business confidence in January to a two-year low and further declines in wholesale inventories.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 261,000 to a seasonally adjusted 5.61 million in December, the Labor Department said in its monthly job openings and labor turnover survey. It was the second-highest reading since the series started in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called Jolts report is part of the data watched by <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> officials to get a pulse on both the labor market and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase lifted the jobs openings rate to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent in November. The hiring rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent, indicating that employers were having trouble finding qualified workers for vacant positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 3.1 million Americans quit their jobs in December, the highest number since December 2006. That pushed the quits rate, which the Fed looks at as a measure of confidence in the jobs market, to 2.1 percent -- the highest level since April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Skeptics may argue that these numbers are backward looking, and that spillovers from tighter financial conditions or the energy slump will curb labor market dynamics in the months to come,'' said Harm Bandholz, chief United States economist at UniCredit Research in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is certainly a risk and one important reason why the Fed is currently sitting back and waiting. But why should this happen now when it hasn't over the past several months? After all, oil prices started to fall in mid-2014, and most of the adjustment occurred in the first half of 2015,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of unemployed job seekers per open job, a measure of labor market slack, fell to 1.4 in December, the lowest level since March 2007 and down from 1.5 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a separate report from the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> showed that its small business optimism index fell 1.3 points to a two-year low of 93.9 in January, businesses continued to report tightening labor market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses reported a shortage of qualified workers to fill job openings, prompting some to start raising wages to attract and retain them. The share of small businesses raising compensation increased to its highest level since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The combination of more job openings and more people quitting could result in pay increases, and we have seen a few other signs that wages have increased as the labor market has tightened,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wage growth, which has been frustratingly slow, picked up significantly in January. Still, growth in average hourly earnings is yet to break above 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis. Economists say wages need to grow 3 percent to 3.5 percent to lift inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories dipped 0.1 percent in December after dropping 0.4 percent in November.</p>

But they have gotten something else: greater clarity about deductions and credits, which should help their planning for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Congress passed the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act, which enhanced and made permanent several tax provisions that Congress had been renewing haphazardly in previous years. Some of those provisions were extended retroactively late in the year, which made it difficult to make informed decisions about long-term purchases and investments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's ironic is that there's very little in the PATH Act that's new,'' said Paul Gevertzman, a tax partner at <span class="companylink">Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin L.L.P</span>. in New York. ''Yet it's fantastic for small-business owners because it does away with all the uncertainty they've been living with for the past few years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the research and development credit, which the PATH Act made permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it may sound as though this credit applies only to companies that are scientific in nature, ''that's actually not true,'' said Jonathan Medows, a certified public accountant in New York who works with small businesses and freelancers. ''It could be for companies developing new software, but it could also be for bakeries developing new recipes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such company is Doughnut Plant, a Lower East Side bakery with trademarked jelly-filled square doughnuts and a cult following.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner, Mark Isreal, and two assistants are constantly tinkering with new recipes or baking techniques, says Krsna C. Salazar, the company's chief operating officer. It can take years for that research to bring to market a new product -- like vegan marshmallows, which are for sale, and gluten-free doughnuts that don't require xanthan gum, which the company is working on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor and ingredient costs that go into developing such innovations -- or even new flavor combinations, like green shiso doughnuts -- qualify for the R.&amp;D. credit, said Ken Pischel, an accounting consultant for the firm, which employs about 120 full- and part-time workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More companies will be able to take advantage of the credit, which has been broadened in application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, for instance, start-ups with no profits to speak of -- and therefore no income tax liability -- couldn't take advantage of this credit. But starting in 2016, some start-ups that have less than $5 million in gross receipts can apply the credit to the Social Security portion of an employer's payroll taxes, up to $250,000, said Magda Szabo, a tax partner at <span class="companylink">Grassi &amp; Company</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another obscure-sounding provision may be even more useful: Section 179 write-offs were made permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this so important? Because those deductions are related to equipment, and the tax break can apply ''to pretty much anything you can touch,'' said Barbara Weltman, author of ''J.K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2016: Your Complete Guide to a Better Bottom Line.'' That is, with the exception of most real property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction companies, for example, can't use this provision to write off a building. But the purchase of a cement mixer may count, Ms. Weltman said. And ''if you own a small motel, all the new ironing boards you buy for each room qualify, too,'' she added. So do basic computers and software. ''Even new desk lamps qualify.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, small-business owners could use the Section 179 provision to write off up to $500,000 toward the purchase of new or used equipment as well as off-the-shelf software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the beginning of last year, that limit was set to fall to just $25,000. That is, until the PATH Act made the provision permanent and reset the limit at $500,000 for the 2015 tax year. That amount will also be adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before small-business owners take this deduction, though, they need to be aware of another option: In November, the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> issued new guidance on the ability of small businesses to simply expense tangible property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses have long had the ability to immediately write off smaller equipment purchases of up to $500 instead of taking depreciation deductions and carrying those assets on their balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in the 2016 tax year, the agency will raise the amount small businesses can immediately deduct to $2,500 -- provided those purchases can be substantiated by an invoice. This has the effect of sweeping in larger purchases, including office equipment and computer equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This just simplifies a lot of lives,'' Ms. Weltman said. ''There are a lot of small businesses that don't care about their balance sheets. They're not likely to be applying for a commercial loan where someone looks at their balance sheet. They're more concerned about keeping things simple.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crystal Stranger, a tax expert in Hawaii who works with many small businesses, cautioned that entrepreneurs should base their expensing decisions not just on the nature of the equipment in question, but ''on the business and what is needed at that time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted, for example, that a start-up company with little current income might not need to deduct purchases immediately for upfront tax relief. Instead, it might choose to stretch out depreciation, as the I.R.S. allows. ''When income does eventually come in, you will be able to reduce your tax exposure at that time,'' Ms. Stranger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also cautioned entrepreneurs to be careful when deducting expenses like the cost of a car. ''The majority of entrepreneurs don't have a vehicle that's used entirely for business purposes,'' Ms. Stranger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Section 179 does allow small-business owners to write off purchases of vehicles that are used more than 50 percent for business purposes. But for most passenger cars, the first-year deduction limit is $3,160. It is $3,460 for many lightweight sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. That's not counting an additional $8,000 in potential bonus depreciation if the vehicle qualifies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many business-use vehicles weighing from 6,000 to 14,000 pounds -- which tend to be S.U.V.s, vans and trucks -- small-business owners can deduct up to $25,000 under Section 179 rules, plus 50 percent in bonus depreciation for new vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they go this route, though, small-business owners must maintain records and receipts of a wide range of expenses including repairs, tires, parking fees, registration fees, insurance, tolls, gas and oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other option is for small-business owners to use the standard mileage deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the price of gasoline falling, though, for the 2016 tax year, the I.R.S. reduced that deduction slightly to 54 cents per mile for business use, down 3.5 cents a mile from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another tax rule category, the absence of inflation is why contribution limits to most retirement savings plans geared to small-business owners and the self-employed will be the same this year as in 2015. With Simple I.R.A.s, employees of small businesses can contribute up to $12,500 in 2016 ($15,500 for workers 50 or older) while employers can generally match up to 3 percent of participant compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-employed or freelancers may choose to go with an individual 401(k) retirement plan. Like an employer-sponsored 401(k), these plans let a worker stash as much as $18,000 a year in 2016, while workers 50 or older can save an additional $6,000. Regardless of which plan a person chooses, it's particularly important for the self-employed and entrepreneurs to take advantage of tax breaks to save. With highly variable income and no large employer to prompt them to save, ''the self-employed need to make their own retirement planning a priority as early as possible,'' said Maria Bruno, a senior investment analyst at the Vanguard Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another change that's noteworthy for the 2016 tax year: rising penalties under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-employed people or entrepreneurs who do not have coverage for ''essential health benefits'' for three consecutive months or longer this year -- and who don't qualify for an exemption -- will be subject to a stiff fine. In 2016, the penalty rises to 2.5 percent of annual household income (up from 2 percent in 2015), or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family -- up substantially from $975 for a family in the 2015 tax year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stranger warned, ''This is now a big risk for entrepreneurs who don't carry health insurance.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Technology stocks are gyrating. Valuations for once-vaunted private companies have been slashed and some start-ups have shut down. Even Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, recently said he was ''seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we have ever experienced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Silicon Valley, ask any start-up entrepreneur about the shifting economic environment and the answer often goes like this:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I haven't changed anything since this all started,'' said Manav Mital, the chief executive of Instart Logic, which speeds the delivery of computing services to customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pullback hasn't affected our hiring plans at all,'' said David Vivero, the chief executive of Amino, a free service that matches patients with doctors for appointments. He added that he was looking to increase his work force by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor has the downturn changed life at Gusto, a payroll management start-up. ''I'm excited about the shift,'' said Joshua Reeves, a founder of the company. ''Even in downturns, some businesses succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In technology, there is reality, and then there is start-up reality. Even as the tech industry is undergoing a reset in expectations driven by global economic concerns, many start-up executives say their companies are doing just fine. Those layoffs that are starting at small private tech companies? That decline in start-up funding? Maybe some start-ups are feeling it, but not their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's always the other guy who will suffer,'' said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at the venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Menlo Ventures</span>, which has invested in the ride-hailing company Uber and the food-delivery start-up Munchery. ''I'm no psychologist, but all the people we've backed have never been average. They never think the things that happen to average people will happen to them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs' confidence levels remain buoyant even though investors are telling them that the change from go-go-go times to merely go-go will have consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message from Rory O'Driscoll, a partner at <span class="companylink">Scale Venture Partners</span>, that entrepreneurs should be more careful is often ignored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There hasn't been a company where the pullback in funding hasn't been discussed,'' he said. ''But if a person has had a conversation about this 10 times and it hasn't sunk in yet... ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Driscoll's voice trailed off. ''I'm tired and grumpy because I've had three of these conversations today and in every one you have the same discussion,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At start-ups small and large, ''there's still not enough caution,'' said Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist at Breyer Capital, who was one of the earliest investors in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Mr. Breyer predicts that over the next two years, 90 percent of the privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion will see their valuations fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, start-up entrepreneurs are operating much as they did during the recent boom times. Data from <span class="companylink">Jobvite</span>, a recruiting service used by start-ups, show no drop in hiring activity or salaries in the San Francisco Bay Area. Well-appointed offices that look like photo shoots for <span class="companylink">Design Within Reach</span> and perks like free Uber rides and in-house meals remain common at the companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The narrative of start-up comeuppance is in the air, but we haven't seen a statistically significant change in food budgets,'' said Arram Sabeti, the chief executive of ZeroCater, which serves meals to tech companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the food from tech companies that goes uneaten is piling up. ''Two years ago, we picked up 15 tons of food a week and now we're picking up 17 tons a week,'' said Mary Risley, whose group <span class="companylink">Food Runners</span> in San Francisco distributes leftover office food to the city's homeless residents. She attributes the increase largely to start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Instart Logic</span> in Palo Alto, Calif., the company recently hired a sales executive to help drive an expansion, using money from a $45 million funding round last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been reading a lot about a slowdown and asking myself about what it means, but we just closed a substantial round of funding,'' said Mr. Mital, characterizing his recent financing as ''one of the easiest fund-raisings we've had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many entrepreneurs seem to maintain a blithe disregard even though the deflating private market is a constant topic of conversation at tech conferences, private dinners and fetes held at the Battery, a San Francisco private club known for its tech-heavy membership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The air of detachment pervades the talk. Shan Sinha, the chief executive of the video conferencing start-up Highfive, said his customers were discussing ways to save money over the coming months. But he said he and his founder friends wonder ''whether what's happening in the world will have an effect on us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other entrepreneurs emphasize that any downturn will be good for them. Less venture capital money should lead to fewer competitors; a less crowded market may also make it easier to recruit talented people. Mr. Reeves, of Gusto, said that if his customers found themselves in financial straits, that would create another great selling point for his company, which can help businesses save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's awesome to see this conversation come up,'' Mr. Reeves said. ''Most have only known the froth of the cycle. Now it's time to create companies to solve real problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-up employees, on the other hand, seem more circumspect than their bosses. Last year, many saw the value of employee-issued shares at formerly highflying businesses drop, creating more interest in the nuances of their compensation packages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I bring up issues that could impact the value of their stock, employees want to talk about them,'' said Mary Russell, a lawyer based in Palo Alto who counsels individuals about their equity compensation. ''Last year there was less concern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message of more caution is not lost on all start-ups. Some are cutting back on expenses, albeit just a little. Jeff Selzer, the manager of Palo Alto Bicycles, a specialty bike store, said he was seeing fewer start-ups build custom $10,000 bicycles as signing bonuses for new managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are going further. Origami Logic, a marketing analytics start-up, held its annual off-site meeting for salespeople last month at a rustic coastal lodge near Santa Cruz, Calif. The company said that other start-ups typically hold such events at luxury hotels in San Francisco or Las Vegas, which can cost twice as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Ben Katz, the founder of the mobile banking app Card.com, said he had found ways to save more than 30 percent a month on his company's computing services bills by using less server space. He is looking to sublet a 100-square-foot space in his office to save $12,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, we wouldn't have justified taking the time to do little things like that, but now we take time to find ways to grow sustainably,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, confidence reigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can make a compelling case that our software will help save money during a downturn,'' said Greg Waldorf, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Invoice2go</span>, a start-up based in Silicon Valley and Australia that makes an invoicing app. Another plus, he said, was that his own company did not burn through cash at a fast rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For us, it's business as usual thanks to how I've been leading the company,'' Mr. Waldorf said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRICKHOWELL, Wales -- Fifty small businesses line the cobbled streets of Crickhowell. There is a bookstore and a bakery, a salmon smokery and a pub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is Steven Lewis's coffee shop, Number 18 Cafe &amp; Brasserie, which, like a lot of the other mom-and-pop operations in Crickhowell, houses a grievance that resonates far beyond the town's borders.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewis, 63, a broad-chested former military man, has helped turn Crickhowell into ground zero for a revolt by small-business owners in Britain against a tax system they see as rigged against them in favor of multinational corporations like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>. The town, population 2,063, has become famous for being one of Britain's last holdouts against the encroachment of big retail chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewis said he paid the 21 percent corporate tax rate on his profits last year, equivalent to 31,000 pounds, or $45,200. By contrast, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> -- which is based in the United States but does business in Britain and is therefore subject to British taxes -- paid just £4,327, or $6,274, in corporate tax in 2014, or about one-seventh of what Mr. Lewis paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s bill was also less than the average personal income tax payment and the national insurance contributions that individual British employees pay, which amount to about $7,800 a year for someone making the median income of $40,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is just one glaring example, Mr. Lewis and his fellow shopkeepers in Crickhowell said, of what amounts to multinational tax dodging on a gargantuan scale, leaving the little guy to pick up the tab. And their protest is one small case study of how economic populism is playing out around the world, rallying grass-roots support to challenge governments and corporate interests alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lewis, who retired from the army as a major and fought in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, is working with his regiment of shopkeepers to stoke public indignation across Britain so that consumers, and ultimately shareholders, will pressure company executives to change the way they do business. He plans to use social media and doorstep protests to ''name and shame'' corporate chiefs and those who support them, right down to their tax accountants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Always fight on the ground of your own choosing, never on the enemy's ground,'' he said, reaching for a military metaphor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His most recent effort at consciousness-raising came late last year, when he tried to replicate a favored financial tactic of multinationals and have Crickhowell and its businesses incorporate in tax havens. No dice, said the British tax authorities: Towns, unlike companies, are not allowed to register offshore, and Crickhowell's small businesses did not meet the legal definitions necessary to qualify for such a move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lewis has pledged to fight on, drawing on what he said were the approaches he learned combating terrorists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to be pretty brutal,'' he said recently. ''We will go for the throat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain's tax authority, <span class="companylink">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs</span>, said in a recent report that the amount of tax lost to Britain because of avoidance schemes was an estimated $4.3 billion in 2014, though it has fallen sharply over recent years as the government closes loopholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the authorities routinely come under fire for not doing enough. In the latest example, a $288 million settlement in back taxes with <span class="companylink">Google</span> was heavily criticized because the company's sales and profits ran into the billions. Many American companies that do business in Britain benefit from corporate taxes that are much lower than in the United States, where the combined federal and state statutory corporation tax is 39.1 percent. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has said that it is ''compliant with U.K. tax law'' and has emphasized that employees residing in Britain pay income tax on their earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just wrong,'' said Steven Askew, a baker in Crickhowell, as he took a break from work, his arms covered in flour. He and his wife each work 80 hours a week, he said, and paid more income tax than <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. ''Someone's got to stand up and say enough is enough. Enough with the injustice,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose Tabb, who works in a chocolate shop in Crickhowell close to the ruins of a 13th-century castle, was adamant. ''Either we all pay, or we don't,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jo Carthew owns the Black Mountains Smokery on the outskirts of town. Multinational companies are able to reinvest what they do not pay in taxes, she said, allowing them to grow ever bigger and stronger. She has not been able to afford expanding her staff since the company started more than 10 years ago, she said. ''The more I've learned about how widespread these offshore strategies are used, the more indignant I've become.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the tax offenders are not just American. There is <span class="companylink">Caffè Nero</span>, the London-based coffee chain that did not pay a penny of corporate tax in Britain for a decade. Cadbury, the British confectioner bought by Mondelez International of the United States in 2010, then named Kraft, has not paid taxes for the past five years, despite making about $144 million in profits each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large companies, especially those that operate around the world, typically employ complex, aggressive and sometimes creative financial techniques to hold taxes to a minimum, often by offloading some of the profits from higher-tax countries to lower-tax ones. Britain's tax authority defines the practice as ''operating within the letter -- but not the spirit -- of the law.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many shops in Crickhowell already have stickers pasted on their windows that declare themselves part of a ''Fair Tax Town,'' and 27 towns across Britain have signed up to that initiative, Mr. Lewis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another of his aims is to have the tax authorities enforce a five-star system that would rate which companies have paid the appropriate taxes and make the results public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The multinationals want to be in an incredible haze of technical complexity because they want to hide in it,'' he said. ''So what I want to do is get a big gust of wind that blows all that away.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Nathalie Miller decided to walk away from <span class="companylink">Instacart</span>, the grocery delivery start-up now worth more than $2 billion, she made a spreadsheet to analyze how much money she was leaving on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had been <span class="companylink">Instacart</span>'s 20th employee, managing operations during a period of extremely rapid growth, and the sum could have been huge. She quit anyway. Like many strivers in Silicon Valley, she had a bigger plan: to start her own company that could not only make millions, but also fulfill a mission she believed in.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her idea was to build a recruiting and hiring website that would make corporate America friendlier to women. She called the site Doxa and persuaded an engineer friend to start it with her. They strategized in borrowed office space and recruited people from other tech companies to work on the project at night, promising full-time salaries as soon as they raised venture capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, six months later, Ms. Miller discovered that she was pregnant with her first child. A baby wasn't something she and her husband, Isaak Le, had been planning quite yet, but they were excited. Still, a sliver of doubt began to undercut her confidence about starting her own company. ''How high can I stack the cards against myself -- a pregnant brown woman?'' said Ms. Miller, who is of Vietnamese and European descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley can seem like the land of overnight success. College dropouts show up and become billionaires a few years later. Mark Zuckerberg was a billionaire by the time he was 23, and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> paid $19 billion for WhatsApp when it was just five years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite their hold on the imagination, these examples aren't typical. Much more representative are the companies you never hear about because they never get off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital firms invest in 1 percent of the companies that pitch them. The overwhelming majority of entrepreneurs who are funded are white men. Just 1 percent are black, 8 percent are female and 12 percent are Asian, according to data from CB Insights, which tracks private companies and investors. Even for start-ups that raise money, the mortality rate is high, with most dying after an average of 20 months and $1.3 million in financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the fund-raising atmosphere has cooled as venture capitalists react to the poor stock market performance of some public tech companies and question whether the recent fast pace of investment is sustainable. Venture capitalists are making fewer investments at lower valuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is this delusion that it's easy to raise money in Silicon Valley,'' said Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, a mentorship and investment program for start-ups. ''Raising money is incredibly hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Silicon Valley keeps seducing people. For those who come, the risk is worth the potential reward -- not just riches, but also the more dreamy belief that tech entrepreneurialism is a force for good. Ms. Miller was not immune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want Doxa to exist in the world,'' she told me in July, ''because it will make the world a better place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A White Male Culture</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller, who turns 34 on Sunday, grew up in Berkeley, and after graduating from Harvard, moved to Vietnam. There, she started a microfinance nonprofit, expanding it to 92 employees. When she returned to the United States, she began a doctorate program in sociology at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, but was soon drawn into the tech industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She joined <span class="companylink">Instacart</span> in 2013, and saw some of tech's biggest challenges firsthand. In a year, the company grew to 120 employees from 20, and had 4,000 independent contractors. Hiring well at that kind of speed, she found, is hard to get right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller also experienced the challenges of being a woman in tech. One day, a new employee told her that he had ranked the hottest women at the company, and she was No. 1. She reported the comment to managers, and the employee was fired the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though she was satisfied with <span class="companylink">Instacart</span>'s response, she knew women in many industries faced much worse, and started ruminating about how she could change workplace culture more broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is when she came up with Doxa. The name comes from a Greek term that sociologists use to describe the things that people take for granted but that don't necessarily have to be that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea was for a site that would collect data about the sorts of things applicants really want to know but don't ask in job interviews: Do you feel as if co-workers value your opinions? Do people actually take their vacation days? How often do you work nights and weekends? It would offer online personality tests, then use psychometric data to match candidates with employers more effectively. It would make money from companies paying for information about candidates and to post job ads, as they do on <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span>. Sam Meder, who had run engineering at a start-up acquired by <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>, agreed to start it with her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller also saw Doxa as a way to address diversity issues. The statistics in technology are particularly bad. On average, 30 percent of employees at big tech companies including <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Apple are women, 5 percent are Latino and 4 percent are black. A diversity industry has sprung up to teach companies how to become more inclusive. Engineers attend training sessions on unconscious bias. Companies are hiring corporate diversity chiefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller thought Doxa could help by offering data that research shows is important to women -- the gender pay gap and the percentage of women on the executive team -- as well as factors like whether women felt they were given credit for their ideas. But first, she needed to raise money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists, who hold the keys to success in Silicon Valley by providing start-up money, are even more likely to be white and male than tech company employees are. Theirs is an insular business. Most investors accept pitches only from entrepreneurs who come through an introduction, and they tend to finance people who have succeeded before, or who remind them of those who did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a 2014 study published by the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span>, investors prefer pitches by men, particularly attractive men, to those by women, even when the content of the pitch is the same. In addition to studying the results of three entrepreneurial pitch competitions, the researchers conducted two experiments in which a representative sample of working adults heard identical pitches in male and female voices. Sixty-eight percent of people preferred to finance the company when it was pitched by a male voice, while 32 percent chose the female.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture firms with female partners are three times as likely to invest in a company with a female chief executive, according to the Diana Project at <span class="companylink">Babson College</span>. Yet just 6 percent of partners at venture capital firms are women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of investors' lack of diversity, they do not necessarily understand the value of companies that make products for customers who are not like them, said Tristan Walker, founder and chief executive of Walker &amp; Company, which makes health and beauty products for minorities, including the Bevel razor. On his first pitch, the investor told him she didn't think shaving irritation was a big enough societal issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All she had to do before she said that was get on the phone with 10 black men or women and eight or nine would have said, 'This is an issue I've had to deal with my entire life,''' Mr. Walker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are working to change this. Venture firms like Kapor Capital were formed specifically to finance start-ups with a diversity mission and to prioritize underrepresented founders. Others fill their partner ranks with people who are not white men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Deal flow comes in through people's network, and if you're a young woman or a person of color, a lot of times you just might not know who that senior person is at that top-tier firm,'' said Joanne Yuan, an associate partner at Cowboy Ventures, whose investment team of four has three women who are minorities. ''Our portfolio looks more diverse because we know a lot of people who aren't white males.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learning to Play the Game</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're live now, so it's a ticking time bomb,'' Penny Herscher, the executive chairwoman of FirstRain, a business software company, told Ms. Miller in July. ''Can you get enough momentum to get liftoff fast enough?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Herscher, who has two and a half decades of experience as a software executive, was introduced to Ms. Miller through a colleague and had agreed to become a kind of mentor. Ms. Miller had unveiled Doxa three weeks before. The site had 820 active users, and 300 companies on a waiting list to be included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it needed money. Ms. Miller had calculated that $2 million in venture capital would enable her to hire the people she needed and keep the company running for 18 months. But time was tight. She needed to start paying salaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had made her pitch to three small, mission-driven funds that wanted to invest in female and minority founders. Ms. Herscher said she should be aiming instead at well-known venture capital firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing is, no real investor is going to invest in you because of the mission,'' she said. ''They're going to invest in you if they think you'll make a lot of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The feedback we're getting from the big guns is we're too small now,'' Ms. Miller told her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They didn't wait for <span class="companylink">Google</span> to have a prototype before they invested,'' Ms. Herscher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time they met to discuss Doxa, Ms. Miller had worn jeans and a sleeveless shirt. The look was too unprofessional, Ms. Herscher told her. She should dress like Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer (whose uniform is crew neck, knee-length dresses with cardigans). Ms. Miller said that everyone she had worked with at tech companies wore jeans and T-shirts, and surely no venture capitalist cared if Mark Zuckerberg showed up in a hoodie. Ms. Herscher was uncompromising: Like it or not, the standard is different for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, Ms. Miller wore a dark cardigan over a dark blouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Herscher asked if she had been hit on yet by venture capitalists. She hadn't. Ms. Herscher told her own horror stories -- the investor who slipped his hand under her hair and massaged her neck, the one that rubbed her knee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller was more worried about the investors' reaction to her pregnancy. She broke the news to Ms. Herscher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After congratulations, they plotted strategy. Wait until the second meeting to mention it, Ms. Herscher said. ''Then say: 'I'm pregnant. And I'm so well organized that my baby's due on Christmas Day, which will be a slow time. I don't expect it will faze me at all. I'm married to a man who will be a primary caregiver, and this is no different from investing in a man whose wife is pregnant.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then her tone shifted. She wasn't talking about business anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having your first child is just physically hard, emotionally hard,'' said Ms. Herscher, who has two children. ''I would never discourage you or say you can't do it, because you absolutely can. Just be very clear why you're doing it and what price you're willing to pay, because the price is time with your baby.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the conversation, Ms. Miller talked with her husband, who works in advertising and was then a freelancer, about being the primary parent. He was on board. She figured she would take off a few weeks and get right back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gender issues and sexism that Ms. Miller's generation faces tend to be different from those of earlier generations. There is still blatant bad behavior, but official reports of sexual harassment have declined in recent years. More often, the challenges are subtler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the gender discrimination trial last year against <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, which the venture capital firm won, female employees said they were excluded from a ski trip, denied credit for deals they brought to the firm, and told they both didn't speak up enough and talked too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel like it's a lot more nuanced and sometimes it's subconscious,'' said Julia Hu, the founder and chief executive of Lark, which makes a health and weight-loss app. ''V.C.s are pattern matchers, and they're just used to seeing men like themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many women convey confidence and leadership in a different way than men do, she said. As an Asian woman, she said, she was raised to be humble and quiet and felt uncomfortable promoting her skills. ''To try to be who I thought they wanted me to be, which was another Mark Zuckerberg, was actually very difficult for me without feeling inauthentic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, she realized that describing business partnerships she had made, like one to preinstall Lark on new <span class="companylink">Samsung</span> phones, was a more effective way for her to demonstrate her leadership skills than boasting about herself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social science research supports Ms. Hu's experience. A series of experiments by Laurie A. Rudman, a psychology professor at Rutgers, found that women who spoke directly about their strengths and achievements were considered more capable, but also less hirable. Self-promotion by men made them more hirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parenthood, too, there is a double standard. Mothers are penalized in pay and promotions because employers assume they will be less committed to work, research shows, while fathers get raises because employers think they will be extra committed to breadwinning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People in Silicon Valley say new motherhood is particularly difficult, because competition moves at hyperspeed. Ms. Mayer, for example, felt the need to announce that she would be ''taking limited time away and working throughout'' her leave after giving birth to twins late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Speak in Bullet Points'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks later, Ms. Miller was back at Ms. Herscher's office, practicing her pitch while Ms. Herscher played the part of skeptical venture capitalist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller had been working 70 hours a week managing Doxa, recruiting companies, trying to raise money and working nights with the engineers who had day jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several firms, including 79 Studios, an investment fund focused on female entrepreneurs, had told her they would be interested in investing if another firm led the financing round. ''We're pretty positive on this from a mission point of view and even from a return on investment point of view,'' said Saujin Yi, chief executive of 79 Studios -- but the firm typically invested only alongside a lead investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though her pregnancy had been relatively easy -- at one point she vomited on the sidewalk after meeting an investor, and she was down to a single professional-looking dress that was loose enough to hide her growing belly -- she had not told any investors that she was pregnant, though two had obliquely asked if she was planning to have children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller began her practice pitch to Ms. Herscher: ''Doxa is a platform to match qualified people to the right companies. Once this platform exists, we're going to wonder how we ever found jobs before.'' She talked about the team and showed a diagram of how the service worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point I have no idea if this is important,'' Ms. Herscher said. ''You've told me there's a problem but not if it could make money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They ran through some more slides, including her go-to-market strategy -- aiming at women in tech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm immediately turned off and lost, because what you're telling us is you have this fantastic technology and star team, and you're going to go after this itty-bitty market and a bleeding heart cause,'' Ms. Herscher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller finished her pitch. It needed to be crisper and more confident, Ms. Herscher said: ''It's an art to speak in bullet points. It takes practice. Sit in the car and say it over and over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''O.K., wear cardigans, speak in bullet points,'' Ms. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week later, she met with Ms. Yuan at Cowboy Ventures. Her tone was more confident and her pitch faster, and she had broadened it beyond women in tech. ''The tools can be used by anyone -- the recruiting market is gigantic,'' she said. ''What people want is not gender-specific, it's very millennial-specific.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yuan pushed back. ''There's this inherent tension in the way we monetize,'' she said. Doxa was asking companies to pay to use the service for recruiting while at the same time the site would publish potentially negative employee comments about the companies' culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It enables companies to be responsive: 'Let's get a maternity policy because we don't want to be up on your platform without that,''' Ms. Miller said. Smiling, she added, ''I love that you're saying 'we.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her next pitch was to <span class="companylink">NEA</span>, a global venture firm. She wore a gray, knee-length dress, cardigan and short heels. She thought the conversation flowed easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a few days later, both venture capitalists declined to invest. <span class="companylink">NEA</span> said Doxa didn't show enough traction with users yet. Cowboy said it wasn't clear that Doxa's technology was different enough from that of other hiring websites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really thought it was a good idea,'' Ms. Yuan said later. ''But there were really well funded start-ups in this space, and it was hard to tell because it was so early.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller told Mr. Meder that she was scaling back her ambitions from raising $2 million and hiring a full team to raising $500,000 for just the two of them. But things had changed for him. He had been given more responsibility at his day job, and it didn't feel fair to leave for Doxa, with its uncertain prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller canceled her coming pitches and told potential investors that Doxa was on pause. She had talked to more than 40 venture capitalists. But without her co-founder, who was building the technology while Ms. Miller built the business, venture capitalists were unlikely to provide financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flip side of overnight success in Silicon Valley is overnight failure. Start-ups can be so dependent on a single investor or partnership that a turn of events can change their fates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, Jason Shen helped found a start-up called Ridejoy, for connecting people who were driving long distances. For a time, it seemed as if it had the golden touch -- entry into Y Combinator, $1.3 million in venture capital and traffic pouring in from <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, where it posted its services. Vanity Fair did a photo shoot with the founders, and a writer profiled them for a book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> sent a cease-and-desist letter, forbidding Ridejoy to post on the site. By the time Vanity Fair came out, Ridejoy had laid off nearly all its employees and stopped working on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I see companies who raised $10 million, and I'm like, did we just not have guts? Did we just not follow through? Did we just not believe in our thing enough?'' said Mr. Shen, who now works at <span class="companylink">Etsy</span>. ''Funding is such a confidence game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is saving his money to try to play the game again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Perspective</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As her baby's Christmas due date neared and she approached a year of living off savings, Ms. Miller began to get an unfamiliar feeling: the desire for stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was searching for a new technical co-founder. A few of the investors and companies she had met during the fund-raising process had contacted her about working for them. She began consulting at Code 2040, a nonprofit that matches black and Latino software engineers with internships at tech companies, started by Mr. Walker and Laura Weidman Powers, whom Ms. Miller knew from college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of months later, Code 2040 offered Ms. Miller a full-time job, as the director of partner programs. She accepted. Building a new business focused on diversity fulfilled some of the hopes she'd had for Doxa. She imagined keeping Doxa alive as a side project, once she had more time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller's plan was to take a month off and get back to work. Then, right on time, on Christmas Day, she gave birth to a girl, Zadie Mai, and changed her mind. The baby took over her thoughts. ''I feel a mixture of intense love and protectiveness,'' she said. ''I want to hang out with the baby forever. There are my real physical needs and the physical dependence of the baby, all this stuff I didn't expect to be so consuming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she had an entirely new perspective on how undervalued caregivers are, and how people judge women for taking time off work for their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She decided to take at least six months off, doing some work from home after three or four months, and Code 2040 agreed. Her husband, meanwhile, had found a full-time job in advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller said the transition from start-up founder to employee and mother had given her a new perspective on success in Silicon Valley and, more broadly, on what her generation wanted from work, something she wanted to address in her new job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wasn't naïve,'' Ms. Miller said. ''I knew when I quit <span class="companylink">Instacart</span> that going on this entrepreneurial journey wouldn't be like 'The Social Network.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But for me, this was a lesson that it's not always a straight shot from idea to financing to taking over Silicon Valley and taking over the world,'' she said. ''Maybe this was just a lesson that being entrepreneurial and taking risks and jumping into new things you're excited about sometimes is not linear at all.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After more than 20 years of effort, the federal government has, for the first time, met its goal of awarding 5 percent of the money it spent on contractors to businesses owned by women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small companies captured 25.8 percent of the government's contracting dollars last year, representing $90.7 billion, the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> plans to announce on Wednesday. About $17.8 billion of that total went to businesses owned by women during the fiscal year, which ended in September.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news comes on the heels of a Commerce Department analysis showing that businesses owned by women are 21 percent less likely to win government contracts than otherwise similar companies. Companies owned by women tend to be younger and smaller than other businesses, but even accounting for those differences, the disparity remains, the agency found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government set its 5 percent target in 1994 for spending on women-owned businesses, which are defined as those that are at least 51 percent controlled by women. It repeatedly fell short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, the government adopted new rules allowing agencies to set aside specific contracts for bidding only by companies owned by women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we can attribute the government meeting its goal directly to that being put in place,'' said Ann Sullivan, the head of government relations for Women Impacting Public Policy, a group that lobbied for the change. ''They weren't going to meet it simply by wishing and hoping; there needed to be a program specifically designating some contracts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent change, made late last year, allows procurement officers to go a step further on some small contracts and award them directly to qualified companies, without competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebecca Boenigk, the chief executive and a co-founder of Neutral Posture, a furniture manufacturer, said her federal sales increased immediately after the change. She brought in $7 million last year from government contracts and expected that number to double or triple this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the sudden, we're getting calls and interest from all over the place,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her company, in Bryan, Tex., employs about 100 people. It has been a government contractor for more than 20 years, but set-asides for businesses owned by women have been of little use to Ms. Boenigk because there are so few others in her industry for her to compete against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are only three qualifying women-owned furniture manufacturers in the United States, and you have to have at least two for a bid,'' she said. ''Now a contracting officer can just write a purchase order to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 36 percent of the businesses in America are owned by women, according to census data. Most have no employees other than the owner, but those with employees have a collective work force of 8.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with industry groups, the S.B.A. increased its outreach efforts in recent years to teach women who are entrepreneurs about federal procurement opportunities and help guide them through the often complex process of preparing bids. Maria Contreras-Sweet, who became the agency's head two years ago, made meeting the federal contracting goal a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women in Congress have also pressed for progress in recent years, introducing and passing several pieces of legislation intended to make contracts more obtainable for women who own businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, the ranking Democrat on the <span class="companylink">House Small Business Committee</span>, called the achievement of the government's procurement goal a long-overdue milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For too long, the federal marketplace operated as an old boys' club where contracts were steered to large companies, denying women entrepreneurs opportunities to grow their businesses,'' she said. ''This most recent announcement certainly exhibits progress, but we still have a way to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sullivan said she, too, hoped the momentum would continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Five percent is not a big goal, and it seemed like it took forever to meet it,'' she said. ''I'm hoping that agencies now won't sit back and go, 'The women are taken care of, we don't have to worry about it anymore.' I hope this will instead show that if the government is determined, they can make it happen.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was just six months ago that three venture capitalists, Trish, James and Palmer Higgins, took the biggest leap of their relatively young lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year researching 1,000 businesses, holding 75 conference calls and visiting prospects coast to coast, they made a decision. They would put their money -- and their hearts -- not into some cool Silicon Valley tech upstart or e-commerce innovator but into a snow removal and landscaping operation in Portland, Me.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they said in an interview with The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> for an article about their plans that they would double down on the risk by moving to Maine from their home in Greenwich, Conn., even before the deal was done. They became co-owners of Seabreeze Property Services in September with the company's founders, John and Pete Kelly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, with a half-year and a comparatively mild winter behind them, how is it going? What might the difference be between expectations for a new business and the reality? The question is one new business owners face all the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's easy to put together a grand strategy,'' said Ms. Higgins, 30, who bought the business with her husband, James, 31, and his brother, Palmer, 28. ''The big challenge is executing the day-to-day operation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most people tend to think of start-ups as a way to be your own boss, an increasing number of people -- some fresh out of business school and others looking for a second career -- are buying small businesses, or buying into them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of such a business in 2015 was just under $200,000 according to BizBuySell.com, the largest small-business marketplace in North America, but 8 percent of its businesses sell for more than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such small business may not be as trendy as start-ups, but for many eager to be their own bosses, they can be more rewarding than working in the corporate world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they are less risky. According to the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>, about half of all new businesses fail within five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> has no specific numbers of success rates among buyers of operating small businesses. However, Natalia Olson-Urtecho, mid-Atlantic regional director of the agency, said they were probably much higher than among owners of start-ups, because most businesses will not find buyers if they are not viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you buy an existing successful business, it already has a client base,'' said Ed Pendarvis, founder of Sunbelt Business Brokers, a company that brokers deals between small-business buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, said Mr. Pendarvis, who founded Business Buyers University, a company that offers information on buying and owning a business, in a typical financing case, most sellers have a financial stake in the company they are selling for several years after the sale, so they have a vested interest in its continuing success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition, the class taught by Royce Yudkoff and Richard Ruback, professors at <span class="companylink">Harvard Business School</span>, is any evidence, interest in small-business acquisition is growing rapidly. Five years ago, when they first offered the class, only a handful of students were interested. Last year 270 students took the course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business loans grew to $8 billion last year from $6 billion in 2014, Ms. Olson-Urtecho said, and many of them went to people buying operating companies. And the sale of small businesses grew by 53 percent from 2012 to 2015, according to BizBuySell.com, which now has more than 47,000 active listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Higgins group invested between $5 million and $10 million in Seabreeze Property Services, but declined to disclose an exact price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kellys, who have owned the business for 20 years, run the day-to-day operation, while the Higginses are developing an overarching expansion strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kellys talked to dozens of people about a possible partnership over the years ''to get to the next level,'' Pete Kelly, 46, said. Then things clicked with the Higginses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was a marriage,'' John Kelly, 51, said. ''If it wasn't the right fit, we never would have partnered up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Higgins agreed. ''We couldn't do what they do, and they couldn't do what we do,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the Kellys and Higginses speak enthusiastically of the partnership, even honeymoons have problems. For one thing, Seabreeze had no comprehensive database for properties it services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may sound easy, but most of the work is in a very tight circle around Portland,'' James Higgins said. ''They kept track of properties via nicknames, and the senior people know what to do and have all the knowledge in their heads, so something as simple as an address isn't written down. We're plotting it out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmer Higgins said one of the first challenges was transferring a whiteboard system that specifies who is working on what property into a computerized system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew it would be a big project and, if done well, would be a huge boon, but it's not a simple thing,'' he said. ''If you change this, you have to change that and this and this. It's like pulling a string.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they have had to contain their eagerness to rush forward, and have postponed the new computer system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acquiring a business and keeping the original owners on as partners is less typical than taking over completely, and has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The positive is that you have someone deeply experienced in the business,'' Professor Yudkoff said. But owners have ''operated as entrepreneurs who are answerable to no one,'' he said. ''It can be hard to change that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Shayler, who bought a musical instrument rental company in Reading, Pa., took over the entire ownership of the 93-year-old business, Zeswitz Music, three years ago. He was a management consultant before attending <span class="companylink">Harvard Business School</span>, and thought he would probably run his own company later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not until he took Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition that he realized it could be the next step in his career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After looking at about 200 possibilities and seriously considering six, he settled on Zeswitz, which he bought for several million dollars, using a <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> loan and investments from the very people who inspired his decision, Professors Yudkoff and Ruback. They have invested in the businesses of eight former students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the owner no longer helps run the company, ''she is a great resource,'' Mr. Shayler, 31, said, as is the highly experienced work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His business has grown significantly, he said, and he attributes that to spending several days a week doing sales calls at schools, and improving the quality of the instruments, their repairs and tracking the numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know that 98 percent of repairs go back out in two weeks,'' Mr. Shayler said. ''I don't think that was tracked before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Devin Mackoff, 30, like the Higginses, was featured in The Times article six months ago, right after he bought a landscaping company, Landscape Cod, on Cape Cod. He put $150,000 down and guaranteed the sellers about 10 percent of the revenue over the next three years. After a hectic summer, the winter gave him much-needed time to regroup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He decided to shift his business more toward gardening and project work and away from landscape maintenance. After some employees left him in the lurch, he said he was seeking a better way to recruit and keep staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We grew the business 10 percent last year, which is good, but I really needed the break to step back and say, 'This is working and this isn't.' '' he said. ''I need to have more people on deck rather than scrambling for them if someone just quits by text. I want people who want to work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a small business, unlike creating a start-up, means inheriting someone else's procedures, decisions and vision. And it may take a while not only to create a new vision, but also to determine the best way to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We realize that even if we know where we want to go,'' Ms. Higgins said, ''we still have to figure out the right pace.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years of planning and design work, XTI Aircraft, a start-up in Englewood, Colo., developing an experimental jet, was poised to finally leave the runway. The company had lined up its executive team, received its first patent and begun a crowdfunding campaign for its next stage of development work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jeff Pino, XTI's vice chairman and intended chief executive, held a <span class="companylink">Reddit</span> chat for potential investors and spoke enthusiastically about the venture's potential. ''How often do any of us get a chance to be part of something truly revolutionary?'' he wrote.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the technical solution, the team, and plan to get this done,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight days later, Mr. Pino died in a plane crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vintage fighter plane he was flying at the time was not made by XTI, which is still years away from having a functioning prototype, but his death in February was a cataclysm for the fledgling company. It raised an issue small businesses are rarely prepared to face: What happens when a founder or key executive unexpectedly dies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone pays lip service to succession planning, but it takes years, sometimes decades, before companies get around to it,'' said Frank P. Nagorney, a lawyer in Cleveland who specializes in succession issues. ''Early on, you're more worried about making payroll next week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a crisis hits, a company faces two challenges, either of which can be its undoing. First, someone has to step in and run day-to-day operations. Then the company must sort out its equity and ownership issues, which often entails selling all or a part of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some crucial decisions must be made while those who remain are in a state of shock and grief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Tang, a co-founder of Kitchit, a San Francisco start-up that lets customers book personal chefs, was just 24 when he was fatally struck by a car early in 2014 while walking around the city. Brendan Marshall, the company's chief executive, had to rapidly navigate a situation unlike any he had studied at <span class="companylink">Stanford's business school</span>, where the idea for Kitchit was hatched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All nonessential operations were suspended as Kitchit brought in a grief counselor and pulled together resources to help its close-knit staff of 12 cope with their loss. Mr. Marshall also faced an urgent problem: Mr. Tang, the company's chief technology officer, had a deeper technical skill set and knowledge of Kitchit's code base than anyone else on the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The broader tech community in San Francisco really came through,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''A whole bunch of engineers who were George's friends helped us.'' Chris Lambert, the technology chief at the ride-sharing company Lyft, was particularly essential in aiding junior programmers and helping Kitchit's executives make technical decisions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work resumed in fits and starts. Some people wanted to dive right back in, to give themselves something to focus on. It took about a month for Kitchit to resume its normal business rhythms, Mr. Marshall said, and when it did, its trajectory changed. With fewer technical resources, the company had to be ruthlessly disciplined about using them, and some expansion plans were halted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was actually a good exercise, because it forced us to focus on what we had built and on strengthening the core features instead of trying to offer a bunch of new services,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ripple effects of a founder's death can linger for a surprisingly long time. Companies at which a founding chief executive dies are statistically more likely to go out of business than otherwise similar ventures, and they typically experience a sharp sales drop and a moderate decrease in employment, according to research by two economists, Sascha O. Becker and Hans K. Hvide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair used data from Norway, which keeps extensive records on companies and their founders, to study the long-term effects of chief executives' deaths. The fallout was significantly worse for companies that lost a founder than for those that lost a nonfounder C.E.O., according to the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Becker said the greatest surprise, for him, was that the negative effects continue, and in some areas even intensify, five or more years after the entrepreneur's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You might think, O.K., the founder dies, someone takes over, the first one or two years there's a bit of mess until everyone gets used to the new leadership, and then the firm bounces back,'' he said. ''But these effects are sustained over years and years. There is no bounce-back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most small businesses are family-owned, and those kinds of companies rarely survive an unexpected death unless a relative is trained and ready to take over immediately. ''Most of the time, the family ends up selling for way below what it would have been worth if the business owner was there,'' Mr. Nagorney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate issues can force such fire sales. Unless heirs are directly involved in the business, Mr. Nagorney said, they often prefer to have any inherited ownership stake cashed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kitchit was lucky on that front. Mr. Tang died without a will. His parents, who live in Beijing, inherited his equity in the company, and have left it untouched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This company is very much part of George's legacy,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''His parents believe in that and have some comfort in it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years on, Kitchit has a staff of 23 and a new technology chief, and Mr. Marshall has become an unofficial Silicon Valley guide to dealing with a founder's death. Of the three companies he has counseled through similar situations, only one survived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">XTI is determined to keep up the momentum it had before Mr. Pino's death. Charles B. Johnson, the former president of the Cessna Aircraft Company and an active adviser to XTI, agreed within days to step in and become the company's interim chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was never any hesitation about whether we would continue,'' said David Brody, XTI's founder and chairman. ''We know that's what Jeff would have wanted, for us to keep going and bring this aircraft to market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But doing so will be bittersweet, Mr. Brody acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pino, 61, a former Army test pilot who spent decades in the commercial aviation industry, was deeply involved in XTI's development and passionate about the project's potential. He especially enjoyed working on the company's crowdfunding campaign, he told The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> in an unpublished interview shortly before he died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's so much young talent in the industry,'' he said. ''How do I say this nicely -- we at XTI have some runway left in our careers, but it's not the full runway. It's really fun, at this stage, to be learning new things and to be around people in crowdfunding who are creating so much buzz and excitement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">XTI's website now features a memorial tribute to Mr. Pino, and a pledge to make the company's experimental aircraft, a vertical-takeoff jet with helicopter-like features, a part of his lasting legacy: ''As a man with big ideas, and even bigger dreams, Jeff was committed to bringing the TriFan 600 to market, and now, more than ever, so are we.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business, Edison Energy, was announced on Tuesday and is aimed at helping large organizations like Fortune 500 companies take advantage of evolving technologies, markets and incentives in areas including energy efficiency, renewables and storage.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is among the first major forays of a utility into energy management services, and is one of the more ambitious examples of how power companies are adapting to customers' interest in producing and controlling their own electricity and the growing competition from ventures offering them the ability to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many utilities have tried to stem the flow of customers to alternative service providers, especially the new breed of rooftop solar installers, others are beginning to try to grab a piece of that business for themselves, whether teaming up with companies like Sunrun, a leading residential installer, or providing rooftop arrays themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This industry has historically been the ultimate in, 'You get it one way -- our way -- and at one price,''' Theodore F. Craver Jr., chief executive of Edison International, said in an interview on Thursday at his office here. ''But as customers experience much more customization in other industries, they start to ask, 'Why can't I have that here?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new business is set up to operate separately from Edison's utility, <span class="companylink">Southern California Edison</span>, which serves about five million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile area of central, coastal and southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will serve customers nationwide, executives said, and shows how changes in customer demand and expectations are beginning to force a shift in how the utility industry operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, these days, Mr. Craver said, <span class="companylink">Southern California Edison</span> buys roughly 85 percent of the electricity it sells to customers, owning the plants that produce only the balance of the power it provides.</p>

''Through Edison Energy, we want to help create this market for what one might call Energy-as-a-Service.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In partnership with ReD Associates, a consulting company that uses sociology and anthropology to examine changing markets, Edison spent more than a year studying corporate energy management to develop its strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After surveying and meeting with executives and energy managers at more than 500 businesses, researchers found that although energy represents one of the single biggest costs -- and one that is under increasing pressure from rising prices, price volatility and corporate sustainability goals -- there is little agreement on or understanding of how best to take advantage of new systems and technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial and industrial customers are looking not only to cut costs but also to take concrete, visible actions to meet sustainability goals. They often lack the expertise needed to, say, negotiate contracts to buy energy from a wind farm, participate in demand response programs or navigate the hodgepodge of local and federal incentives and rules governing installing solar panels or storage equipment on their own, energy and business specialists say. ReD researchers found that though energy is on the agendas of many corporate leaders, managing it is considered a distraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not really core to their business,'' said Allan J. Schurr, president of Edison Energy. ''Even though they've sometimes built staffs to manage that category, it's not the kind of investment they can continue to make to be best in class.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the electric industry has lagged in filling a perceived gap among companies seeking a credible energy services partner to help them navigate rapidly changing technologies, business models and regulatory policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just because you're comfortable making investments in real estate doesn't mean you're comfortable making investments in energy within your assets,'' said Louis Schotsky, who participated in the ReD research and is first vice president for investments at Equity Residential, a large apartment building owner. ''It's really, really hard to find people who can take a broad perspective on energy and come back to you with an even somewhat unbiased recommendation around what's best for your property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edison is hoping to fill that gap and, as part of the effort, has been acquiring other companies, including a rooftop solar installer and a business that helps large organizations buy clean energy. It plans to take advantage of its expertise in designing, building and managing electric systems, but to allow the new business, with a more entrepreneurial mandate and separate offices in Irvine, Calif., to be more nimble than the big electric company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have an industry that has a huge, capital-intensive infrastructure,'' Mr. Craver said, referring to the power business, ''it doesn't turn on a dime.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Throw a rock in any direction in Silicon Valley and it may strike a start-up incubator, one of the now-ubiquitous programs aimed at helping entrepreneurs nurture their ideas into full-fledged businesses with funding and advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrett Camp, a co-founder of Uber, and a few of his partners think that model may need tweaking.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Mr. Camp and his colleagues took the wraps off Expa, a start-up studio in San Francisco that claims to take a smaller-scale, more hands-on approach to helping new companies grow from idea to prototype to marketable product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expa has been operating since 2013, but the group announced that it was opening up Expa Labs, a new six-month program for start-ups based in New York and San Francisco wherein the companies receive $500,000 in backing, office space and mentoring from a five-person team. Expa also said it had raised $100 million from investors to put into new start-ups and expand the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do you want a class size of 100, or a class size of eight?'' said Mr. Camp, Expa's chief executive and general partner. ''What we're offering is something for founders who want a bit more guidance than they may find somewhere else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The timing for Expa's grand unveiling is hardly fortunate. Over the last six months, there has been a sharp pullback in venture deals in the United States, according to CB Insights, a firm that tracks venture capital. Some pockets of start-ups -- namely the youngest companies -- are still raising money, but those trying to drum up investor interest in later rounds of funding are facing a tougher time, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expa said the shift in the funding environment would actually help because the thinner the crowd of start-ups, the easier it was for the most successful ones to shine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just easier in these times for us to see who's serious about building a company,'' said Hooman Radfar, an Expa partner and founder of <span class="companylink">AddThis</span>, a marketing technology company that was acquired by <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In setting itself up as a smaller start-up studio, Expa is drawing a distinction between itself and Y Combinator, the most visible Silicon Valley incubator. Y Combinator often takes a large class of 100 or more start-up concepts and gives entrepreneurs time, money and advice. Many of the ventures fail, though some -- including <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and Twitch -- have flourished. The ''Y.C.'' stamp of approval now carries a certain pedigree in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expa's model is different. The firm focuses on a handful of start-ups at a time every six months. That way, one of Expa's five partners -- Mr. Camp, Mr. Radfar, Naveen Selvadurai, Roberto Sanabria and Milun Tesovic -- can devote personal attention and resources to the founders on a project, based on their particular area of expertise. Each partner claims ''ownership'' of a particular start-up, something the firm claims can be difficult for investors who put money into dozens of companies and so have little time to spend with each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Expa team also helps with practical services -- like handling the paperwork of establishing a Delaware C-Corp company or dealing with payroll for a team of engineers -- along with access to what it says is an extensive network of personal advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because the Expa companies share office space, the start-ups can easily bounce ideas and experiments off one another, the Expa partners said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Expa's model is mostly unproved. The Expa partners point to Uber as a model for how they would like to build other companies. Mr. Camp helped generate the idea for Uber and provided early funding for the ride-hailing service before handing the reins to Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive. (Uber was last valued at more than $62 billion.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Expa start-ups like Reserve, a company that deals with restaurant reservations, and Operator, a personal assistant application, have received modest early attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Y Combinator, which last had 126 companies go through its program, said its members still got one-on-one attention from advising partners, and the start-ups continue to benefit from being a Y.C. graduate. Justin Kan, a partner and spokesman for Y Combinator, said several successful start-ups -- including the T-shirt printing company Teespring, the on-demand delivery start-up <span class="companylink">Instacart</span> and the crowdfunding start-up Tilt -- had emerged since Y.C. began funding larger class sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expa faces competition far beyond Y Combinator. Traditional incubators like TechStars and 500 Startups also abound, and large corporations like <span class="companylink">Samsung</span>, <span class="companylink">Disney</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> offer internal start-up acceleration programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expa said its focus on ''quality, not quantity'' would make a difference. ''We are not playing the odds and investing in volume,'' the company said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThe juggle of work, school and myriad extracurricular activities is all too familiar to parents like Kelly Aluise of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her 12-year-old daughter, Emma, had enrolled in August for after-school surfing and swimming. Ms. Aluise and her ex-husband, who work full time, didn't know how they would get her to the activities. Complicating matters, Ms. Aluise's schedule as a real estate agent with Keller Williams is unpredictable.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't know how I was going to get Emma where she needed to be and do my job,'' she said. ''So I asked the school's principal what I should do and he handed me a brochure for HopSkipDrive.'' Ms. Aluise looked at the brochure and hugged him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She now schedules three rides a week for her daughter, which costs about $45 to $50 a week. While ride-hailing services have been popular in the start-up economy, new entrepreneurs are going after a specific niche: providing rides for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These start-ups are nibbling at the industry's fringes, where Uber and Lyft -- at least officially -- don't go. (Per policy at Uber and Lyft, drivers are not supposed to give rides to unaccompanied minors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they are still testing the waters in a small number of markets, the sector is already becoming competitive. It's part of a bigger trend of ride-hailing, with services finding ways to capture a very specific market segment, said Harry Campbell, who writes about the industry at his blog TheRideShareGuy.com and is a driver for Uber and Lyft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is Wingz, which specializes in airport rides; Lift Hero, which provides rides to older consumers; and Chariot for Women, set to start this month in Boston, aiming to serve women or children under age 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full-time working mothers started HopSkipDrive, which serves all of Los Angeles County and much of Orange County. The company has received $14.1 million in funding and said revenue was growing 30 percent monthly. It was preceded by Shuddle, which began in 2014 and has raised $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help reassure worried parents, these companies provide a level of safety and security that the Ubers of the world do not, including fingerprinting and extensive interviewing, and they use software that monitors the driver's speed and conduct. Many companies operating in California also rely on TrustLine certification, that state's official screening program for in-home caregivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all the drivers for these services are women -- often teachers, nannies, day care workers and mothers. Most companies carry insurance that exceeds state requirements and covers liability related to driver (or babysitter) conduct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These niche start-ups are also coming up at a time when there is industry skepticism about whether on-demand services can offer price and convenience competitively for the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a certain extent, many of these start-ups still compete against Uber or Lyft because many drivers for those companies don't know about the unaccompanied-minor policy or choose to look the other way once they have picked up an underage passenger. ''I would say between 10 and 20 percent of rides are minors and it's increasing,'' said Mr. Campbell, who corresponds with hundreds of drivers a day because of his blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As parents try these services, they are becoming more comfortable with the idea of allowing a stranger to drive their children. Ms. Aluise, for instance, receives a photo of the car and driver ahead of time, which she places inside her daughter's lunchbox. The driver wears a HopSkipDrive shirt and uses a password that confirms her identity to Emma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Aluise receives a text message when her daughter gets in the car and when she arrives at her destination, and during that time Emma is never unsupervised. Last year Ms. Aluise spent $150 a week for her babysitter to pick Emma up twice a week from school. ''I didn't know anything about her car either, so that was a little terrifying,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word-of-mouth marketing and referrals are crucial. ''Mom networks are very important for us,'' said Joanna McFarland, a co-founder and the chief executive of HopSkipDrive. ''We have found that when you solve one parent's problem and make their life easier, they will tell other parents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ride-hailing for children appears to have started in 2013 with Boost, a youth transportation service created by the business innovation group at <span class="companylink">Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America</span> in Sunnyvale, Calif. Boost serves the Silicon Valley area and is still considered a pilot program, although it's growing at a rate of 10 percent annually. Children are transported in Mercedes-owned vans, drivers are certified bus drivers, and there is a concierge on board to accompany children and engage them during the drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, entrepreneurs have offered additional services to consumers as they try to set themselves apart from the competition. Zum, which started in January in the San Francisco Bay Area, provides babysitting, if needed, in conjunction with rides for children ages 5 to 15. One of its drivers, for example, helps a single mother -- who has a 9 a.m. board meeting each week -- by arriving 45 minutes early to babysit her 5-year-old daughter, give her breakfast and get her to school, walking her to class and ensuring she is settled before leaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zum just completed a seed round of funding for a little more than $1 million. During its early phase, revenue and customers were growing 65 percent month over month. Today, the company provides 150 to 200 rides a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other start-ups, Zum allows parents to schedule rides ahead of time (even for the entire year) or call for an on-demand ride. All of Zum's drivers work either a morning or afternoon shift for five to six hours a day, so they rarely drive for other services, said Ritu Narayan, a co-founder of the company while she was a group product manager at eBay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One company in this sector has already repositioned itself in response to customer feedback. Kango, which serves the San Francisco Bay Area, started as KangaDo, a platform for parents seeking car pools in their neighborhoods. Although that function still exists, the company changed its model after parents said they wanted nonshared rides for their children and babysitting services. New customers can interview drivers or take a preliminary ride with them, which helps younger children get comfortable with a driver before taking a solo ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these companies have modest expansion plans, in large part because of the need to hire well-vetted drivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes a lot of work to keep supply and demand in balance, to keep the driver pool matched to the customer pool and remain 100 percent reliable, so we've taken very pragmatic views on growth,'' said Doug Aley, chief executive of Shuddle. ''The demand is there, but it's not the same as in other industries. If you don't get your groceries delivered it's not the end of the world, but we're talking about someone's child.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extra safety and security measures as well as other features translate to rides that are, on average, more expensive than a ride with Lyft or Uber. For example, HopSkipDrive's rides are about 10 to 15 percent higher and Kango's roughly 15 to 20 percent higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, higher fares are not seen as a deterrent because this business is driven, in part, by a force more powerful than economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One factor in this market people don't talk about is the guilt,'' said Ms. McFarland of HopSkipDrive. ''There's no shortage of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 15, 2016, Friday</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 12 last year, Hillary Clinton formally announced her run for the presidency by posting a two-­minute video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> . For the first minute and a half, Clinton was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the video showed a montage of a dozen or so Clinton supporters: a ­middle-­aged white woman tending to her garden; two Hispanic brothers starting a business; a pregnant young black woman and her husband unpacking boxes in a sun-­dappled suburban living room; a burly, bullet-headed white man surveying an American-­flag-­draped warehouse.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a carefully constructed portrait of the American middle class, or the parts of it that tend to vote Democratic -- like the patchwork of Carhartt and Ann Taylor that Barack Obama gathered around himself for a speech in Cincinnati early in the 2012 campaign, when he proclaimed himself a ''warrior for the middle class.'' American politicians genuflect toward the middle class so reflexively that failing to do so in a speech or a statement about the economy seems almost heretical -- which it turned out was the most remarkable thing about Clinton's video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the candidate materialized, she instead said this: ''Everyday Americans need a champion -- and I want to be that champion.'' Her omission of ''middle class'' was intentional. Amy Chozick of The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> wrote that the campaign planned to ''shy away from the characterization 'middle class' -- because, her advisers say, the term no longer connotes a stable life -- and instead use the term 'everyday Americans.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Benenson, Clinton's chief strategist and Obama's lead pollster, has thought a great deal about issues of class. In 2011, he embarked on an extensive project in which researchers conducted repeated interviews with about 100 middle-­income, middle-­aged swing voters in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio; Denver; and Orlando, Fla. ''It's been valuable,'' he told me recently, ''because it's important to know what kind of conventional assumptions about the middle class hold up and which don't. There's no question that there was a massive recalibration after the financial crash. People felt very strongly that the foundations -- what they had believed they would achieve by working hard, doing things right -- were not the same as they had been before.'' Public-­opinion surveys, too, show that something has shifted, sharply, in the American self-­definition. Last spring, a Gallup poll found that the percentage of respondents who identified as middle class or upper middle class dropped 12 percent since the 2008 financial crisis; nearly half of those polled identified themselves as either working or lower class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Clinton's use of ''everyday Americans'' proved to be short-­lived, perhaps because of its undeniably leaden ring. (Has anyone but Sly Stone ever self-identified as ''everyday''?) By September, Clinton had dropped the phrase entirely. Campaign officials conceded to The Times that it was confusing and, maybe, a bit too close to <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> 's ''Everyday Low Prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole episode revealed a fundamental tension underlying this year's anomalous presidential contest. America's self-­image as a middle-­class nation is so deeply ingrained in the country's politics that we don't often stop to think what, precisely, that means: whether it defines a concrete socioeconomic identity -- a country where most people are neither very rich nor very poor -- or an aspiration, the notion that if you ''work hard and play by the rules,'' as Clinton put it the first time she ran for president, you're entitled to at least a modest prosperity. ''Everyday Americans'' was an attempt to acknowledge that the gap between these two ideas has widened to the point that ignoring it seems out of touch. Yet in its reversal, the campaign inadvertently revealed just how ill ­equipped American politics is for a post-­middle-­class nation -- how deeply the way the country speaks of itself is tied up with these aspirations, even as more and more of its citizens come to see them as out of reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Donald Trump 's ascent in the polls last fall, the most confounding question in politics was who, exactly, his supporters were. A couple of weeks before the New Hampshire primary in February, Byron York, a journalist well sourced among Republican operatives, crisscrossed the state asking party grandees: ''Do you know anyone who supports Donald Trump ?'' ''In more cases than not,'' he wrote in The Washington Examiner, ''actually, in nearly all the cases, the answer was no.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the first election results and exit polls came in, Trump's voters seemed to be mostly high-­school-­educated white men, mostly making less than $50,000 a year. Perhaps more surprising, this description also fits, with some tailoring, the voters who have propelled the candidacy of Bernie Sanders. In mostly white New Hampshire, Sanders beat Clinton among voters making less than $50,000 a year by a staggering 33 percentage points -- twice as big as his margin with voters who made more than that -- and by 36 percentage points among voters without college degrees. In Michigan, whose suburban voters are one of the most-­watched barometers in American politics, the margins were narrower but still notable: Sanders won white voters without a college degree by 15 percentage points, and voters making less than $50,000 by 3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These insurgent candidates are capturing one of the two demographic groups that converged in the great middle-­class experiment that began seven decades ago. When people spoke of the middle class in the years immediately after World War II, they were typically talking about the group identified by the sociologist C.Wright Mills in his 1951 book, ''White Collar'': the usually college-­educated, deskbound employees of a newly technocratic, corporate economy. It was only a few years later that the definition was generally extended to include skilled blue-­collar workers, who were now earning solid incomes on account of a booming postwar industrial economy and of unions that made sure their members got an equitable piece of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The confluence of these two groups -- a vision of insurance salesmen and machine operators, mowing the lawns of adjoining split-­level ranches and talking about Sunday's game -- felt extraordinary even in its own time, seemingly incontrovertible proof that American capitalism worked. ''The fact is that America's booming new middle-­income class consists, to a startling extent, of groups hitherto identified as proletarians,'' Fortune reported in 1954. Instead of overthrowing the bourgeoisie, the proletariat had joined it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new middle-­class utopia did, of course, exclude most nonwhite Americans. Although average incomes for nonwhites increased at about the same rate as incomes for whites in the postwar years, in 1959 the black poverty rate was still 56 percent, and blacks on average earned 53 percent what whites did. What could be said for the midcentury middle class, though, is that it generally worked astonishingly well for those who were lucky enough to be part of it -- particularly for blue-­collar workers. Probably no one in American history has achieved prosperity with the velocity of the men who grew up destitute in the Depression and, by their 30s, had factory jobs that paid (in 2016 dollars) upward of $50,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The white- and blue-­collar middle classes each tended to vote Democratic, which made sense: The new middle class's good fortune was the combined product of the New Deal, postwar Keynesian economic policy, the G.I. Bill, organized labor and government-­backed mortgages. But in retrospect, the Democrats' hold on the white middle class was balanced precariously on the racial status quo -- which, by the mid-­1960s, was breaking apart. George Wallace, the segregationist Democratic governor of Alabama who ran for president in 1964 in protest of Lyndon B. Johnson's turn toward civil rights, performed well not just in the South but also in white blue-­collar enclaves in the few Northern states where he was on the primary ballot. When he ran again as an independent in 1968, the members of the <span class="companylink">United Auto Workers Union</span> local at the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> plant in Flint, Mich., voted to endorse him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1984, the extent of the damage to the Democrats' postwar coalition had become clear. That spring, Ronald Reagan's campaign aired its ''Morning in America'' ad, a Vaseline-­lensed montage of overwhelmingly white suburban prosperity. Walter Mondale -- the son of a small-­town Minnesota minister whose politics radiated an austere, Scandinavian morality -- spent the last days of his campaign unfurling increasingly dire pictures of urban and rural poverty and beseeching people to vote for an ''America of fairness.'' Speaking bitterly of Reagan's commercial, he told a crowd at a church in Cleveland: ''It's all picket fences and puppy dogs. No one's hurting. No one's alone. No one's hungry. No one's unemployed. No one gets old. Everybody's happy.'' But Americans liked the picket fences and puppy dogs. Reagan swept every state in the country save Minnesota and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long afterward, Stanley Greenberg, a 40-­year-­old Yale political scientist who moonlighted as a political pollster, was contacted by a group of Democratic Party and union officials in Michigan. They asked him to help explain what had happened that November in Macomb County outside Detroit. In 1960, Macomb voted for John F. Kennedy by a larger margin than any suburban county in the country. In 1984, it voted for Reagan by a margin of 33 percentage points. ''The sense was that if we could figure out what happened in Macomb County, Democrats would go a long way toward righting the ship,'' Rick Wiener, the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party at the time, told me recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sense, what had happened was obvious. The postwar suburbs in general had been a racial fortress, their homogeneity enforced by a web of government policies and unofficial restrictions making it difficult for nonwhites to own property in them, and few more so than Detroit's. The white ex-­Democrats whom Greenberg's team interviewed, he later wrote, ''expressed a profound distaste for black Americans, a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics. Blacks constituted the explanation for their vulnerability and for almost everything that had gone wrong in their lives; not being black was what constituted being middle class.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Greenberg noted, Macomb voters had not defected en masse from the Democratic Party until after years of worsening economic circumstances -- and until they perceived the Democrats as not only having taken up the banner of the urban poor and nonwhites but also having abandoned the white middle class. ''These voters wondered why they weren't the central drama of the Democratic Party,'' Greenberg wrote. Greenberg suggested that Democrats offer a kind of grand bargain to the white middle-­class voters he called ''Reagan Democrats'': The Democrats would reinstate the middle class as the gravitational center of the party's economic policy if those voters accepted an expanded definition of who was included in the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the Democrats who took Greenberg's advice was Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who used the Macomb study as the playbook for his 1992 presidential campaign, which he built around the theme of ''the forgotten middle class.'' Speaking to voters in Macomb County in March 1992, he offered a near-­verbatim recitation of Greenberg's proposal: ''The one thing that it's going to take to bring this country together is somebody's got to come back to the so-­called Reagan Democratic area and say: 'Look, I'll give you your values back. I'll restore the economic leadership, I'll help you build the middle class back.' But you've got to say, 'O.K., let's do it with everybody in this country.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can see, in Clinton's 1992 campaign, the basic architecture of how politicians, and many Americans, talk about the middle class today -- not just the more diverse picture of American prosperity that politicians of both parties must at least pay lip service to, but also a more expansive economic definition of what the middle class is. In the first year of his presidency, Clinton created a new top income-­tax bracket, starting at $250,000 (nearly $420,000 in today's dollars). This is as close as we have to a concrete upper bound for what counts, in political discourse, as the middle class; the ''middle class'' tax policies of Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all apply to earners with incomes of $250,000 or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bill Clinton was acknowledging, presciently, a skewing of the American economy that has only worsened since his presidency, the steady pulling away of the superrich from everyone else -- the division between the 99 percent and the 1 percent. But the more politically meaningful divergence may be one happening further down the economic spectrum. Richard V. Reeves, a scholar at the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span> , argues that the most significant dividing line in recent American experience isn't between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, but between the 80 percent and the 20 percent -- a group that includes not just the very rich but also people most Americans would identify as upper middle class. This is where you draw the line if you're interested not in absolute wealth but in the trajectory of wealth -- not whether you have a yacht docked in St. Bart's, but whether you're doing better than you were five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the phrase ''everyday Americans'' tried to preserve a sense of common identity while acknowledging the fragmented economic realities of the 21st-­century middle class, it also demonstrated just how difficult that is to do. Consider the different experiences of two groups that sit mostly within what the Democrats' tax policies, at least, define as the middle class: The top 20 percent saw its average real household income rise to $185,000 in 2013 from about $109,000 a year in 1967. The middle 40 percent saw their real incomes rise, too, but to only $68,000 from $52,000 -- the equivalent of a $348-­a-­year raise. The top 20 percent is also more likely than the middle 40 percent to believe that hard work gets you ahead in life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fissures have also deepened between the two halves of the postwar middle class: between college-­educated, mostly white-­collar workers and high-­school-­educated, mostly blue-­collar workers. According to a Brookings study released last year, men and women with bachelor's degrees earned a median of 7 percent and 16 percent more in 2013 than they did in 1990. Women who either didn't attend college or attended but didn't graduate made just 3 percent more -- up to a meager $29,500 -- and those men made 13 percent less: a median of $40,700 a year, down from $47,100 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aspirational idea of the middle class spoke to the notion that even if Americans were in various stages of prosperity, they were all understood to be heading in the same general direction. But what happens when that's no longer true? On one end of the ''middle class'' spectrum is a dream inexorably receding from view; on the other is a pair of socioeconomic blinders obscuring the harsher economic realities of those further down the scale. ''The upper middle class are surprised by the rise of Trump,'' Reeves told me. ''The actual middle class are surprised we're surprised.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, New York -- a city not accustomed to being second banana -- has looked on as Silicon Valley has solidified its influence over the technology industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, New York has added tens of thousands of good-paying tech jobs while the Wall Street job engine has sputtered. And the city's start-ups pulled in $1.94 billion in venture funding in the first three months of this year, the most for any quarter in five years and second only to Silicon Valley, according to the research firm CB Insights.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the big hit -- the next <span class="companylink">Google</span> or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or even <span class="companylink">Salesforce</span>, a powerhouse in online services for business -- has proved elusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To improve the odds of fostering that next big thing in New York, executives at tech start-ups, big tech companies and venture firms are creating a new policy and advocacy organization, Tech:NYC. The nonprofit will be formally announced at an event this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech:NYC has no set agenda yet. But its approach, said Julie Samuels, the executive director, will be to work early with city, state and federal officials on issues that affect tech companies, before laws are passed. Some broader issues like taxes, schools and affordable housing also help determine whether people want to work and live in a city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York is in a competition to be where start-ups are going to locate and bigger tech companies are going to grow second and third offices,'' Ms. Samuels said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new organization arrives at a time when the path ahead for the local tech economy is uncertain. New York, it seems, has become fertile ground for start-ups, but has very few breakout winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been some notable failures. In the last two years, Fab, an e-commerce marketplace for designer furniture, housewares and other merchandise, and Quirky, an online network for inventors, both collapsed, losing hundreds of millions of dollars for venture investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley venture firms suffered some of the biggest losses on those New York start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, <span class="companylink">Foursquare</span>, a social app that uses location technology, raised $45 million, but at a price that cut its valuation nearly in half. And the <span class="companylink">Gilt Groupe</span>, a fashion e-commerce service, was sold to the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span>, the department store conglomerate that owns <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span>, for $250 million, about quarter of its onetime valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-ups are inherently risky. That is why venture capital firms invest in a broad portfolio of companies, so a few winners can make up for the losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, it is not the setbacks that stand out as much as the scarcity of lucrative paydays -- start-ups sold to the public or to other corporations for $1 billion or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been a few over the years. In 2007, for example, <span class="companylink">Google</span> paid $3.1 billion for <span class="companylink">DoubleClick</span>, an online ad-serving service. In 2013, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> bought Tumblr, a microblogging platform, for $1.1 billion. Last year, <span class="companylink">Etsy</span>, an online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods, went public at a valuation of $1.8 billion, and traded above that for a while but has since retreated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet those are exceptions. ''Big exits really haven't happened yet in New York,'' said Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, a New York venture capital firm. ''It's a valid criticism.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should gradually change, he argued, as the New York tech community matures. Mr. Wilson also said that New York entrepreneurs were influenced by the trading culture of Wall Street. They are more inclined, he said, to build a company, sell it, cash in and move to the next one than some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who dream bigger and view their company as their life's work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study last year by Compass, a research firm, pointed to the potential of New York, and to how far behind the Bay Area it is. The study looked at various factors including the funding, market reach, talent pool and start-up experience of various locations to come up with a ranking of ''global start-up ecosystems,'' excluding China, Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York ranked second over all, but was way behind by some measures. Compass estimated the value of all Bay Area start-ups -- including sales to companies, public offerings and private valuations -- at $264 billion to $323 billion. The comparable estimate for New York start-ups was $41 billion to $50 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the New York tech economy has shown impressive job growth. An analysis by Jason Bram, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, concluded that from 2007 to 2015 New York tech employment grew by more than 60 percent, to 126,170 workers. By contrast, tech employment in the Bay Area was more than 370,000 as of 2014, the most recent figure in the Fed analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap is hardly surprising, given Silicon Valley's decades-long head start and singular focus. ''Technology innovation and entrepreneurship -- that's our business in the Valley,'' said Steve Blank, an entrepreneur who lectures on technology and innovation at Stanford, Columbia and <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, Mr. Blank said, ''tech start-ups have been layered on top of the city's existing industries,'' including advertising, media and finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But New York is increasingly a place for the deeper computer science for which Silicon Valley is known. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, for example, has a large artificial intelligence lab in New York, headed by Yann LeCun, who is also a professor at N.Y.U. And there are now A.I. start-ups in New York, including Clarifai and Geometric Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia and N.Y.U. have also strengthened their engineering departments and added programs in new fields like data science and machine learning, and are increasingly working with start-ups and nurturing spinoff ventures. Cornell Tech, founded in Manhattan in 2012, is dedicated to tech entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And tech giants like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">IBM</span> have been aggressively hiring engineering talent for their New York outposts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some New York tech start-ups, the proximity to the industries they serve is essential. Sprinklr, for example, provides cloud software that allows major brands like <span class="companylink">Nike</span> and <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> to monitor their reputations and marketing on social networks like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sprinklr works closely with the New York advertising and marketing community. ''We're an ideal company to be here,'' said Ragy Thomas, its founder and chief executive. His start-up has raised $125 million in venture funding and is valued at $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Charles Phillips took over as chief executive at <span class="companylink">Infor</span>, a business software company, he decided to move the headquarters to New York. <span class="companylink">Infor</span> had been based in Atlanta, mainly because of the previous management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So <span class="companylink">Infor</span> was destined to relocate, and since it had hundreds of developers in the Bay Area, the board assumed the move would be there. ''They thought I was crazy choosing New York, but they went along with it,'' recalled Mr. Phillips, a former senior executive at Oracle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York, he figured, was closer to many of its corporate customers, making in-person meetings more convenient. And because <span class="companylink">Infor</span>'s software was being overhauled for ease of use, he has hired software developers from New York advertising companies and fashion houses as well as the Parsons School of Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've picked up some great programmers who understand design,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''And I wanted my engineers to be around people who weren't all engineers.''</p>

Renaud Laplanche and his crew steered a 105-foot racing boat through New York Harbor one day last spring, its towering sails ripping across the water at 30 knots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An accomplished sailor and founder of <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, Mr. Laplanche was hosting executives from hedge funds, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and other banks -- part of his effort to win over Wall Street on his plans to upend traditional banking with a faster, more democratic form of lending.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He already had endorsements from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, and John Mack, the former chief of Morgan Stanley, who joined his board. At <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s initial public offering in December 2014, the company was valued at over $8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Monday, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> announced that Mr. Laplanche had resigned after an internal investigation found improprieties in its lending process, including the altering of millions of dollars' worth of loans. The company's stock price, already reeling in recent months, fell 34 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's woes are part of a broader reckoning in the online money-lending industry. Last week, Prosper, another online lender that focuses on consumers, laid off more than a quarter of its work force, and the chief executive said he was forgoing his salary for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems at <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, in particular, threaten to confirm some of Wall Street's worst fears:that as favorable economic conditions begin to turn, they will reveal many upstart companies with weak internal controls that have been feeding inaccurate information to starry-eyed investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is clear this is bad news not just for <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, but for our entire industry,'' Peter Renton, who founded Lendit, a leading industry conference, wrote in a blog post on Monday. ''Really bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketplace lenders like <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> have created easy-to-use websites that match consumers and small businesses, hoping to borrow a few thousand dollars, with individuals or Wall Street investors looking to lend money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freed from the costs of brick-and-mortar branches and federal regulations requiring that they reserve money against their loans, marketplace lenders have been able to grow quickly and with fewer expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process is almost entirely online, with loans approved in days rather than the weeks a traditional bank might take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While marketplace loans account for less than 1 percent of the consumer loans in the United States, a recent report by the investment bank Jefferies said that in some segments -- like installment loans -- the new lending companies account for more than 10 percent of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just months ago, it seemed marketplace lenders couldn't churn out loans fast enough. Investors like hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds were clamoring to buy large pools of these loans, which offered an attractive return at a time of record low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the first quarter, lenders like <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, Prosper and <span class="companylink">OnDeck Capital</span> had difficulty convincing investors that their business models are sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the majority of the companies' borrowers continue to pay their loans on time, Wall Street investors have started to worry about the prospect of increasing defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the small business lender <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> said demand for securitized packages of its loans had all but vanished in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors are shooting first and asking questions later,'' said Christopher C. Brendler, a financial analyst at Stifel, the investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's waning demand for loans exposed the Achilles' heel of marketplace lending. Unlike traditional banks that use their deposits to fund loans, the marketplace companies discovered how fleeting their funding sources can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the start of the year, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> has raised interest rates on its loans three times to sweeten their appeal to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the pressure to sell loans mounted across the industry, the problems began to surface at <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, according to two people briefed on the company's internal investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said that in early April, a <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> employee discovered that the dates on about $3 million of loan applications appeared to have been altered in some way. The employee raised the issue with Mr. Laplanche, who alerted the company's internal auditor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That inquiry led to the discovery of more irregularities, these two people said. This time, it appeared that about $22 million in loans that had been sold to Jefferies did not meet the investment bank's criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the discrepancy was fairly minor, they said the <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> board considered it a serious issue. The company bought back all of the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A key principle of the company is maintaining the highest levels of trust with borrowers, investors, regulators, stockholders and employees,'' Hans Morris, who on Monday was named <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s executive chairman, a newly created role, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two people briefed on the internal investigation said it had turned up another issue. Mr. Laplanche had a stake in an investment fund that the company was also considering whether to invest in. But Mr. Laplanche had failed to disclose his personal investment to the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laplanche did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laplanche, in many ways, was considered the face of his industry. He is a French-born lawyer who spent the early part of his career at Cleary Gottlieb, a large corporate law firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He came up with the idea to start <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> in 2006 after seeing how little banks paid people to deposit their money and how much those same banks charged to lend. ''We wanted to lower the spread,'' he said in an interview last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laplanche is also a world-class sailor who holds two speed records. He would frequently take his staff in San Francisco sailing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday, the board informed Mr. Laplanche of its conclusions, making it clear that he had lost its confidence. Three senior managers involved in the loan sales have either resigned or were fired. The company's president, Scott Sanborn, was named acting chief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recent turmoil, more traditional banks were putting faith in the industry's underwriting models and low-cost lending system. The banks had been buying loans from the marketplace lenders and also forming partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, for example, started a partnership with <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> to offer small-business loans. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>, the nation's largest bank, figured that <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> could offer the loans more cheaply and quickly than if the bank processed them internally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts predict that if the funding pressure continues, large banks could end up acquiring the marketplace lenders, or pieces of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have good technology and it could ultimately be adopted by the banks themselves,'' said Todd H. Baker, founder of Broadmoor Consulting, which advises financial services companies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which serves as an online matchmaker between small-business borrowers and individual and institutional lenders, disclosed the grand jury subpoena in a regulatory filing, saying it intended to cooperate with the federal investigation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, which is based in San Francisco, revealed that its founder and chief, Renaud Laplanche, had resigned after an internal investigation discovered fabrications in about $3 million of loan applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The internal inquiry turned up other problems, including the sale of $22 million of loans to the investment bank Jefferies that <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> employees knew did not meet certain of Jeffries's specifications.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a broad new class of workers becoming eligible for overtime, many small businesses are scrambling to figure out how to factor the regulations into their bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration on Wednesday announced the final details of new labor rules to increase the salary cutoff for overtime pay. Although the plan was outlined a year ago and employers have several months to comply, many say the change will be a challenge to small businesses that pride themselves on a scrappy, entrepreneurial culture.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are pretty flexible,'' said Kelli Glasser, who is president and chief executive of Exhibit Concepts, a 100-employee company in Dayton, Ohio, that designs, builds and manages exhibits for museums and trade shows. '' If somebody needs to pick up a sick kid or go to a doctor's appointment, we let them do it because we know that at some point they'll make up for it. Once you start tracking hours, that all changes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, salaried employees who earn more than $23,660 a year and meet other criteria are not entitled by law to overtime pay, which is 1.5 times an equivalent hourly wage after an employee works more than 40 hours a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threshold is scheduled to roughly double, to $47,476, on Dec. 1. That means millions of workers who were salaried will have to have their hours tracked to see if they qualify for overtime pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers will have various options. They could change the pay structure for employees making less than the new threshold to an hourly rate. They could raise the pay above the threshold so they won't need to worry about overtime. They could even cut the base salaries of those who regularly work more than 40 hours, in expectation that overtime pay will make up the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the business owners unsure of what adjustments to make is Lior Rachmany, the chief executive and founder of Dumbo Moving &amp; Storage in New York. After hearing about the new threshold, he started examining how it would affect his 185 employees, 50 percent of whom are paid a salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rachmany said he was reluctant to move so many additional workers to an hourly scale. ''I think you get a better product when people are paid a salary,'' he said. ''When a person knows there is a task to get done, it will get done, not on the clock.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rachmany said he would probably end up hiring more entry-level employees and minimizing overtime pay for his affected salaried employees. He is also considering hiring freelancers and independent contractors. By doing so, he could increase operations in busy times and not have overtime be a yearlong worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established the rules governing which employees qualified for overtime pay. For salaried employees to be classified as exempt from overtime, they must meet certain criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, their roles typically need to be administrative, executive, professional or managerial. Currently, to be excluded from overtime, they also must earn at least $23,660 a year, or $455 a week, a figure that was last adjusted in 2004. Before that, the rate had been $250 a week since 1975. Had that amount been adjusted for inflation, it would be more than $52,000 in today's dollars, according to the <span class="companylink">Economic Policy Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department calculated that 4.2 million workers would be affected by the higher overtime level, but the <span class="companylink">Economic Policy Institute</span> estimated that the higher pay threshold would give 12.5 million more employees, or 23 percent of salaried workers, a new or stronger right to overtime pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although businesses have had a lot of practice over the years adjusting for minimum wage increases for hourly employees in cities and states around the country, this rule change will be a significant shift for many small businesses and entrepreneurs, advisers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And unlike changes to the federal minimum wage, changes to the overtime threshold do not require an act of Congress, said Dan Bosch, a regulatory expert with the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, a prominent small-business trade group based in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of last month, many companies weren't even aware that the changes were imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Across the board, nobody seems to know about this,'' Adam Ochstein, the founder and chief executive of StratEx, a Chicago firm that provides human resources consulting and software to small and midsize businesses, said in an interview in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short period of time before the new rules take effect is worrisome to some business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not opposed to the change, but what I'm worried about is that it is such a huge increase, more than double, and it's sudden,'' said Ms. Glasser of Exhibit Concepts. ''When we talk about minimum wage increases, those are being phased in most places. For this, there is no phase-in period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the new threshold is expected to be the same across the country, with no adjustments for local conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One amount is being applied nationwide, and it is not necessarily applicable in all markets,'' Ms. Glasser said. In Dayton, Ohio, the median household income was $46,697 in 2014, the latest figure available from the <span class="companylink">United States Census Bureau</span>. In San Francisco, the median was $83,222.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another drawback, she said, was the precedent it would set for unmerited raises. And there is also the risk of a trickle-up effect: Employees not affected by the change might expect to see an increase in pay as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the employees who would benefit may be unhappy with the rule change. ''A lot of salaried employees aren't going to want to track their hours, even if it's to their benefit,'' said John Swanciger, chief executive of Manta, an online community of more than three million small-business owners. Manta recently surveyed its members about the pending regulations and found that more than half were unaware of the coming changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opting out of the rule is not a choice for companies with any employees who make less than the threshold, said John P. Quirke, a lawyer and partner with <span class="companylink">McCarter &amp; English</span> in East Brunswick, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice of comp time -- giving employees who work extra time a day off down the road -- will also change. With the new rules, for employees in the private sector making less than $47,476 a year, comp time will not be an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Public entities can offer comp time, but it's illegal for private employers to do so,'' Mr. Quirke said. Employers can define what constitutes a workweek, but any work beyond 40 hours in that week will be considered overtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small organizations should start by determining which employees could be affected. ''I think the biggest issue will be with employees routinely working 45 or 50 hours a week and happily making $40,000 to $45,000 a year,'' he said. ''Companies will need to figure out what to do with them: Reduce their hours or bump their pay?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For companies with employees who earn less than the threshold but have predictable hours, the easiest strategy may be to do nothing at all. That is, reclassify them as nonexempt and limit their overtime hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They will still need to track their hours, even if they're salaried,'' said Mr. Ochstein of StratEx, who added that such employers would need to keep close tabs on hours worked to ensure that overtime costs were under control. ''Don't have people working 60 or 70 hours a week,'' he said. ''If they are, increase their salary enough so they are exempt or hire more people for those roles.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- When Jeremy Hitchcock raised money for his technology start-up in 2012, he barely had to break a sweat. He was flooded with emails from venture capitalists who wanted in. Two months after meeting an investor over cocktails at a technology conference, he scored $38 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year, as valuations of tech start-ups wobbled and public tech stocks gyrated, Mr. Hitchcock, 34, was faced with a different dynamic. As he tried to garner new capital for his company Dyn, which monitors and reroutes Internet traffic, potential investors peppered him with questions others had once glossed over. How would Dyn produce a return for them? Did Dyn have the size and scale to go public?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dyn announced this month that it had raised $50 million from a private equity firm. But as part of the discussion, Mr. Hitchcock, who has not run a public company, agreed to step down as chief executive so Dyn could find a leader skilled in developing a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The talks were much more thorough'' with investors this time, Mr. Hitchcock said, adding that he had been thinking about resigning as chief executive before the fund-raising round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balance of power is shifting across tech start-up land. Not long ago, entrepreneurs had the upper hand. With investors eager to get a piece of the next Uber or <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, entrepreneurs often just lifted their little fingers to get financing. Some investors let the entrepreneurs choose their own terms, while others gave multimillion-dollar paydays to start-up founders long before their companies were a success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now investors have the advantage. Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a start-up's prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Venture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,'' said Venky Ganesan, a partner at <span class="companylink">Menlo Ventures</span>, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into start-ups in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>; funding dropped 11 percent to $12.1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have also been better able to negotiate financing terms that benefit them. According to a survey from the law firm <span class="companylink">Fenwick &amp; West</span>, investors of richly valued start-ups have been getting more provisions such as guaranteed payouts and minimum investment gains. Such terms are still relatively rare, but tend to become more common after the number and size of deals decline, said Barry Kramer, a <span class="companylink">Fenwick &amp; West</span> partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, investors are no longer paying any price to invest in a start-up. Since the beginning of this year, about 30 companies have had to settle for lower valuations than they previously received when they raised money, according to the research firm CB Insights. That is nearly as many as in all of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors have materially more time to do diligence than before,'' said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Khosla Ventures</span>. ''Across our portfolio, even for the best companies, fund-raising is a longer process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ling added that while particularly strong companies were being funded as always, valuations for others were generally flat to about 20 percent lower than this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One start-up whose valuation was recently reduced was CARD. com, an online banking start-up. The Los Angeles-based company closed a $5.5 million financing round in February that valued it lower than its last funding round in December 2014, something known in industry parlance as a down round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ben Katz, CARD.com's chief executive, said it was growing by 3,000 new accounts a day, had its first month with $1 million in revenue in February and should have $1 billion in new deposits this year. Even so, Mr. Katz, 37, was pragmatic about taking money at a lower valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Entrepreneurs shouldn't be too stressed by a down round as long as they are getting the capital they need to build their vision,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital firms that might have invested outside of their comfort zone in boom times have now reverted to form, said Justin Langseth, chief executive of Zoomdata, a data analytics start-up. When he tried to raise money at the end of last year, many venture capitalists deemed Zoomdata, which is four years old, too big or too small for their liking, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, they would have probably tried to stretch to accommodate a company of my size,'' said Mr. Langseth, 41, who landed $25 million from a group led by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As venture capitalists have become pickier, some entrepreneurs are looking for money from nontraditional financiers. Jon Stein, who runs the financial advisory start-up Betterment, found that many venture capitalists were telegraphing that they wanted a piece of his company for a lower price. So he looked beyond venture capitalists, turning to a Swedish investment firm, Kinnevik, to lead his start-up's latest financing of $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein, 36, said some start-ups were postponing fund-raising in the hope that they would have more leverage later. ''They're trying to build more traction,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the shifting power balance come shifting messages from investors. Whereas investors once worshiped growth at nearly any cost at a start-up, many are now more concerned about profitability, entrepreneurs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Yoshimura, 25, who invests in young companies and is chairman of the online jewelry business Ice.com, said his start-ups had generally eschewed raising large amounts of money to control spending. Yet some investors in recent years encouraged him and the companies he has invested in to take a lot of money and spend it on marketing and other growth tactics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he is bemused to hear that investors are suggesting smaller rounds, less spending and a focus on not losing money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone told us we were wrong last year, that we needed to spend,'' Mr. Yoshimura said. ''Now when you say you're profitable, everyone wants to invest.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olivier Stern, a 31-year-old French socialist with an appetite for risk, recently invested a third of his life savings -- 10,000 euros, about $11,000 -- in a cryptocurrency start-up that has no legal standing and runs head-on into regulatory obstacles, yet might very well upend the mysterious world of virtual investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up, a sort of venture capital fund that calls itself the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, has essentially come out of nowhere in the last month and attracted about $152 million, at last count, from investors around the world like Mr. Stern -- making it the most successful crowdfunded venture ever, by a significant margin.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture, like so many things related to the digital currencies that cryptographers are creating on the Internet, is difficult to describe, and it may not be legal. But thousands of mostly anonymous investors have already heard about it through word of mouth and sent money -- in the form of Ether, a freshly coded form of currency that has held itself out as a new and improved version of Bitcoin, the most popular virtual scrip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For these investors, in some sense it is the digital equivalent of buying into a bakery with no baker, no menu and no assurance that the ovens will even be delivered. But among the crowd that has invested, faith in the computer code that governs the project appears strong enough to override all those concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After it collects Ether from investors -- the deadline to buy in is May 28 -- the D.A.O. aims to put the money into other digital currency start-ups. The investing decisions are to be made through online polling of shareholders like Mr. Stern, who has a day job dealing with parking policy in the town of Montreuil, just outside Paris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is the beginning of something that could, in a way, make history,'' said Mr. Stern, who previously lost a small sum of money he invested in Bitcoin when a major Bitcoin exchange -- <span class="companylink">Mt. Gox</span> -- went bust. ''Maybe it can fail, maybe it can succeed, but for sure it is an idea that is very interesting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of the new venture comes at a time when the technology underlying virtual currencies is rapidly being embraced by the mainstream: Most Wall Street firms and many central banks are experimenting with the blockchain, the online ledger system that Bitcoin and Ether pioneered. Banks hope the blockchain, or something like it, can provide a faster, cheaper way of conducting transactions and storing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.A.O., on the other hand, returns to the more radical ambitions of virtual currencies. It is set up according to computer code, with no human executives. All decisions will be made by votes of the people who buy in -- using software -- making it a sort of technology-enabled leaderless collective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic code was written by a 32-year-old German programmer, Christoph Jentzsch. But he is not set to have any continuing role, and the D.A.O. does not hold the money of investors; instead, the investors own D.A.O. tokens that give them rights to vote on potential projects. Mr. Jentzsch said on Wednesday in an interview that he thought the structure absolved him of any legal responsibility for what could happen with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course this venture is fraught with risks,'' Mr. Jentzsch said in an email. But he also predicted, ''This technology represents the future of the Internet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts on virtual currencies say that Mr. Jentzsch and others involved have stepped into dangerous regulatory legal territory. American regulators have previously come down hard on entrepreneurs who sold investments using virtual currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Murck, a lawyer who has long dealt with Bitcoin issues, said that even if Mr. Jentzsch and his collaborators were not operating the venture, they could face legal liability for promoting it if the investments go awry -- and, potentially, even if they don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't code away your legal responsibilities,'' said Mr. Murck, who is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard. ''This is something that has been tried before and has failed before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Wednesday, an Ether was valued at $13 and a Bitcoin at $450 -- evidence, perhaps, of the strangeness and subjectivity of these new currencies. The D.A.O.'s reliance on Ether has allowed people to send their money to it from anywhere in the world without providing any identifying information, a design that is already raising concerns about potential money laundering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.A.O. has also faced difficult questions from virtual currency aficionados, who worry that the organization's code was put together relatively hastily without the sort of security testing that has preceded previous projects based on <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span>, the technology platform that underpins Ether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an unstable thing right now,'' said Joseph Lubin, who was one of the founders of <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span>. ''Young, complex machines tend to have flaws and vulnerabilities that you can't anticipate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jentzsch acknowledged that he did not anticipate the venture growing to anything close to the size it has reached. The biggest similar projects have attracted a few million dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I would have known the size it has grown to, maybe the tester in me would say, 'I need more testing,''' he said. ''This is very risky. It's all new land.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, two projects have applied to the D.A.O. for funding. One of them is a company run by Mr. Jentzsch and his brother, Simon, that is creating a new kind of physical lock that can be controlled remotely through the <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> network, according to contracts written into the network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The code that Mr. Jentzsch wrote for the organization has several safeguards that would make it hard for him or anyone else to game the voting of shareholders to win investments. But even successful crowdfunding sites do not have a great track record of harnessing the enthusiasm of users to pick good investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creator of a now defunct crowdfunding site fueled by Bitcoin, BitShares, wrote a biting online post on Tuesday arguing that the D.A.O. would most likely fail for the same reason that BitShares ultimately failed: ''people problems, economic problems and political problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My opinion is that the D.A.O. will be D.O.A. (Dead on Arrival),'' Daniel Larimer, the founder of BitShares, wrote. ''The theory of jointly deciding to fund efforts will face the reality of individual self-interest, politics and economics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of failure did not deter Mr. Stern, the Frenchman who put in the equivalent of $11,000. He said he thought the D.A.O. would provide a good financial return, but he was also motivated by his belief that the venture is an experiment in a new way of organizing companies, and potentially even governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's important for people to propose and try an alternative,'' he said.</p>

Trump for receiving grant money intended for small-business owners after the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nadler's broadside against Mr. Trump is the latest salvo in efforts by Democrats to illustrate his use of various loopholes over the years to help his businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, frequently invoked New York's post-9/11 resilience to combat criticism from his primary rivals over his New York roots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nadler described those words by Mr. Trump as ''exploitation'' of the city's darkest day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When do you plan on returning the taxpayer money that was designated to ease the suffering of our city's small-business owners?'' Mr. Nadler wrote in the letter, a copy of which his office provided to The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was referring to reports that Mr. Trump had received $150,000 from the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant program for his property at 40 Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been reported that on your grant application, you claimed 40 Wall Street L.L.C. -- which employed 28 people and had $26.8 million in annual revenues at the time -- as a 'small business,''' Mr. Nadler wrote. ''Despite the federal definition of a small business as having less than $6 million in revenue, you accepted a $150,000 payout.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''In grabbing that money with both fists, you took it out of the pockets of small-business owners in New York who were truly hurting, and prevented them from taking full advantage of the relief so generously offered by their fellow citizens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nadler pointed out that Mr. Trump had later been quoted in a television interview saying none of his properties were harmed in the attacks. Mr. Nadler also made a demand: ''Return the funds you received or donate them to a charitable organization dedicated to providing legitimate support for the victims of 9/11.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump recently made his first trip and first donation to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, at the site of the devastation. He has not taken a position on the proposed extension of a bill providing health benefits to recovery workers who became ill at the World Trade Center site during the months of cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to Mr. Nadler, Mr. Trump said, ''The company received this small amount of money after qualifying, given the limited number of employees working at the property,'' he said, adding, ''For many months, I allowed people to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was happy to do it and to this day I am still being thanked for the many people I helped. The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of computer scientists released a paper on Friday describing a number of security vulnerabilities in a novel cryptocurrency crowdfunding project that has raised more than $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors of the paper argue that the money that has been put into the project, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, could be frozen or stolen by attackers as a result of flaws in the way that the venture, known as the D.A.O., was set up. The money is all in a digital currency called Ether, which is a newer alternative to Bitcoin and exists entirely online.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threats emerged on the eve of the organization's move from fund-raising to operational mode, in which it will evaluate proposals to fund experimental digital projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.A.O. is a sort of venture capital fund that will pick investments based on direct voting from investors. The entire operation is computerized, with no humans in charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors of the new paper are calling for the D.A.O.'s investors to hold off on considering any potential investments until the vulnerabilities are fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current implementation can enable attacks with severe consequences,'' according to the paper, written by the computer scientists Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir and Emin Gün Sirer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University, has particular authority in the area because he previously was an author of a paper pointing out a serious vulnerability in the structure of Bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gün Sirer said in an email on Friday that his team had decided to release the paper on the D.A.O. this week so that investors ''will not be subject to attacks when the fund-raising deadline is over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gün Sirer said he sent the paper to the programmers who wrote the code underlying the D.A.O., and to some of the so-called curators on the project, who will help guide decisions in the venture. Christoph Jentzsch, who wrote the basic code, could not be reached for comment via email on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zamfir, one of Mr. Gün Sirer's co-authors, is one of the 10 curators. Another curator, Alex Van de Sande, a programmer in Brazil, said on Friday that the authors ''really raise some interesting attack vectors.'' He said he did not see the attacks as an imminent threat, but he was hoping that investors would vote to make the structure of the D.A.O. more secure, potentially by dividing it into several smaller funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.A.O. is built on <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span>, a newer cryptocurrency network that was created to overcome some shortcomings in Bitcoin.The <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> system enables so-called smart contracts in which legal agreements can be written into computer code. It is those smart contracts that serve as the basis for decision making and investments within the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The D.A.O. is motivated in large part by a broader desire to find more decentralized ways to make decisions and financial transactions, with fewer middlemen involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the organization began raising funds from investors in April, the surprising level of interest led investors to buy Ether -- the virtual currency in the <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> network -- to invest in the D.A.O. That drove up the price of Ether, which in turn drove up the value of Ether invested in the organization. As of last weekend, the aggregate value of Ether that had been sent to the venture by investors around the world was more than $150 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, several experts in the area have voiced concerns about the D.A.O., which has helped push down the price of Ether. On Friday, the value of the Ether in the D.A.O. was $131 million, even as the number of Ether invested had increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new paper points to several ways that bad actors could exploit the voting process that investors in the D.A.O. will use to choose investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At a fundamental level, these attacks all stem from unintended consequences of the mechanisms built into the D.A.O.'' the paper says. ''These problems can give rise to complex strategic behaviors, all resulting in a corruption of the intended, honest debate and voting process to select the most deserving proposals.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said that sales, which totaled $2 million in its first full year in 2011, surged to $76 million in 2015. Mr. Rudzin is projecting sales of $180 million this year and at least $275 million in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saatva has added two other lines of mattresses, foam and latex, and offers three firmness levels. The company had gained enough visibility to be asked to donate a mattress for Pope Francis during his visit to a Philadelphia seminary in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saatva's financing route stands in contrast from its biggest online competitor, Casper. That company went the more typical start-up route, with backing from prominent venture capitalists and even actors, such as Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who buck the odds by ''bootstrapping'' their own enterprises are rare, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a huge anomaly,'' said Mark Walsh, head of innovation and investment at the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>. He estimated that as few as one in 50 brick-and-mortar companies and one in 10 online companies could build their businesses into $50 million or $100 million enterprises on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But taking venture capital can be risky. In their haste to get financing, start-up founders often fail to read the fine print and later discover that they have signed away huge shares of the profits. In some cases, founders may be removed by the board of their own companies by the time the businesses are rapidly growing or plan to go public. For these reasons, some founders opt to take debt capital from banks and investors instead of giving away equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Spokeo</span>, an online people search engine, has been able to generate tens of millions in sales without venture backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't need it,'' said Harrison Tang, a founder of <span class="companylink">Spokeo</span>. But Mr. Tang, 34, did not always feel that way. When he created <span class="companylink">Spokeo</span> with three college buddies from <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span> in 2006, he tried to get equity financing, but was turned down by more than six angel and venture capital investors. Even his father, an entrepreneur himself, told his son he never expected to get the money he lent him back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's how much confidence people had in us,'' Mr. Tang said, laughing. But he -- and his three other founders -- Ray Chen, Mike Daly, and Eric Liang -- pressed on by borrowing $300,000 from parents and other family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, <span class="companylink">Spokeo</span> was a free program that aggregated information about people from social network sites, like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Friendster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the founders ran short of cash in 2008, they revamped the site, turning it into a people search program that gathers data based on names, phone numbers and email addresses, and started charging a subscription fee. The company said that its revenue surged to $78.5 million in 2015 from $11 million in 2011. Mr. Tang expects revenue to easily exceed $100 million by 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tang said he was proud that all four founders remain with the company, which might not have been the case if equity investors had been involved. ''We have been winning,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Ehrlich also self-financed his business school idea into a multimillion-dollar company. In 2004, Mr. Ehrlich came up with the idea for a grass-fed, organic beef importing business, Verde Farms, while visiting the grasslands of Argentina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, he wrote a business plan around importing such beef from Uruguay, New Zealand and Australia for his M.B.A. thesis at <span class="companylink">Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business</span> in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though very popular now, organic food was a concept met with much skepticism at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My professor hated it, and my classmates thought it was a terrible idea,'' he said. Even his parents wondered why a man with degrees from the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>'s Management and Technology program and an M.B.A. from Dartmouth would want to start a meat company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People thought that it was only tree-huggers who were into organic, and tree-huggers were vegetarians, not meat eaters,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Ehrlich tried to find angel investors, but refused to accept the terms. ''They wanted between 10 percent and 20 percent equity for a six-month loan,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he used $100,000 from savings and student loans to secure debt financing. It was a tough slog in those early years, and Mr. Ehrlich nearly decided to shut down in 2008. But everything changed in early 2009, when he signed on two national retailers, Wegmans and <span class="companylink">Costco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which is based in Woburn, Mass., said it sold 10.1 million pounds of grass-fed beef in 2015, up from 240,000 pounds in 2008. Sales, which totaled $665,000 in 2008, surged to $7 million in 2009 and more than $50 million in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equity investors are now coming to him, and he's the one turning them down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Verde -- like Saatva and <span class="companylink">Spokeo</span> -- does not rule out taking venture capital money in the future. But these founders say it would be for strategic rather than financial reasons to bring on venture capital expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most V.C.s are former entrepreneurs themselves,'' said Ben Veghte, a vice president at the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>. ''And they've been in the trenches and understand what it takes to build something from nothing and to build a successful company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for businesses with plans to go public, the guidance of a venture capitalist may be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh of the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> said it was rare that a company went public without at least some outside equity holders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't remember seeing a company going public on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> in the last 20 years who arrived at the I.P.O. with only management owning the company,'' he said. ''It's almost a rite of passage.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing her job at <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span>, the online deal company that went nearly bankrupt three years ago, Kate Levenstien decided to take a chance on a business that combined two things she loved: bacon and beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her plan was to hold an event celebrating the two in a baseball stadium. So she called ballparks in major cities, and the first one to agree was Safeco Field in Seattle, a city she had never visited. Without hesitation, she put down a deposit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She started selling tickets online just as she had helped other people sell their events on <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span>. And in May 2014, 6,000 people in Seattle paid about $60 each to eat bacon-themed morsels and sample beers until their arteries cried uncle. Two months later, 8,000 New Yorkers did the same thing at Citi Field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus was born the Bacon and Beer Classic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While successful entrepreneurs have plenty of stories about the early risks they took, Ms. Levenstien said she learned something from that first event that helped her build her business and put her on the path to personal wealth: the security of getting money in the door months before people attend an event and using those proceeds to finance the company's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no secret that banks are hesitant to lend to small business owners with unproven ideas, and when banks do lend, they are usually pretty conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the business owner wants to establish that second practice, but there isn't enough cash flow coming from the first location to finance that build-out, we'll say not now,'' said Noreen Bishop, senior vice president and regional executive for Chase Business Banking. ''If the second location will put that business owner and the first location at risk, we'll say let's give it one more year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that may be sound advice. The stories that get told about entrepreneurs who struggled but eventually succeeded are full of survivor bias. The stories of those who failed -- unless they are on the scale of a tech bust like <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span>, which was once valued as high as $4.5 billion but today is worth little -- do not get discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For entrepreneurs who are not in hot sectors like technology, growing their businesses and putting themselves on the path to wealth will have a lot more to do with their tolerance for risk and how they think about cash flow and partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The things that you noticed about people who succeed was that many of them were not great innovators,'' said Scott Winget, senior managing director of the Center for Wealth Impact at Ascent Private Capital Management, which often works with business owners after they've been successful. ''They have a degree of optimism, problem solving skills, but mostly, it's sheer doggedness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Levenstien's early success was funded by cash flow -- she has produced 15 bacon and beer events, as well as beer-themed events at several zoos and lower-key events like river tubing in Indiana -- she is thinking about her next options. One has been searching for partners, like the stadiums where the <span class="companylink">San Francisco 49ers</span> and the <span class="companylink">Denver Broncos</span> play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a lot of work and a lot of risk to go to another city,'' she said. ''So new venues have joined us as partners. They guide us on what we do. It made us a much more seamless event so we're don't say, 'We didn't sell tickets and now we're on the hook for $70,000.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jimmy Bernstein, the chief executive of Howl at the Moon, a chain of live-music bars, said he opened the first 10 locations using cash flow but the cost of each one slowed how fast he could grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a decade ago, he brought in investors who have allowed him to focus on running the business, while supplying him with the capital to open new locations. He credited that partnership with helping him to continue building his business when a Seattle location failed in 2006, costing him $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They said, 'Fail fast and move on,' '' he said. ''I set my sights on the next project, which was very exciting. It all came back to where it was before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet partners can only go so far. Jim McCann, founder and executive chairman of 1-800-Flowers, bought his first flower shop on First Avenue in Manhattan 40 years ago. And then, for 10 years, he said, he opened a new flower shop every six months, giving the store managers an ownership stake in each one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, in the middle of the boom in internet initial public offerings, he said executives at <span class="companylink">AOL</span> mentioned to him that he could grow more quickly if he took his company public. In late 1999, the company did just that, right before the markets began to cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got public on a multibillion-dollar valuation,'' Mr. McCann said. ''I remember sitting at a big sidewalk cafe on Third Avenue and saying to my brother Chris, 'Can you believe we've raised this money to meet all our capital needs for the next five years?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most entrepreneurs, taking their company public is a dream that will remain just that. More realistic types of financing are likely to come as bank loans or lines of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it's just a working capital line, we'd make a recommendation for what they would need to support that business over a 30- to 45-day period,'' Ms. Bishop said. ''If it's equipment, we could finance up to 100 percent of that equipment. If it's a building that we're purchasing, generally it's 80 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lines of credit can be helpful tools for cash flow, but they are generally not an option until a business has been running for several years. And even then, they are going to be limited in size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If your business is doing $100,000 revenue, a $100,000 line of credit is not realistic,'' said Robert Schapira, the Southwest small business leader at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. ''Ten to 20 percent of your revenue is the most a business should expect to healthily do this and to pay the line off consistently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the criteria banks place on making loans often force entrepreneurs bent on creating something quickly to look elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an earlier stage in his company, Gregory Zamfotis sought equity investments from family members for his first six Gregorys Coffee locations, which he opened from 2006 to 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt that the banks we had spoken to at the time were not willing to give us the amount of money to really change our lives, and the loan covenants that would come along with that money did not seem that appealing,'' he said. ''They might have been willing to give us $1 million, but that was two and a half stores to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in 2014, he partnered with Hexagon Hospitality, a venture firm specializing in restaurants, to get financial backing and opened his 17th Gregorys Coffee shop in Brooklyn Heights on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hexagon ''was more aggressive in their ability to provide financing and more capable of financing at a faster rate,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Levenstien said that she had been holding off on seeking outside financing, preferring to test out new concepts on her own. This summer, she will run a private Bacon and Beer Classic event at the Republican National Convention and start a new whiskey and fried food festival in Brooklyn in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is also planning a new festival this fall called Ramen Festival, which pairs beer and saki with ramen noodles. ''We're bringing in these sumo wrestlers who are awesome -- these 400-pound guys who are just picking each other up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is the entrepreneur's spirit, which may just lead to great wealth down the line.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -- Many tech start-ups are in the business of making themselves successful. But some entrepreneurs have set up businesses with the express mission of training others to be successful in the tech sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of those start-ups have dedicated themselves to creating programs, incubators or accelerators to train blacks and Hispanics for tech jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their efforts are coming at a time when Silicon Valley has increasingly been scrutinized for its lack of diversity. But instead of leaving it to the tech giants to solve the problem alone, some see their own connections as a way to address the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From NewME in California to Blue1647 in Illinois, entrepreneurs are cultivating talent within the groups that have been underrepresented at established tech companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey shows that there are more black and Hispanic students graduating with computer science degrees than there are working at tech jobs, despite campus recruitment efforts from companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founders of these start-ups say tech companies have to try new ways of seeking out talent. With the guiding hand of these programs, many alumni have gone on to secure tech internships and jobs or form their own start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angela Benton, founder of NewME, an accelerator for entrepreneurs of different backgrounds, said she faced skepticism about whether her business model was possible. Instead, Silicon Valley influencers encouraged her to scour elite institutions to find minority entrepreneurs to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I spent almost a year in Silicon Valley meeting with people, getting advice on our business model. They all wanted me to play it safe,'' said Ms. Benton, who was a teenage mother and went from graphic design to helping start B20, a black tech innovators site, in 2007. ''I don't come from that background.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Benton said she discovered that some of the most talented entrepreneurs weren't aiming to create the next billion-dollar start-up. Rather, the entrepreneurs of color were content to begin a company worth a few million dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over five years, the NewME accelerator has helped businesses raise more than $20 million in venture capital funding. It offers one-week programs and has more than 20,000 members so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many established accelerators and start-up incubators tend to be in regions and cities dominated by existing tech or business firms. For the new entrepreneurs, a key to success is setting up in underserved areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emile Cambry Jr., the founder of the nonprofit tech incubator Blue1647, chose to open its first location in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood, a primarily Hispanic neighborhood southwest of the city's bustling downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classes are not for dabblers. The company developed its curriculum to train students in Java, Ruby and other computer languages. It also provides a shared work space for entrepreneurs and connects students with internships, jobs and networking opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its founding in 2013, the nonprofit has expanded to Chicago's Roseland neighborhood, as well as St. Louis and Compton, Calif. A low-income area of Austin, Tex., is next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some alumni have interned at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Answers.com and other tech companies, while others have started their own businesses or landed tech jobs, Mr. Cambry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization has trained more than 2,400 youths and adults in its sequential classes or 12-week boot camps, the majority of whom identify as black or Hispanic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with tech backing, many of these ventures initially faced hurdles, like raising money or finding the best way to publicize community outreach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth Watkins, chief strategy officer at Blue1647, said he noticed that the Hispanic girls shone the most at the group's internship accelerator programs, but there weren't enough organizations catering to their specific needs, like bilingual skills. So in 2014, he started Latina Girls Code, which also offers training in 3-D printing and creating wearable tech. The program has only trained 83 Latinas, most of whom are third-generation, in HTML, <span class="companylink">CSS</span>, Javascript and other programming languages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But working with overlooked communities comes with unexpected challenges. For example, Mr. Watkins noticed that Chicago workshop locations discouraged some students and their families from participating because some feared being targeted by immigration officials or the police while traveling to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We now have to do an Aurora thing and a Joliet thing -- we have to do two different events, because they just can't travel but so far,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To expand, the founders of such ventures realize that collaborating with investors and tech companies like <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, Apple and <span class="companylink">Google</span> brings in more resources for their programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing so takes networking in tech circles and reaching out to companies who aim to diversify their staff and directly asking for their support, Mr. Watkins said. For him, it meant going to meet-ups and emphasizing to tech giants that supporting his organization could help close the diversity gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people like what you do until you start asking for money. Then it becomes quiet,'' Mr. Watkins said. ''You really have to have people in those positions who can really be advocates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to supporting NewME, <span class="companylink">Google</span> has worked with ventures like Code2040 and Manos Accelerator through Google for Entrepreneurs, which financially supports community start-up programs. That initiative is separate from its diversity team, Roya Soleimani, a Google spokeswoman, said in an email, adding that the company had increased the number of universities from which it recruits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the company continued to search for ''people who can bring new perspectives and life experiences to our teams.'' She pointed to a <span class="companylink">Google</span> blog post from June 1, 2015, reporting that 2 percent of <span class="companylink">Google</span> employees were black and 3 percent were Hispanic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most successful graduates of the start-ups would never have considered careers in technology. Nehemiah Bishop, a Chicago South Side native who earned his accounting degree at the <span class="companylink">University of Illinois-Chicago</span>, ''slept in hotels and lived in vans at one point'' in his life, but he received help from his brother and others to finish college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An accounting internship made him realize that it wasn't the field he wanted to pursue. He enrolled in Blue1647's HTML, <span class="companylink">CSS</span> and JavaScript class and a Ruby on Rails class, which helped him land a <span class="companylink">Google</span> internship. He was hired as an industrial engineer at UPS in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At Blue1647, when you come in to take a basic coding class, to get help with a start-up or to just come in for help with your homework, you come in to a family environment,'' Mr. Bishop said. The incubator provides ''that extra help of guidance from individuals that look like you, individuals that care for you as much as your parents care for you and who believe in you without a doubt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these ventures say that to really make a difference, more collaborations with established tech companies are necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dominic Liddell, founder of Tech While Black, a Chicago nonprofit organization that provides job and networking opportunities for black designers and developers, said he still faced an uphill battle in reaching out. The group has secured <span class="companylink">GitHub</span>, Code Climate and other software companies for sponsors, but he has hired a business development manager to build more relationships. The nonprofit was founded in 2014 and has helped more than 1,300 members through workshops and meet-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's enough out there for everybody to eat,'' Mr. Liddell said.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the United States Chamber of Commerce was among a number of groups that sued Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez to block a new fiduciary rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fiduciary rule requires money managers who advise tax-advantaged plans like 401(k)'s to put client interests ahead of their own financial interests when recommending investment products. The <span class="companylink">White House Council of Economic Advisers</span> estimates that as a result of this conflict of interest, workers saving for retirement lose $17 billion a year, much of which flows directly into Wall Street's coffers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a component of its campaign against the rule, the chamber created a webpage featuring 25 small-business leaders and others ''speaking out'' against the rule. Nearly all argued that the new rule would harm small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We tried to contact each of the featured small-business leaders. <span class="companylink">Public Citizen</span> is now publishing a report, ''Sacrificing the Pawns,'' revealing our findings. Highlights include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; One Chicago nonprofit leader did not realize he was listed on the webpage as opposing it and asked us, ''Who do I call to get this down?'' He said he did not have a view on the rule. He subsequently called the chamber and his name was removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; One small-business owner argued for an even tougher rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; One California small-business owner, who argued on the chamber's webpage that the current system helped her increase employment at her business over the last 12 years, acknowledged that she had only one employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Eight people were not small-business owners but were officials at chambers of commerce, paid lobbyists or other officials. We presume their testimonials were added to the chamber's webpage to pad the numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In brief, we found the chamber's portrayal of these small-business leaders' opposition to the fiduciary rule to be misleading and in some cases downright false. Far from a groundswell of grass-roots organizing, the chamber's list appears to be the product of an AstroTurf campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Featuring small businesses as the public face of its lobbying is central to the chamber's communications strategy on many issues. The chamber frequently uses small businesses and nonprofits to argue against rules that do not affect them or, as in the case of the fiduciary rule, are explicitly designed to protect them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of the chamber, Thomas Donohue, has acknowledged his strategy of using small-business owners as ''foot soldiers'' to provide ''political cover, for issues big companies want pursued.'' As in chess, he is sacrificing the pawns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its lawsuit against the fiduciary rule, the chamber cites harms to small businesses. We hope that by exposing the chamber's charade, courts reviewing the rule will understand that the alleged costs to small business are the imaginings of Washington's largest and most powerful lobby.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sizing up the honesty of small-business owners is one of the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>'s most vexing problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency estimates that it collects $458 billion a year less in taxes from all Americans than the government is actually due. Most of that ''tax gap'' is income that goes unreported, and the biggest chunk of it, by far -- $125 billion -- is individual business income.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers in this category, primarily sole proprietors, pay taxes on the money their operations make through their personal returns. Thus, their cash flows can be particularly opaque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take owners like Rebeca Mojica, a chainmaille jewelry designer in West Hollywood, Calif., who was audited in 2011. Her sales fluctuate significantly from year to year, and she takes some payments in cash. Were she so inclined, she could easily hide a chunk of that income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dreaded audit is the main way the I.R.S. catches scofflaws and ferrets out unreported income, but it is a time-consuming and imperfect tool. Short on resources, the agency collected just $7.3 billion from audits last year, its lowest total in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the I.R.S. really wants is for business owners to voluntarily pay more of what they owe. But 63 percent of ''low visibility'' income, the kind that isn't captured by outside parties on tax information documents, is not disclosed on tax forms, the agency says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for the last four years, the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office within the I.R.S., has been running studies to help it figure out how more small-business owners who pay their taxes can be persuaded to report their earnings more accurately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One finding suggests that audits, the agency's most powerful compliance tool, seem to have little lasting deterrent effect on tax cheats, and could even backfire for honest taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That discovery, and others, could help inform the agency's future collection techniques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, those suspected of tax dodging tend to cluster in certain geographic areas. The agency mapped out 365 communities with notably low tax-compliance rates among sole proprietors. Many were based in the South and West. California alone makes up a full third of the list; Georgia and Texas were also heavily represented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The researchers tried to compile a similar data-set of high-compliance places where business owners are likely to report their earnings accurately, but it found only three. Those in Mott Haven, a neighborhood in the South Bronx; West Somerville, Mass.; and Portersville, Ind., appear to be unusually law-abiding.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is behind the clusters? Community norms play a major role, the tax researchers theorized. Business owners who were less compliant in paying their taxes were more likely to be active in civic groups and religious congregations, and they ''appear to exhibit a stronger association with local institutions than national ones such as the federal government.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, if people at your neighborhood potlucks or trade group meetings take a dim view of Washington, you might be more inclined to do some fudging at tax time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another surprise was the effectiveness of audits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-employed individuals who went through an audit and were found to be clean reported less income in subsequent years, a different study found. The drop wasn't small: Three years after their audits, the study's test group of taxpayers reported 35 percent less in taxable income than a control group of similar taxpayers who had not been audited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers could only guess at a cause. The audit may have been a discouraging experience and sapped the subject's ''tax morale.'' Or perhaps it inadvertently offered insight into previously unknown tactics for both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most audits are not random. The I.R.S. has a secret algorithm that it uses to calculate how likely each taxpayer is to have unreported income. Those with high scores are more likely to be audited -- and once the auditors start digging, they usually find things. Of the 1.2 million individual returns that the agency audited (including sole proprietorships) in 2014, only 13 percent emerged without any tax adjustments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who dodge their taxes and get caught, the sting seems to fade fast. In the years right after an audit, taxpayers who had to make additional payments appeared to become a bit more compliant, but the effect diminished over time and disappeared entirely by Year 5, another study found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any initial impact of the audit on compliance is short-lived,'' the researchers concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't surprise Fred Daily, a Florida tax lawyer who specializes in audits and tax crimes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had people who got caught by the I.R.S. and got serious damage -- hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage -- and at first, they're like people just out of jail: 'I'm never going back again!' A few years later, they're right back to doing what they had done before,'' he said. ''People's character doesn't change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Daily says that only a minority of those he encounters actively intend to cheat. Many people, especially business owners, run into problems in an audit simply because they kept bad records or did not understand all of their tax obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so easy to call yourself a sole proprietor; just put up a website or print a business card,'' he said. ''They don't realize all the requirements, like quarterly estimated reporting and the self-employment tax. The tax laws are impenetrable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even for law-abiding owners, an audit is unnerving and time-consuming. Ms. Mojica, the jewelry designer, estimates that she spent $500 in accounting fees and 15 hours of her and her staff's time dealing with her 2011 audit. The process lasted seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, she owed nothing -- which provided an unanticipated psychological boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had this feeling of, 'Yay! I'm doing all right!''' Ms. Mojica said. ''I also felt motivated to keep even better records. I spent an hour or two trying to find information on a very small number of transactions, and I could have been spared that if we'd kept a better paper trail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for business owners is that audits are extremely rare. Around 1.5 percent of self-employed taxpayers are audited each year, the agency says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, businesses should always brace for the possibility of an audit. ''Document everything'' is the advice Vanessa Kruze, an accountant who focuses on start-ups, gives her clients. Expense reports draw particular scrutiny from auditors, and using a program like <span class="companylink">Expensify</span> to track receipts makes it much simpler to back up claims, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Daily, who has been steering clients through audits for 35 years, said the biggest surprise to him is how rarely the I.R.S. checks back on the worst offenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's budget cuts have taken a noticeable toll, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really counterintuitive how they do not stay on some of these people and audit them year after year,'' Mr. Daily said. ''I've had people where, as we finish an audit, I've said, 'This very likely isn't the last time you will see the I.R.S.' -- and actually, it is.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hacker on Friday siphoned more than $50 million of digital money away from an experimental virtual currency project that had been billed as the most successful crowdfunding venture ever -- taking with him not just a third of the venture's money but also the hopes and dreams of thousands of participants who wanted to prove the safety and security of digital currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attack most likely puts an end to the project, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which had raised $160 million in the form of Ether, an alternative to the digital currency Bitcoin. While the computer scientists involved in the project are aiming to tweak the code that underpins Ether in a way that will recover the money, the theft is nevertheless prompting a bigger debate about the viability and principles of virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ether.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of the nightmare scenarios everyone was worried about: Someone exploited a weakness in the code of the D.A.O. to empty out a large sum,'' Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell who co-wrote a paper pointing out problems with the project, said on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks and financial firms have been exploring how to use the technology underlying virtual currencies -- known as blockchain -- to improve their own internal systems. The technology is considered to have advantages in terms of transparency and security. Just last week, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told central bankers at a trade industry conference that they should accelerate their efforts to explore blockchain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the incident on Friday provided another reminder of how the code can be just as vulnerable to human greed and mistakes as paper bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.A.O. was meant to be a standard-bearer for online currency ventures. It was funded by investors from around the world using Ether, which has become popular over the last year. But just before the project stopped raising money in late May, computer scientists pointed out several vulnerabilities in its underlying code -- effectively warning that what happened to the experimental consortium would be possible or even likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The D.A.O. is being attacked,'' Griff Green, a community organizer with the company that wrote the project's software, Slock.it, wrote on a chat channel for the project Friday morning. ''This is not a drill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money that the hacker moved appeared to be frozen on Friday as a result of a safeguard previously built into the code. The thief was caught in what might be thought of as a digital version of the airtight double doors that sometimes protect valuable sites (known in security circles as man traps).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Programmers working on the <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> network, which hosts Ether, were debating on Friday whether to make a one-time change to the code to recover the frozen money. That faced immediate opposition from many virtual currency purists who were attracted to the technology because of its ostensible freedom from human meddling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The strength of blockchain tech is that it is a ledger, a statement of truth,'' Bruce Fenton, a board member with the <span class="companylink">Bitcoin Foundation</span>, wrote on Friday. ''That ledger is only as good as its resistance to censorship, change, demands or attack.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the leaders of the <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> project decide to move forward with a change to the code -- known as a fork -- they will need to win the support of the people who lend their computing power to the network, and who have what amounts to a vote over any changes to the <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hacking on Friday underscored the complicated governance structure employed by so-called cryptocurrencies. These currencies are not run by any company or individual but by the computers of anyone who chooses to support the network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The D.A.O. was supposed to be a further extension of this concept of group decision-making. Thousands of people around the world financed the project by sending in Ether. The D.A.O. was supposed to act as a sort of venture capital fund, investing in projects that were voted upon by people who contributed money. The attack on Friday took place before any projects had been funded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The specific mechanism the hackers used is known as a recursive call vulnerability, -- essentially a malicious transaction that moves money away from the D.A.O. into a side fund in an endlessly repeating loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attack led to chaos on the online message boards where D.A.O. investors and Ether users gather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How can we help and protect our funds?'' one user wrote on the Slack chat channel for D.A.O. investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programmers who wrote the D.A.O. code immediately suggested that investors vote to move their money to another, unrelated project known as Congo Split, primarily to protect their investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The community needs to spam the network so that it can mount a counterattack,'' Stephan Tual, an employee with Slock.it, wrote on that company's website. Programmers with Slock.it wrote the code for the D.A.O. but said they had no formal continuing role with the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time it was over, the hacker had managed to gain control of 3.6 million Ether -- more than a third of the 11.5 million that were there at the beginning of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The D.A.O.'s journey is over,'' Mr. Tual said in an email on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident on Friday was a reminder of the dozens of hacking attacks and thefts that have rattled Bitcoin since it was released in early 2009. In 2014, <span class="companylink">Mt. Gox</span>, which was previously the largest Bitcoin exchange, announced that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attacks on Bitcoin have generally led to a temporary lull in public interest in virtual currencies. But Bitcoin has bounced back each time. Over the last week, the price of Bitcoin has risen swiftly to the highest level since the <span class="companylink">Mt. Gox</span> fiasco; it stood at $770 on Thursday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the recent demand for Bitcoin has come from anticipation of a coming event known as halving. Currently, the Bitcoin software releases 25 new coins -- a block -- every 10 minutes or so to computers helping support the network. In mid-July, the blocks will shrink to 12.5 coins. The shrinking supply has led some to assume that the price will go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of Ether had been rising alongside Bitcoin over the last month, in part because of the interest generated by the D.A.O. On Thursday, both were up more than 60 percent over the previous month. But the attack Friday morning sent the price of Ether into a downward spiral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday afternoon, the price of Ether had fallen 33 percent from its high a day earlier, to around $13. Bitcoin had also fallen, though less sharply, to around $750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founder and lead programmer on the <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> project, Vitalik Buterin, wrote on Friday that he supported a change to the code that would reclaim the money from the hacker. But he said he recognized that he might not win the argument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I recognize that there are very heavy arguments on both sides, and that either direction would have seen very heavy opposition,'' Mr. Buterin wrote on Reddit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor, wrote: ''There is no good solution here.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW DELHI -- The governor of <span class="companylink">India's central bank</span>, Raghuram G. Rajan, announced on Saturday that he would step down in September and return to academia, ending a three-year tenure that enhanced India's standing in international markets but frustrated conservatives and small business owners eager for deep interest rate cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rajan previously expressed interest in staying on for a second term, but he said in a letter to colleagues that he had reconsidered. The decision, his letter implied, was driven in part by the preferences of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While I was open to seeing these developments through, on due reflection, and after consultation with the government, I want to share with you that I will be returning to academia when my term as governor ends on Sept. 4, 2016,'' the letter read.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will, of course, always be available to serve my country when needed,'' the letter added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, predicted the 2008 global financial crisis three years before it happened, to an incredulous audience of prominent bankers and economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He took over the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span> in 2013. At the time, India's economy was considered one of the ''fragile five'' emerging markets, and the rupee was in free fall. The technocratic Mr. Rajan was credited with reining in double-digit inflation and winning back the confidence of international investors. Indian journalists called him a ''rock star economist'' and, in a reference to India's benchmark index, said he had ''put the sex back in Sensex.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though India's growth has been strong by international standards, many of those who backed Mr. Modi have expressed frustration that Mr. Rajan did not do more to stimulate growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rajan's critics, led by the parliamentarian Subramanian Swamy of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, complained that he had focused too much on reducing inflation and had not acted to ease the heavy debt burdens of many Indian companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swamy, a former commerce minister and law minister, was jubilant on Saturday, saying a change in leadership would probably lead to swifter economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I certainly wanted him out, and I made it clear to the prime minister, as clear as possible,'' he said, adding that he expected a positive reaction from India's industrialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His audience was essentially Western, and his audience in India was transplanted westernized society,'' he said. ''People used to come in delegations to my house to urge me to do something about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public attacks on Mr. Rajan, analysts said, coincided with a growing conviction among Mr. Modi's inner circle that with inflation under control, the time was ripe to loosen monetary policy and publicly celebrate India's robust growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rajan was not inclined to do so. In interviews, he continued to urge the government to undertake structural reforms to the banking industry and to warn against complacency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, when Mr. Rajan was asked to comment on India's new status as a ''bright spot'' in the global economy, his response was notably sober.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have this saying, 'In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,''' he said. Shortly afterward, one of Mr. Modi's top lieutenants rebuked Mr. Rajan for offending the visually impaired, and Mr. Rajan publicly apologized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also raised hackles by warning in a speech against ''anyone imposing a particular view or ideology because of their power,'' a remark that was viewed as stepping outside his area of expertise and into the realm of politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They wanted him to be the purveyor of good news, rather than a sense of realism, and that did not go down well at all,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. ''Now that there is a sense the economy has turned a corner, the view that he was dispensable had come to take hold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rajan is the first central bank governor since 1992 to opt not to seek a second term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The finance minister, Arun Jaitley, has said an announcement on a successor will come ''shortly.'' Markets were expected to open lower on Monday on the news, as investors wait to see who will replace Mr. Rajan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC Bank, called it ''a sad day for all of us.'' He said he expected to spend Monday responding to calls from upset investors, but said, ''We'll have to convince them that the macroeconomic factors are extremely strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this had happened when India was weak, it would be chaotic, it would be terrible, it would be catastrophe,'' he said. ''I think we can take it at this time. The hit will be minimal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those who expressed regret at Mr. Rajan's decision was Palaniappan Chidambaram, a senior leader of the opposition Congress Party, who said he was ''disappointed and profoundly saddened,'' but not surprised, by the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The government had invited this development through a craftily planned campaign of insinuations, baseless allegations and puerile attacks on a distinguished academic and economist,'' he said. ''This government did not deserve Mr. Rajan.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillary Clinton's technology policy initiative, released on Tuesday, is a list maker's dream, a parade of specific proposals covering a spectrum of issues. But its overriding theme is that technology should be an engine of equality rather than elitism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal, the summary document declares, is ''to create the jobs of the future on Main Street.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Clinton's agenda includes having the federal government step in to help fill a finance gap, as banks have cut their loans to small businesses and venture capital funding is concentrated in a few regions, led by Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her plan calls for ''supporting incubators, accelerators, mentoring and training for 50,000 entrepreneurs in underserved areas,'' and increasing funding for several existing programs that offer tax credits and financing for community development and small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a pragmatic plan that could help leverage what happens in Silicon Valley so that there's innovation and job growth throughout the country,'' said Karen Kornbluh, former United States ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, who is an adviser to the Clinton campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clinton program also links start-ups with the student loan crisis. Under her plan, young entrepreneurs could defer payments on their federal student loans for up to three years. The relief might also apply to the early employees of start-ups, like the first 10 or 20 workers, according to the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deferred payment plan, the campaign document states, could mean that ''millions of young Americans'' would not have to pay interest or principal on their loans ''as they work through the critical start-up phase of new enterprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is clearly a nod to young voters, who overwhelmingly supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clinton plan offers a liberal immigration initiative that has long been a favorite of technology executives and venture capitalists: automatically issuing permanent resident status to people who earn graduate degrees in science, engineering and mathematics from accredited universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clinton program also would dedicate additional funding and resources to Obama administration policies in areas like building broadband networks in rural areas, encouraging computer science education for elementary and high school students, and job training in technology fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics questioned spending to ''double down'' on programs that have not yet proved effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one seems to be evaluating these programs,'' said Thomas Lenard, president of the Technology Policy Institute, a nonprofit research foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Eisenach, a visiting scholar at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>, a right-leaning policy research group, said, ''This isn't a technology plan, it's a government spending plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other technology policy experts were impressed by the Clinton campaign document as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's got a technology and innovation agenda, and this suggests it would be a strong focus in a Clinton presidency,'' said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit policy research group. ''That in itself is a message.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- <span class="companylink">Zenefits</span> investors are getting a larger piece of the troubled human resources start-up because they overpaid for their stakes, unaware that the company's sales teams flouted regulations to enhance growth, <span class="companylink">Zenefits</span> announced on Thursday. The move will cut the company's valuation in half, to about $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unusual agreement comes after months of turmoil at <span class="companylink">Zenefits</span>, once a high-flying company that helps small businesses buy insurance. The company, based in San Francisco, failed to comply with health insurance regulations in some markets. Parker Conrad, co-founder and chief executive, stepped down in February after admitting that he created the software employees used to bypass insurance brokerage regulations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David O. Sacks, who replaced Mr. Conrad as chief executive, said in an email to employees that the decision stemmed from discussions with a number of the company's major investors, and that <span class="companylink">Fidelity</span>, TPG, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> and <span class="companylink">Insight Venture Partners</span> had all agreed to the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new terms, the stake owned by investors in the company's Series C funding round will increase to 25 percent, from 11 percent. That group invested about $500 million in May 2015. Earlier investors will soon be offered an opportunity to own more of the company to offset the dilution of their stakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At some point, this company will want to sell its shares again, and future prospective shareholders will look closely at how we treated our current shareholders,'' Mr. Sacks wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the last six months, in the face of very significant challenges, David Sacks has shown incredible leadership,'' said Bill McGlashan, the founder and managing partner of TPG Growth. ''He and the board have held the company accountable and done the right thing by customers, employees, regulators and investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Zenefits</span> was once a celebrated Silicon Valley start-up. The series C investors granted the company a $4 billion valuation largely because its revenue was growing so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it came to light that Mr. Conrad had created software, called the Macro, that allowed sales representatives to get around regulations, they maintained that they had overpaid for a piece of a company whose fast growth was built on false pretenses, according to two people with knowledge of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sacks, who has personally invested more than $12 million in <span class="companylink">Zenefits</span>, stepped into the role of chief executive shortly after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We self-reported the issue to regulators, brought our licensing into compliance, changed our leadership and governance, instituted new company values, and began to transform the culture,'' Mr. Sacks wrote in an email to employees on Thursday. ''In many ways this is a different company than the one they originally joined, but our employees have embraced our new values and our mission to make small-business ownership easier and more accessible to everyone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Zenefits</span> laid off 17 percent of its work force in February, and announced another round of layoffs in its Arizona office in mid-June. It is working on what it calls ''Z2,'' effectively a reboot of the company under new leadership and oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Z2'' is expected to start in October, the company has said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given how much <span class="companylink">Zenefits</span> has changed under Mr. Sacks's leadership, a few weeks ago employees were given the opportunity to take a voluntary two-month severance package. Mr. Sacks said in his email that 90 percent of the employees chose to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Common shareholders, including employees, will see about a 20 percent dilution in their stakes, ''about the same as a typical financing round,'' Mr. Sacks wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make sure their ownership stakes did not lose too much value, nonexecutive employees who stayed received a stock grant equal to 25 percent of their current number of shares.</p>

One day, however, he saw that his parents had started using an electric bike that his brother Yevgeniy had modified for his wife and himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Electric bikes are an equalizer,'' said Mr. Mordkovich, who has also owned a software company and a small-business magazine. ''They let the rider decide how much or how little they will pedal.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, he said, Evelo, the electric bike company that he founded with his brother, will double its revenue to $4 million, and it is profitable. ''There's no shortage of potential customers,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is just one of many that are plugging into a wealthy slice of the over-50 demographic called the longevity market, whose annual economic activity currently amounts to $7.6 trillion, according to AARP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an estimated 74.9 million baby boomers, according to <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span>, the biggest market opportunity for start-ups is older Americans rather than hip millennials. As members of the generation that defined rock 'n' roll grow older, they are adding a wide range of goods and services to their lifestyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The staggering size of the total longevity economy -- bigger even than Japan's -- has been attracting more entrepreneurs, deep-pocketed financiers and places to pitch new ideas in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every dissonance of age is a marketing opportunity,'' said Mary Furlong, a marketing and strategy consultant for the 50-plus market and author of ''Turning Silver Into Gold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New business ideas that cater to boomers are nearly endless, she said, and include chefs, online dating sites and yoga instructors for people with health issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's more talent coming into the market,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mordkovich brothers initially financed Evelo with $100,000 that came from selling their previous businesses. Now they are planning to raise $1.5 million from investors through Fundable, a crowdfunding site.Their objectives are to add more electric bikes, including one that folds; expand internationally; and offer more bike features, like theft protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of their biggest challenges was finding good manufacturing plants in Asia. ''We had come from e-commerce and virtual goods,'' Mr. Mordkovich said. With the help of referrals from the Light Electric Vehicle Association, they found factories in Taiwan and southern China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much-needed tools for the elderly, like the gunmetal gray walkers that date to the 1950s, badly need a makeover, experts added. But simply applying high-technology solutions to existing products does not always work, they cautioned. For instance, wearable devices have been popular with millennials for monitoring and tracking health, but they are not necessarily going to be a hit with older users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People lose interest in wearables very quickly,'' said Jody Holtzman, senior vice president for market innovation at AARP. ''They can see the potential, but design is problematic.'' According to AARP studies, he added, users had difficulty with syncing wearable products with their computers or even finding directions that explain how to use them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are no clear market leaders,'' said Lori Bitter, who heads The Business of Aging, a consulting firm based in Napa, Calif. ''And how do we get the technology into people's homes?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain services, though, are finding their target audience. They include companies that offer home downsizing, gyms for the 55-and-older set and meal kits for people with diabetes or heart conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's quite a lot of funding available, too,'' Mr. Holtzman said. ''A few years ago, when we showed up at a V.C. event, people wondered what we were doing there.'' That doesn't happen anymore, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, AARP holds yearly pitch events and even has its own incubator, The Hatchery. Entrepreneurs are also showing up at other events like the Silicon Valley Boomer Venture Summit, which Ms. Furlong produces, and those held by Aging 2.0, a San Francisco innovation accelerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At AARP's first health innovations pitch event in 2012, 80 companies applied, Mr. Holtzman said. This year's event in April, which focused on caregiving, had 200 applicants. This segment has already attracted many well-funded start-ups, like Honor, HomeHero and <span class="companylink">CareLinx</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a 2014 survey done for AARP, 34.2 million Americans served as unpaid caregivers to a loved one 50 years old or older in the previous 12 months. In a mobile society, though, fewer family members are available as caregivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are looking at how to finance longevity,'' Ms. Furlong said. ''And their first concern is the cost of health care.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An online ''family concierge'' service called Envoy is among those that have found backers to serve this area. The company, now four years old, has pulled in $4.2 million from notable early-stage investors like SoftTech VC, which financed Fitbit and <span class="companylink">Mint.com</span>, and Lowercase Capital, which has backed start-ups like Uber, <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> and Kickstarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Envoy sets itself apart by hiring stay-at-home mothers with flexible schedules. They do light chores, like walking a dog, washing dishes or grocery shopping. The service is now in 22 metropolitan areas with significant aging populations like Phoenix, Miami and Las Vegas. Justin Lin, who founded Envoy, eventually wants to expand to 100 areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My own mom passed away from cancer,'' said Mr. Lin, who has started three other businesses. ''My dad would need help soon. But there weren't a lot of caregiving options.'' That realization, he said, led to his starting Envoy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After testing Envoy with friends and family for a few years, he discovered that caregiving was a much-needed service. ''I was building a service that's potentially powerful,'' said Mr. Lin. The company is not yet profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many start-ups are trying new ways to reach their target audiences. Evelo, the bicycle company, uses a network of about 300 so-called brand ambassadors to market to potential customers. They have bought a bike, registered on the site to be ambassadors and can opt to take prospective buyers on test rides. After a bike purchase, the ambassador gets a $200 check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even businesses with decidedly mundane products are finding ways to capture the longevity niche. Foot care, for example, is a huge market, and ''finding shoes that are attractive and feel good is a huge deal,'' Ms. Bitter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the founders of the Rockport Company, Bruce R. Katz, reinvented himself in 2013 by starting the Samuel Hubbard Shoe Company to sell comfortable footwear to baby boomer men. He markets his collection as ''un-sneakers'' that have three-part insoles and are lightweight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As people get older, walking is one of the most important exercises,'' said Mr. Katz, a third-generation shoemaker. ''And there's more problems with the feet.'' To add the cool factor, a limited edition collection is available in sky blue, plum and lime green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which sells its footwear online and through retailers, now offers 18 styles of men's shoes and will soon begin offering women's shoes. It logged $2 million in revenue last year selling primarily to baby boomers. Mr. Katz expects sales to reach $12 million this year and estimates that the company will be profitable next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a validation of the brand's appeal to baby boomers, former President Bill Clinton, who turns 70 this month, was even photographed walking a dog, wearing Samuel Hubbard's sky blue shoes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span> as an independent company is near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under financial pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan -- and contending with the deep pockets of Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur who provided funding for the case and others against the organization -- Gawker filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put itself up for sale two months ago. At the time, the digital media company Ziff Davis submitted an opening bid of $90 million, essentially setting the floor for an auction on Tuesday. Final bids are due Monday at 5 p.m.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen to two dozen parties have expressed varying degrees of interest in <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>, and three to five companies have emerged as the most likely bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So who might buy it? Here are some possibilities:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ziff Davis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAKES SENSE Ziff Davis was the first company to publicly put a dollar figure on its interest in <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>, and its $90 million bid might be more than other companies are willing to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Ziff Davis, a once-mighty publisher of computer magazines, now has a portfolio of technology, gaming and men's lifestyle sites. ''The additions of Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Kotaku would fortify our position in consumer tech and gaming,'' Vivek Shah, the chief executive of Ziff Davis, wrote in an internal staff memo in June, referring to Gawker's media properties. Mr. Shah also said other properties -- Jalopnik, Deadspin and Jezebel -- ''would broaden our position as a lifestyle publisher.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ziff Davis, like other potential buyers, may be more interested in <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>'s e-commerce business, which the company has built over the last several years as it has looked beyond advertising for revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAY NOT WORK As a so-called stalking-horse bidder, any potential buyer would have to exceed Ziff's $90 million bid. But by submitting the first bid, Ziff Davis telegraphed what it was willing to pay, and it could be outbid in the auction if it does not think <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span> is worth much more. If Ziff Davis, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">j2 Global</span>, an internet services and publishing conglomerate, does end up the winner, <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span> would become part of a large public company. That could be good for Gawker if it is allowed to operate more or less on its own. But Gawker could end up being a small fish in a very large pond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Univision</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAKES SENSE <span class="companylink">Univision</span>, the Spanish-language media company, has made moves in recent months suggesting it is looking to build its online portfolio, particularly to reach a younger audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, <span class="companylink">Univision</span> acquired a large stake in The Onion, the comedy and satirical digital media company. And in April, it acquired full control of Fusion, a news site and cable channel that it started with the <span class="companylink">Walt Disney Company</span> in 2013. <span class="companylink">Univision</span> also owns other digital properties, including The Root, a site focused on African-American issues. <span class="companylink">Univision</span> and <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span> had been in discussions about a potential investment in the past, though those ended because of the Hogan trial, according to two people briefed on the talks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAY NOT WORK <span class="companylink">Univision</span> might not want to spend more money on digital investments right now. For <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>, becoming part of <span class="companylink">Univision</span> poses benefits and challenges similar to those of becoming part of Ziff Davis: It would be part of a large company, which would be good if it were left alone but bad if it were swallowed up and forgotten. <span class="companylink">Univision</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Magazine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAKES SENSE New York magazine most likely does not have enough cash on hand to buy <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span> by itself. But it is owned by the Wasserstein family trust, and Pamela Wasserstein is the chief executive of New York Media, the magazine's parent company. Bruce Wasserstein, who bought New York magazine for $55 million in 2004, was an investment banker and founder of the private equity firm <span class="companylink">Wasserstein &amp; Company</span>, which manages capital on behalf of the Wasserstein family and other investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York magazine, whose online brands include Vulture and The Cut, has also been on a digital push lately. It recently started Select All, a technology and culture site led by Max Read, a former editor of Gawker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAY NOT WORK It is not clear whether New York magazine will be able to muster up enough financial help, either from <span class="companylink">Wasserstein &amp; Company</span> or elsewhere, to secure a deal. Ms. Wasserstein declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Penske Media</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAKES SENSE <span class="companylink">Penske Media</span>, which owns brands including the Hollywood publications Deadline and Variety, could fit <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>'s sites into its portfolio. It has not shied away from buying down-on-their-luck media companies in the past: In 2014, it bought <span class="companylink">Fairchild Fashion Media</span>, whose publications included the fashion magazine Women's Wear Daily, from Condé Nast for about $100 million. And it bought Variety for $25 million in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAY NOT WORK Penske may not have the money (though it could team up with an investment firm or another company for help). <span class="companylink">Penske Media</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Vox Media</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAKES SENSE <span class="companylink">Vox Media</span> has a collection of sites -- including Vox.com, the sports site SB Nation and the technology site The Verge -- that could absorb <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>'s sites relatively easily.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHY IT MAY NOT WORK <span class="companylink">Vox Media</span> could offer <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span> a deal in the form of stock. But <span class="companylink">Vox Media</span> is not a public company, and valuing its stock is an inexact science. The other option would be to team up with another company or an investment firm that could supply cash for an acquisition. In any case, it is not clear what Gawker would bring to the company that it does not already have. A spokeswoman for Vox Media declined to comment.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When start-ups begin, it's akin to Joseph Campbell's mythical hero's journey. Instead of battling hydras and gorgons alone, entrepreneurs often help each other face obstacles like entrenched markets, financing and abject fear of failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a symbiotic relationship that makes sense to Shradha Agarwal and Rishi Shah, both 31 and co-founders of ContextMedia, a health care media company in Chicago. The two entrepreneurs are expanding their 10-year-old company, which they started when they were students at <span class="companylink">Northwestern University</span>. They have made a point of supporting other start-ups by financing an angel fund called Jumpstart Ventures. The fund has backed more than 45 businesses, giving $20 million since 2011.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there are no precise estimates on how many such ecosystems exist, the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span>, a research organization focusing on entrepreneurship, found that nearly every one of the more than 360 major metropolitan areas in the United States had such a network in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ContextMedia provides customized health care information on screens at doctors' offices and other sites. Doctors can show patients digital 3-D anatomical diagrams of procedures using ContextMedia ''wallboards'' or tablets. Their material is now viewed by more than six million patients a month at 25,000 medical practices or health care locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is also working with the <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span> to bring their media content directly to hospitals and physician offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 400 people work at the company, whose revenue last year was $63.5 million. It hopes to add more than 200 workers by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although ContextMedia has made inroads into a notoriously difficult market to crack -- doctors' waiting and examination rooms -- it was done without venture capitalists, who weren't willing to take a risk, Ms. Agarwal said. Support from the Chicago entrepreneurial community not only got her company started, but it also helped the company clear some high hurdles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professors at Northwestern first helped Mr. Shah and Ms. Agarwal. And the founders ''bootstrapped,'' or self-funded, their enterprise during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2008-2009, we slowed down,'' Ms. Agarwal said, ''so we had to reconnect to our journey, which was our passion for changing health care.'' With the Jumpstart fund, she says she now wants to ''pay it forward'' to other entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These support systems need to be diverse to be effective, though. According to the <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>, which surveyed more than a thousand entrepreneurs around the world, what start-ups value most are accessible markets, funding, regulatory framework, an educated work force and major universities. That doesn't mean, however, that the network always provides robust financial backing from big-money players like large venture capital firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ecosystem also offers social and psychological support. What fuels entrepreneurial success, Ms. Agarwal noted, are passion and purpose. When she started her company, she wanted an enterprise that would have a positive social and personal impact. She started with diabetes education, a disease that affected both her and Mr. Shah's relatives in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Agarwal interviews candidates for the Jumpstart Ventures portfolio, she wants to find like-minded people who are ''passionate about their mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mert Iseri, co-founder and chief executive of SwipeSense, a company focused on reducing hospital infections, was someone who fit the bill. Also a former Northwestern student, he met Ms. Agarwal in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iseri, 28, was focused on providing a digital hand hygiene solution to combat the 100,000 annual deaths in the United States from hospital-acquired infections. Such infections cost $28 billion a year in related health care expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Shradha became our first investor and gave us our first check for $25,000 and employed 'radical candor,''' in her mentoring, Mr. Iseri said. That included discussions about tough decisions that had to be made when building a business, such as hiring, firing and determining long-term goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is always difficult to fire someone,'' Mr. Iseri said. He described one situation where a sales representative was a high performer but didn't fit the culture at <span class="companylink">SwipeSense</span>. ''Shradha was very clear; her direct feedback was to part ways right then and there, and she highlighted that no amount of short-term results can justify holding on to folks who won't be long-term members of the team.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">SwipeSense</span>'s initial presentation at Healthbox, a Chicago-based incubator, raised $1 million in 2011 after one of its first demonstrations. Mr. Iseri credited Ms. Agarwal's continuing support with helping his company secure more than $12 million through several rounds of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iseri would not disclose his company's sales but said it had ''annual revenues in the seven figures'' and was ''experiencing significant month-over-month growth'' with its customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Agarwal, her employees, co-investors and angel investors have also bolstered entrepreneurs by simply being nearby and giving direct guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, ContextMedia provided office space to Packback, which offers online learning communities and digital textbooks for college students. Ms. Agarwal and ContextMedia employees often interacted with the firm's workers to offer advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been in seven office spaces since we were founded four years ago,'' said Jessica Tenuta, a co-founder and head of design of Packback. ''Shradha showed us how to hire and incorporate our values while mentoring us. We made great connections while being in their space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Packback now has 24 employees and a $250,000 investment from Mark Cuban, who took a 20 percent stake in the company after the co-founders presented on the reality show ''Shark Tank'' two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tenuta and Packback's co-founders -- Kasey Gandham, Nick Currier and Mike Shannon -- have also garnered support in other ways. The company works with 1871, a business incubator in Chicago that offers classes, co-working spaces and access to venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tenuta did not disclose her company's sales revenue but said the firm expects to have 30,000 students using Packback in the 2016-17 school year, up from 10,000 students in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their part, Mr. Iseri and Ms. Tenuta were inspired by their experiences to mentor other start-ups. These may be at university-based or private incubators and accelerators, in co-working environments or through other angel investors and venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Agarwal characterized the payoff as ''the communal support through learning, wellness and volunteer opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that her enterprise and those she backs have ''a bias toward action and scaling to the market.'' That means an entrepreneur's vision must eventually translate into revenues, profit, growth and a commitment to giving back to the community and other entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The network of support offered by start-up ecosystems, though, won't get entrepreneurs entirely past the fear of failure and rejection. A plunge into the unknown is part of making it past those perilous first years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I was a girl, my mother pushed me into the deep end of a pool to get me to swim,'' recalled Ms. Agarwal, who grew up in India. ''She said it was the only way to learn. She was one of four daughters in her family, all of whom were pushed to earn college degrees by my grandmother.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Ms. Agarwal and her peers succeed, their companies will also contribute to social good such as better medical education and improved health outcomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will, in her words, be ''solving problems worth solving.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department has moved a step closer to tightening the way family limited partnerships are valued for tax purposes. And the prospect that the tax code could be changed by the end of this year has tax planners pushing their clients to consider stepping up estate and business planning, or risk paying more taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the Treasury Department issued ''proposed final regulations'' to eliminate a provision in the tax code that effectively allows wealthy people to greatly discount the value of shares in a family limited partnership given to family members. These partnerships are able to own assets like family business, real estate and securities.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discount, which has been allowed since the 1990s, is granted for what is considered a lack of marketability for minority shares in these partnerships. If a family member, for example, wanted to sell his or her share in a partnership that was entirely owned by other family members, the pool of buyers might well be limited to his or her relatives. They might not have the money -- or desire -- to buy him out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This provision, contained in section 2704 of the Internal Revenue Code, has been abused by aggressive tax planners and lawyers who used the discount, sometimes as high as 40 percent, and applied it to partnerships that contained marketable securities or other assets that could otherwise be easily valued and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> has repeatedly balked at stocks and bonds being discounted just because they were owned in a family partnership. On Dec. 1, it will hold a hearing on the new regulations, which would strip away the discount from all family limited partnerships regardless of what they hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this is one of the sticking points for planners. Many argue that partnerships that hold businesses should still be entitled to the discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been abuses in the past, like when families took a $100 million of marketable securities and wrapped them in a family limited partnership wrapper and took a discount,'' said Christopher Pegg, regional wealth planning manager for Southern California at Wells Fargo Private Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But what happens if it's a $100 million corrugated steel company and the family owns it and Mom dies with a 20 percent stake?'' he added. ''The new regulations say that stake is worth $20 million. That's not what it's worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pegg pointed out that if nonfamily members owned the same private company, the I.R.S. would allow a discount for the very same lack of marketability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We cannot assume that one family acts together,'' he said. ''It's worse in many cases being in with family than with strangers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax experts do not rule out that these new regulations, although labeled final, could be changed in the comment period. Their enactment, which is set for 30 days after they become final, could also be delayed. At the earliest they would take effect on Dec. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, predicting when the regulations will take effect is beyond people's control and could be risky for those who would benefit from a family partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no mulligan,'' said Mark Parthemer, senior fiduciary counsel at Bessemer Trust. ''If a family is considering doing some tax planning and they're putting it off to next year, they can't go back in time and take advantage of the discounts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some planners are drawing parallels to the fourth quarter of 2012, when wealthy people scrambled to make gifts under what was then a $5.12 million exemption for individuals. The rush was generated by the fear that the Obama administration would abolish or greatly reduce the exemption in 2013. Instead, the government kept it in place, with an annual increase for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the very wealthy, there is good reason to set up a family limited partnership by the end of the year. The discounting, for example, can turn a $10 million gift into $6.5 million for tax purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the proposed changes go into effect as planned, they will certainly have an effect on certain very wealthy families. ''We're telling clients to move quickly,'' Mr. Pegg said. He said that it typically takes six months to set up a family limited partnership, but if families were motivated and focused on this they could set one up in about 45 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Mark Williamson, a partner leading the wealth planning practice at the law firm <span class="companylink">Alston &amp; Bird</span>, said people who have already given shares in family limited partnerships at steep discounts are protected, as long as they filed the proper gift tax forms and the three-year statute of limitations on audits has passed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if discounting goes away, the ability to save on tax, protect assets from creditors and pass any future appreciation on to the next generation still exists through tax planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Valuation discounts have always been the icing on the cake for these tax transfers that we do,'' said Scott Goldberger, estate and trust principal at the accounting firm Kaufman Rossin in Boca Raton, Fla. ''If the primary goal is to push future appreciation of the business onto family members, thereby reducing the value of the taxable estate, the discount gives you a head start.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the discount, there are two effective strategies to move money or business interests to heirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is simply getting assets that are going to appreciate out of a person's estate. If the gift is over the exemption amount, the person may have to pay gift tax. But after that, all future appreciation will grow outside of his or her estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second is to put those assets into what is called a grantor trust, which benefits future recipients by allowing the person making the gift to pay all the income taxes in the trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those two in tandem will typically outweigh the tax savings you'd get from a discount,'' Mr. Goldberger said. ''Even after these regulations are finalized, we think we'll still be seeing a lot of our clients doing this type of planning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seth R. Kaplan, a shareholder with the law firm Gunster, said he recommends some type of family entity for any family with more than $10 million in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are multiple tax as well as nontax benefits to this, like creditor protection,'' he said. ''It lays the foundation for other planning, like charitable planning. It achieves some of the goals of centralized management. It can be given to other family members.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is that desire for control and protection of the assets that planners say may be the most valuable benefit. If someone is sued, the assets inside the partnership are viewed as separate from the individual's assets, just as they would be in a well-crafted trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That partnership structure also gives the family the ability to bind family interests together. This may not always be what beneficiaries want, but it is meant to ensure that a family business has the best chance of continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are many elements to intrafamily planning,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''It's not the end of the world if it'' -- the discount -- ''goes away.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- <span class="companylink">Evernote</span>, a Silicon Valley start-up that makes a note-taking app, was supposed to be dead by now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a stratospheric rise over the last few years, during which investors poured about $270 million into the company and valued it at $1 billion, <span class="companylink">Evernote</span> hit hard times last year. Naysayers said the company had overexpanded, was spending too much money and would be destroyed by competitors. The start-up soon became the poster child of a coming collapse in Silicon Valley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve months later, <span class="companylink">Evernote</span> has cut back on staff, eliminated employee perks like free housecleaning services, simplified its product line -- and stabilized. The number of customers who pay for its file storage and sharing product is on track to grow as much as 40 percent this year, and the company is hiring again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here we sit, a year after we were supposed to die,'' said Chris O'Neill, 43, chief executive of the start-up, which is based in Redwood City, Calif. ''It was hard for employees to readjust expectations. They had only known a world where another fund-raise was just around the corner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley start-ups were set to face a great reckoning in 2016. Yet the crash hasn't happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, many tech executives, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs were convinced that a multiyear boom that had propelled young companies to great heights could no longer sustain itself. Some said it would end apocalyptically. Michael Moritz, an influential start-up investor at <span class="companylink">Sequoia Capital</span>, declared many of the companies ''the flimsiest of edifices.'' Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist at the Silicon Valley firm Benchmark, proclaimed that the start-ups would bite the dust. ''Winter is coming,'' others intoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst fallout may yet come, but many of the start-ups have hung on. Across Silicon Valley, engineers are still commanding annual salaries that average $136,000, according to Hired, a recruiting firm. Demand is brisk for $4 buttered toast, and office space rents remain near record highs. The biggest start-ups, like Uber and <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, continue to land billions of dollars in funding. And investors are shoveling money into venture capital funds, which raised so much cash in the first half of this year that it rivaled the amount raised in all of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of the hand-wringing, ''there just hasn't been much of a downturn,'' said Paul Buchheit, a managing partner at <span class="companylink">Y Combinator</span>, a prominent start-up incubator that nurtured companies including <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span> and <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>. ''I don't even see many companies going out of business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not to say there has been no adjustment. Some smaller start-ups, like the live-streaming app Blab and the on-demand private chef company Kitchit, have collapsed into Silicon Valley's dead pool. Other young companies have laid off staff. And many entrepreneurs are no longer able to demand whatever valuation they please for their companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it is precisely these adaptations that have allowed many Silicon Valley start-ups to stick it out -- for now, at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The start-up world did heed the warnings,'' said Max Levchin, a former employee and a founder of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and the chief executive of Affirm, a lending start-up in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley's innovation engine continues even with the survival of so many start-ups -- and not just the fittest -- because of the abundance of venture capital. There has been a proliferation of new enterprises in up-and-coming fields like artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality, creating potential areas of growth for Silicon Valley technologists to build on next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For techies who have been grappling with the not-yet-a-crash environment, the adjustment in their outlook is evident in their speech. Entrepreneurs who once talked about how fast their start-ups were growing are now spouting from a bible of fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Behr, the chief executive of the parking service Zirx, epitomizes the change. The company, named after the Ukrainian word for star, was in the ''on-demand'' space, providing valet parking with the touch of a smartphone button. Mr. Behr said his goal was to make all of Zirx's consumers feel like stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But each customer was so expensive to acquire and serve that Zirx lost money and consumers in all six cities where it operated. By late last year, Zirx, a San Francisco start-up that had raised $36 million, had only about a year's worth of cash left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in January, Mr. Behr, 41, walked his employees through nearly 40 PowerPoint slides detailing the company's precarious finances and explained that Zirx needed to take drastic actions. That month, he told customers Zirx was shutting down its on-demand businesses where valets would park cars for any customer who asked and would instead focus on more lucrative corporate clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors used to say grow, grow, grow and don't worry about costs,'' Mr. Behr said. ''Now you're encouraged to not run out of money and make sure you'll be around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Zirx is profitable in eight of its nine markets, he said. The company has preserved $10 million from its last financing round to keep in the bank for a rainier day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Bannerman, a 16-person security guard start-up based in San Francisco, Johnny Chin, the chief executive, also narrowed the company's focus after warnings of a crash. While the start-up once pursued several types of customers, it began concentrating on serving only medium-size offices and property managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was losing money last year, but it is now profitable. Start-ups ''started to cut their most frivolous spending,'' said Mr. Chin, 30. ''People are just cautious. It's healthier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other entrepreneurs have a newfound air of practicality, no longer shooting for their companies to be the next tech behemoth like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Denman, chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up Emotient, was trying to drum up more money for his company last year when he heard the talk about a coming start-up calamity. So to hedge his bets, he started talking to potential buyers, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2013, I wouldn't have thought about selling,'' said Mr. Denman, 58. But all the concerns ''encouraged folks to behave in whatever way would give them the greatest chance to succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, he sold his four-year-old company for an undisclosed amount to Apple, where most of his team now works. ''I looked at all the variables and wanted to do what was the best thing for the employees and the company,'' said Mr. Denman, who is taking a break after the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Silicon Valley start-up crash may still take place, especially if the stock market tanks or if there is a financial shock to the system. And some tech investors like Mr. Gurley, the venture capitalist, are still sounding the alarm. In April, Mr. Gurley wrote a blog post that laid out how venture investors remain overcapitalized to a dangerous degree, which made investing in start-ups more risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there has been no crash since then, he does not regret any prognostications. He said he was glad if young companies had stopped overspending because of his warnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Funding for just anything under the sun has gone away,'' Mr. Gurley said. ''I spoke out because the longer those things go on, the worse things end up later on. This is the impact I wanted to have.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HANGZHOU, China -- In Dream Town, a collection of boxy office buildings on the gritty edge of this historic city, one tiny company is developing a portable 3-D printer. Another takes orders for traditional Chinese massages by smartphone. They are just two of the 710 start-ups being nurtured here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anywhere else, an incubator like Dream Town would be a vision of venture capitalists, angel investors or technology stalwarts. But this is China. The Chinese Communist Party doesn't trust the invisible hand of capitalism alone to encourage entrepreneurship, especially since it is a big part of the leadership's strategy to reshape the sagging economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why the government of Hangzhou -- a former royal capital that has been a major commercial hub for more than a millennium -- built Dream Town and lavishes resources on start-ups. The businesses here get a slate of benefits like subsidized rent, cash handouts and special training, all courtesy of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chemayi, which offers car repair services through a smartphone app, is staying rent-free at Dream Town for three years and is applying for as much as $450,000 in subsidies from city authorities to help pay salaries and buy equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From the central government all the way down to local governments, we have seen a lot of warm support,'' said Li Liheng, co-founder and chief executive of Chemayi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of China's long economic boom, young people flocked to manufacturing zones for jobs making bluejeans or iPhones. But today China is trying to move beyond just being the world's factory floor. Policy makers want the next generation to find better-paying work in modern offices, creating the ideas, technologies and jobs to feed the country's future growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premier Li Keqiang frequently calls for ''mass entrepreneurship.'' In March at the National People's Congress, he bragged that 12,000 new companies were founded each day in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurial embrace comes with lots of financial support. Across the country, officials are creating investment funds, providing cash subsidies and building incubators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without these kinds of subsidies, you only rely on private money, and you wouldn't see so many technology start-ups happening today,'' said Ning Tao, a partner at Innovation Works, a venture capital fund in Beijing. ''Without quantity, you cannot have quality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the heavy spending is adding to worries about an inflating bubble in the world of China's tiniest companies. Along with the government funds, venture capital money is flooding the country. About $49 billion in deals were made last year, making China second only to the United States, according to the accounting firm <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and entrepreneurs are concerned that the government is helping fuel a frenzy that might ultimately result in failed businesses, wasted resources and financial losses. Just one city, Suzhou, near Shanghai, has announced it will open 300 incubators by 2020 to house 30,000 start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing's policy makers have a long history of giving favored companies easy access to loans and subsidies to propel certain industries, with both good and bad consequences. Though that tactic lubricated the nation's industrialization, it also contributed to the excess that has buried the country in empty apartment blocks, mothballed cement plants and sputtering steel mills -- all of which threaten the economy's stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the subsidies shouldn't be a long-term policy,'' Jin Xiangrong, an economist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, said of the start-up support programs. ''They can lead to overcapacity like the kind we see now in China's manufacturing sector, which is largely a result of government support.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangzhou city officials turned down requests for interviews.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Children of Alibaba</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Dream Town, Mr. Li, 39, frets more about his own business. He got the initial idea for Chemayi in 2009 after a car accident. To find a trustworthy mechanic, he searched online, asked friends for advice and visited repair shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Li found it difficult to judge who was reliable. A car culture -- and all the services that come with it -- is relatively new in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aiming to fill the information void, he and three friends set up Chemayi in 2013 with 5 million renminbi (currently $750,000) of their own money. For an annual fee, Chemayi sends out staff members to help fix flat tires, paint scratches or repair broken-down engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Henry Ford is gone for so many years, but we are still driving his cars,'' Mr. Li said. ''I felt that I also must pursue a cause that will persist after I'm gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chemayi beat out more than two dozen other start-ups for a coveted space in Dream Town in a 2014 competition. Another co-founder, Ouyang Feng, delivered a 40-minute presentation to a panel of judges who peppered him with questions about Chemayi's business model and future prospects. The provincial governor watched over the grilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the committee awarded Chemayi a three-foot golden key that symbolically opened the doors to Dream Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chemayi now has 284 employees in four cities, with plans to reach 1,000 by the end of the year. Mr. Li said his company had raised $22 million in private money and turned a profit of about 10 million renminbi last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of Chinese people want to be successful. They want to initiate change through innovation,'' Mr. Li said in his spacious corner office, while fussing with a traditional Chinese wooden tea-making set. ''That is a formidable power.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangzhou is a natural center for China's start-up fever. After China embraced capitalist reform in the 1980s, Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital, emerged as a leading base for the export industries that fueled the country's rapid growth. Factories pumped out products like socks and plastic Christmas trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that zeal for commerce is being channeled into technology start-ups. Hangzhou is home to China's most famous internet company, the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has become a training ground for would-be entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhoods near Alibaba's sprawling campus, once a poorly developed area on the city's outskirts, now make up a budding tech center with newly built office parks like Dream Town, dominated by ambitious college graduates, angel investors and venture capitalists. The local restaurants have become hangouts to exchange ideas and gossip over fried squid and stewed pork and eggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Feng Xiao is typical of this new breed. Mr. Feng, 39 and a Hangzhou native, spent 11 years at Alibaba, mainly in sales and marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a Chinese proverb, 'The soil is too rich,''' Mr. Feng said. Alibaba ''offered you a lot of opportunities. It was easy to have a sense of success. But I wanted to be able to start from scratch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His start-up was born in Alibaba's cafeteria, where he ate meal after meal. ''I really missed Mom's cooking,'' he said. He figured that many other people, trapped working for long hours far from home, felt the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feng and two other Alibaba employees left their jobs in 2014 and opened a food delivery service, Mishi. Their plan was to connect people willing to prepare homemade meals with on-the-go professionals who were too busy to cook. They set up shop in a friend's empty house, decorated with secondhand furniture and photos from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with raising $19 million from private investors, Mishi caught the eye of the Hangzhou city government. In 2014, district officials awarded Mishi 5 million renminbi to help pay the bills. Its rent in a Hangzhou office park is also subsidized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most important thing on the part of the government is whether they are open'' to new types of businesses, Mr. Feng said. ''We are glad to see they are aggressively supporting us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangzhou represents what Chinese leaders see as the nation's economic future. The country used to generate astronomical growth rates by depending heavily on low-cost exports and extremely high investment in apartment towers, factories and highways. China built so many steel mills that it can produce 10 times as much steel as the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today, costs are rising, eating away at the competitiveness of many export industries. The long investment boom has saddled the economy with too many factories and a mountain of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, policy makers are encouraging a shift to new growth engines, like services and high tech. The entrepreneurial focus is providing an economic boost for Hangzhou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's gross domestic product rose 10.2 percent in 2015, compared with the 6.9 percent national growth rate. Hangzhou's service sector, which includes many start-ups, was the main engine of that strong performance, surging 14.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chinese know that state-owned enterprises are not going to employ everybody,'' said Hans Tung, a managing partner at <span class="companylink">GGV Capital</span>, a venture capital firm that operates in both Silicon Valley and China. ''They need young people to create jobs for themselves, so they are encouraging them to try something new.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mishi, the food delivery start-up, has created 100 full-time jobs, and has bolstered the incomes of more than 10,000 home chefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cai Liangen, a retired businessman turned Mishi cook, learned about the start-up when a marketing team visited his apartment complex seeking to enlist new chefs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, he and his wife began making local specialties in their kitchen, including a sliced pork dish prepared with ''my mother's secret recipe,'' Mr. Cai said. They now receive 40 orders a day and earn 5,000 renminbi a month, increasing their total income 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do it because we love to cook,'' Mr. Cai said, ''but the money is good to have, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Swell of Subsidies</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After submitting a 10-page proposal in 2014 to join a Hangzhou incubator, Ai Binke sat nervously before a committee of tech industry executives who questioned his future prospects. His software company, Yun Ran Internet of Things, had only four employees, and its business deals had been small. But his start-up, Mr. Ai explained to the committee, had great potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was sufficient for the judges to award him 100,000 renminbi in subsidies. The bulk, roughly 70 percent, was instantly transferred into his corporate bank account. ''As long as you run projects that are encouraged by the Hangzhou government, you can get the subsidies,'' said Mr. Ai, 29. ''It's not very difficult.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local governments around China are spending heavily on start-ups. In Shenzhen, authorities are offering to subsidize up to 70 percent of rent for ''creative'' start-ups. Local officials in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu are setting up a 200 million renminbi ''entrepreneurship and innovation development fund'' and promising subsidies of up to 5 million renminbi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in Guangdong province in China's south will cover part of a start-up's losses. Even the lesser-known city of Yingtan, in an area of Jiangxi province mainly known for its ancient Taoist temples, is planning to build an incubator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangzhou's government has been one of the more active. Officials are forming a venture capital fund of 4.7 billion renminbi , with contributions from companies, according to the city's website. This year, Hangzhou announced that it would give 100 million renminbi annually to help start-ups pay expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But governments historically have a spotty record of using state-directed money to generate business success stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Japan's high-growth decades, its bureaucrats tried to ''pick winners'' by selecting certain industries for support. Though they nurtured a few internationally competitive industries (shipbuilding and steel), they also had significant failures (chemicals and computer software). The Obama administration got a black eye for its financial aid to the solar technology firm <span class="companylink">Solyndra</span>, which sank into bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, government efforts to assist new businesses have often led to waste and excess. Too much investment pours into favored industries, spawning poorly conceived projects in areas like hotels and solar panels. By trying to spur start-ups, the state is also engaging in a high-risk business that even for the most experienced venture capitalist is prone to produce more failures than successes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hangzhou officials are trying to avoid such pitfalls. At Dream Town, the financial aid is often linked to a start-up's performance. The amount of free rent depends on how much private capital a company can raise. Cash handouts are tied to revenue targets or top-selling apps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials also enlist professionals to help allocate the city's money. The committee that judges applicants to Dream Town is usually made up of tech executives, financiers and academics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ye Feng, a manager at another incubator who has sat as a judge on three occasions, said she quizzed the contenders on their technology, business plan and even product pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually about 30 start-ups appear at each competition. No more than four make the cut to enter Dream Town. ''The competition is quite fierce,'' Ms. Ye said. ''Sometimes it's hard to make a decision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some in Hangzhou fear that the government is doling out too much money, and it is flowing to start-ups with weak business plans and feeble prospects. Mr. Ai of Yun Ran said that two neighbors also received city subsidies. One, a robotics start-up, failed to attract private capital and closed, while the other, a mobile game company, is struggling to stay afloat as its business withers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government money, Mr. Ai said, often cannot replace the private capital necessary for start-ups. ''Without financing, it would be very hard for them to survive,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's still learning. Now 60, Mr. Chenoweth, with a 65-year-old partner, recently started a business called Here's My Story, whose gaming app brings history alive through location-based role-playing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It works with Harpers Ferry National Historic Park, where users participate in the lives of historical figures. Slaves, soldiers and nurses are depicted through an interactive process that takes the oral storytelling of Mr. Chenoweth's childhood beyond the front porch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't easy to become an entrepreneur later in life. Originally a novelist, Mr. Chenoweth had a major heart attack that left him too fatigued to write. He had to look elsewhere to pay the bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He began working for Hertz, earning minimum wage by returning rental vehicles that had been abandoned. One car used in a drug deal had ''nine bullet holes in the window,'' he said. ''It was just shot to smithereens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, a friend, Philippe Sommer, told him about an incubator at the Darden School of Business of the <span class="companylink">University of Virginia in Charlottesville</span>, where Mr. Chenoweth lives. Known as i.Lab, it began by offering mentorship and courses to support students starting businesses. When Mr. Sommer took over the leadership, he opened it to local residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At that point it was like shifting gears and flipping on the lights and going in and, you know, just coming back to myself again,'' Mr. Chenoweth said. ''Full speed, full lights, full energy. It was just completely rejuvenating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now in robust health, Mr. Chenoweth still found being older than most of the other participants, many of them M.B.A. students, a challenge. He didn't have the technological experience to follow through with his idea, and he knew that going out on his own would be risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As you get older, the ceiling isn't glass,'' he said. ''It's concrete. Or even worse, it's made out of wood and covered with silk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many older Americans want to start a business but find they lack certain skills, and sometimes also the confidence to try something new. In response, more organizations focused on training entrepreneurs are targeting baby boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Y.W.C.A. San Francisco and Marin Fifty Plus Program offers training, mentoring and placement for women 50 and over. One 68-year-old woman, who asked not to be named for fear of age discrimination, started a bookkeeping business thanks to the program's QuickBooks training and mentorship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a partnership between AARP and the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>. The organization and the federal agency, which both have local offices in every state, provide workshops and webinars tailored to local needs. Other groups include the Renaissance Entrepreneur Center in San Francisco, and S.B.A.'s numerous local partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some groups focus specifically on an older crowd, those like Darden's iLab that offer training for entrepreneurs are also growing accustomed to seeing this age group. As Mr. Chenoweth says, ''It's more about temperament than age.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Blumberg, chief executive and managing director of Energy Foundry, which makes early-stage investments in energy start-ups, offers one example of the advantages of experience. ''Clean tech is not a new industry,'' he said. ''It's redefining and upending an old industry and pieces of old industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To do that,'' he added, ''you need to have a lot of knowledge of the industry that you're competing in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</span> found that 24.3 percent of new entrepreneurs in 2015 were ages 55 to 64, compared with 14.8 percent in 1996. The <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> reports that one in four people between 44 and 70 are interested in becoming entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone over 50 wants to be an entrepreneur, of course, but more than a third of Americans 50 to 64 anticipate working for pay after reaching the traditional retirement age of 65. Can entrepreneurship open opportunities for them as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa A. Berman is president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors</span> and a professor at the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise at <span class="companylink">Columbia Business School</span>. She says the concept of social entrepreneurship -- ''an innovative and creative way to meet a social need'' -- can be applied to employment of older people just as much as, say, to building facilities for clean water in Africa or providing microcredit to artisan women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is where the Global Good Fund, through the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation Fellowship, has decided to try to make its mark. The new fellowship, which is now accepting applications, is for entrepreneurs who create jobs for Americans 50 and older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Global Good Fund, which began with a program for emerging entrepreneurs from around the world, will apply that same model to the new fellowship. Fellows participate in rigorous training, working with professional coaches and mentors over 15 months -- a length of time that, according to Ms. Berman, avoids ''drive-by mentoring'' that is ''not likely to create lasting help for the entrepreneur.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coaches from previous years have included Ted Leonsis, founder and chief executive of Monumental Sports and Entertainment, and Lydia Thomas, former president and chief executive of Noblis, a nonprofit research group based outside Washington. On the fellowship's board of advisers are Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who founded <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span> in Bangladesh, and Sheila Johnson, one of the founders of Black Entertainment Television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of coaching and evaluating skills, the fellows are to meet for five days of what José V. Fernández, the fund's director of programs, calls ''an intense boot camp on leadership.'' They will also collaborate online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is employing baby boomers a worthy goal of social entrepreneurship?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Companies flourish in diversity,'' Mr. Fernández said. ''The immense experience and the different challenges and contexts that this community has faced makes them an invaluable asset. They understand a market that is being disregarded. It's not only the employment of this group, but that this group as a buyer has been extremely overlooked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chenoweth, who hasn't lost his novelist's way with words, is among those planning to apply for the Global Good Fund fellowship. ''It will be another opportunity,'' he said, to ''try to lasso lightning and pull it down and put it in a bottle.''</p>

Trump agrees to release his tax returns before the Oct. 19 presidential debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoffman announced his challenge in a statement published Monday on Medium that said he was offering a matching donation to support a crowdfunding campaign started by Peter Kiernan, a former Marine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By midday Tuesday, Mr. Kiernan's fund-raising on Crowdpac.com had raised more than $74,000 toward its $1 million goal of donating funds to 10 nonprofit organizations that help war veterans. Mr. Hoffman offered to match those donations 5 to 1 up to $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that offer was inspired by Mr. Trump's own pledge in 2012 to donate that amount to a charity if President Obama revealed his college and passport records and applications. At the time, Mr. Trump had been questioning whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States (indeed he was, in Hawaii).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Taking Trump's own 2012 offer to President Obama into account, I'd like to assist Kiernan in his campaign,'' Mr. Hoffman wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a functioning democracy, the public shouldn't be forced to bargain with a major presidential candidate to obtain access to his tax returns,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's failure to release his tax returns has drawn criticism not only from supporters of Hillary Clinton but from prominent Republicans, including Mitt Romney, who lost to Mr. Obama in 2012. On Friday, Mr. Trump's running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, released a decade of his own tax returns, but Mr. Trump and his campaign have said that the nominee would not release his until an <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> audit was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Clinton released a batch of returns last month. They showed that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million for 2015. They paid about $3.6 million in federal taxes for an effective tax rate of about 35 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Candidates are not required to release their returns, but if Mr. Trump fails to do so before the election, he would be the first major-party presidential nominee in four decades to withhold them. This has fueled speculation that Mr. Trump's returns would reveal facts about his wealth, charitable donations, business relationships or tax arrangements that might be politically damaging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The returns might resolve questions about Mr. Trump's own charitable giving. The <span class="companylink">Washington Post</span> has reported that the candidate has exaggerated the amount he has donated to veterans groups over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An emailed request to the Trump campaign for comment about Mr. Hoffman's pledge was not immediately returned on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, Mr. Hoffman, formerly the chief operating officer of PayPal, formed a small team to work on what would become <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span>, a professional networking site. It was introduced in 2003. This June, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> said it would acquire <span class="companylink">LinkedIn</span> for $26.2. billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After posting his pledge to Medium, Mr. Hoffman later updated it to disclose that he had at one time made an investment in Crowdpac.com. A Buzzfeed report and Shane Goldmacher, a Politico reporter, noted that Mr. Hoffman had promoted Crowdpac before by signing on to a campaign to recall the judge in the <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span> rape case, Aaron Persky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ingenuity of Kiernan's proposal is how it gives Trump a strong incentive to act but doesn't reward him directly for something he should have already done,'' Mr. Hoffman wrote. ''Instead, men and women to whom all Americans owe a great debt of gratitude will benefit from any positive action he takes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoffman's announcement was reported on Monday night by news media including Forbes, which noted that Mr. Keirnan's campaign had raised a meager $5,000 before the post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is crazy, please help me get to this goal,'' Mr. Kiernan said on his campaign page after the announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 26-year-old former Marine who served in Afghanistan in 2012, he wrote on Monday that the campaign was a way to take advantage of the ''political climate'' to raise money while also holding Mr. Trump accountable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nation entrusts its defense to this small group of talented and determined patriots, in return for this responsibility the nation asks for honesty and integrity,'' he wrote, addressing Mr. Trump. ''I believe that to be the Commander-in-Chief of this group, you should be held to the same standards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that it would not cost Mr. Trump any money, just the release of his returns. He added: ''So what do you say Mr. Trump, can you walk away from this deal?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A few hours after Donald J. Trump publicly backed away from a $1 trillion tax cut for small businesses, campaign aides on Thursday privately assured a leading small-business group that Mr. Trump in fact remained committed to the proposal -- winning the group's endorsement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign then told the <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span>, a conservative-leaning Washington think tank it asked to price the plan, that Mr. Trump had indeed decided to eliminate the tax cut.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it the trillion-dollar lie: Both assertions cannot be true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is whether Mr. Trump's plan would tax small businesses, partnerships and other ''passthrough'' entities at the same 15 percent rate as large corporations, as he proposed last year, or whether they would continue to pay individual income taxes, at rates as high as 33 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign's conflicting accounts of its own proposal are particularly remarkable because Mr. Trump and his advisers have taken months to refine the details, which Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, unveiled in an economic policy speech on Thursday in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, however, telling two versions of the same story benefited the Trump campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dropping the tax cut was central to Mr. Trump's optimistic claim that his plan would not increase the federal debt. But by simultaneously promising to keep the tax cut, the campaign won the support of the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, an influential small-business lobbying group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're comfortable'' that Mr. Trump is committed to preserving the tax break, Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the group, said Friday morning. ''We have it directly from his campaign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span> was not so comfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a disconnect between the plan as understood by us and the plan as understood by the N.F.I.B.,'' said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation who worked on the cost estimate that Mr. Trump cited in his speech. ''And I think your inquiry into this is probably a productive one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump's finance chairman, said Friday that the campaign's tax plan had not changed at any point on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Mr. Trump was proposing to let any business pay the same low tax rate, 15 percent, on all income retained for business purposes. In effect, that would apply corporate tax rates to some passthrough income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The intent of the plan is that big and small businesses have tax relief,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He declined to comment on the conflicting accounts provided by the two groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is much at stake in the details, both in tax dollars and in the politics of a tax-code overhaul. Passthrough businesses, which range from mom-and-pop shops to law firms and large real estate partnerships, have become increasingly common in recent decades and now produce more than half of all business income. Under current law, that income is passed through to the tax returns of the business owners, where it is taxed at the same rates as a worker's wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporations generally pay a lower tax rate, but shareholders must also pay a second round of taxes on any corporate profits distributed as dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Democrats and Republicans want to overhaul the corporate tax system, which combines a high headline rate with endless loopholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the question of what to do about passthroughs has bedeviled those efforts. Democrats have resisted changes to small-business taxes because they have not wanted to lower the top income tax rates for individuals -- the rates small businesses pay. Republicans have stood firmly against a tax overhaul for corporations only, worrying that leaving small-business taxes unchanged would look elitist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That standoff has left intact a corporate tax code that both sides believe has put American companies at a global disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump proposed last year to sharply reduce the corporate rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and to apply the same rate to passthrough income. Democrats sharply criticized that proposal as a giveaway to the owners of passthrough businesses, a group that includes many real estate developers like Mr. Trump, because they would not need to pay a second round of taxes on dividends. The <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span> says it would cost the government about $1 trillion over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Trump's campaign initially indicated that it had decided to abandon that plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump took the stage at the Waldorf Astoria, before the members of the Economic Club of New York, and declared that his new tax plan would cost just $2.6 trillion, far less than the estimated $10 trillion price tag for the previous version of his plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That estimated cost came from the <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span>, which performed an analysis based on the specific changes detailed by the Trump campaign, including the elimination of the small-business tax cut, the <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span>'s Mr. Cole said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump campaign also issued a summary of the proposal that said Mr. Trump intended to reduce the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent, but made no mention of passthroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mozloom said his group, which strongly advocates a small-business cut, was surprised and reached out to the campaign. A few hours later, convinced by campaign aides that Mr. Trump intended to keep the tax break, the N.F.I.B. renewed its endorsement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We strongly support Mr. Trump's proposal to create a single business tax rate that would create parity between small businesses and their larger competitors,'' Juanita Duggan, the group's president, said in the statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump campaign also changed the language of its proposal to refer to the ''business'' tax rate rather than ''corporate'' tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after learning about the endorsement Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cole of the <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span> said that he spoke again to the campaign and that he was assured Mr. Trump still intended to eliminate the tax cut. The campaign told him it was making a more modest change in the plan that would reduce taxation for some small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of the Trump campaign's plan remain unclear, as does the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a proposal and it's in the process of being priced out and some details are being filled in,'' said Larry Kudlow, an economic commentator and adviser to Mr. Trump. ''If Mr. Trump becomes president and submits this legislation, it will all have to get worked through,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Kyle Pomerleau, the Tax Foundation's director of federal projects, said he had hoped to publish an analysis of Mr. Trump's plan on Friday, but it remained incomplete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As time goes on,'' he said, ''unfortunately things are becoming less clear.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHOULD the goal of public policy be to ensure that all Americans can have good jobs -- or good lives? Politicians of both parties say one thing. Policy experts of both parties say another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians routinely promise that, if elected, they will create more good jobs, which are understood to be jobs with solid wages, regular hours and, perhaps, generous employer-provided benefits. In this campaign year, Hillary Clinton promises ''the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II'' by means of a mixture of tough trade negotiations, investment in domestic manufacturing, infrastructure investment, research and development, regulatory relief for small business, debt-free higher education and a tax credit to subsidize apprenticeships. Donald Trump proposes to protect American workers from competition with illegal immigrants, the offshoring of jobs by United States-based corporations and harmful practices by trading partners like China.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from the campaign stops, in university and think tank offices, the emerging consensus is quite different: Americans should be able to enjoy good lives, even if they have ''bad'' jobs -- jobs with low wages, irregular hours and no employer-provided benefits. Bipartisan experts tend to agree that the decline in employer-provided benefits and the rise of unconventional work arrangements are trends that should be accommodated, by reforms including new portable benefits and expanded income maintenance programs, like tax credits for low-income workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For several decades, this consensus has been reflected in what legislators have actually been doing. Slowly, incrementally, Americans have been moving away from a system in which a good job with a generous employer was the key to having a good life to a new system in which even people with low-wage jobs can have access to the basic goods and services that define a decent life in a modern society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One piece of the new system includes the earned-income tax credit, a means-tested wage subsidy that has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation in 1975. Expanding wage subsidies is one way to compensate for the low wages paid by many of the new jobs that are being created. According to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, 94.6 percent of jobs added from 2014 to 2024 will be in the service sector. The single largest employer of near-minimum wage workers, the restaurant and food service industry, is one of the sectors with the greatest projected job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another example is provided by jobs in the health care and social assistance sector. These jobs are projected to grow much more rapidly than the average for all occupations, increasing by 38 percent between 2012 and 2024 and accounting for 3.8 of the 9.3 million new service sector jobs. Many health-related jobs are poorly paid. Home health aides, who need no formal educational credentials and whose median annual wage is $21,850, now significantly outnumber better-paid and better-educated licensed nurses (median wage: $43,090). And low-wage home health aides are more than three times more numerous than medical and health services managers (median wage: $92,710).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support for expanding the earned-income tax credit or other wage subsidies to compensate for low-wage service jobs like these is shared by Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and progressives like the former labor secretary Robert Reich. The E.I.T.C. supplements statutory federal and state minimum wages. Mrs. Clinton supports a federal minimum wage of $12 to $15 an hour. Mr. Trump says he supports an increase to $10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, fewer employers are providing health insurance to their workers. As of March 2016, no more than 41 percent of workers in the bottom quarter of wage earners had access to sick leave. Part-time workers are even worse off. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- enacted into law in 2010 sought to ensure that all Americans without employer-provided health insurance had access to affordable health insurance, through either Medicaid, state-regulated exchanges or a federal exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employer-provided, defined-benefit pensions with guaranteed benefits are also becoming a thing of the past. Among workers fortunate enough to participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans, defined-benefit pensions alone plummeted from more than 60 percent in 1979 to fewer than 10 percent in 2011, when around 70 percent of workers with employer plans had 401(k)'s. Roughly half of American workers don't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's no surprise that nearly half of working-age families have no retirement savings at all -- and for individuals between 56 and 61, the median retirement account holds only $17,000. Here again, many Democrats and Republicans agree that the answer is to detach retirement security from particular employers, though it should still depend on how much you work. A number of states have considered creating state-sponsored retirement savings plans for private sector workers without employer-provided retirement savings plans. California, Illinois, Oregon and Massachusetts have already established such programs. California's new Secure Choice plan will require employers that do not provide 401(k)'s to automatically enroll their workers in an individual retirement account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the 1970s to the present, then, mostly with bipartisan support (the glaring exception was Obamacare), American policy makers have responded to the decline of high-wage jobs and generous employer-based benefits by gradually expanding the role of the government in ensuring that Americans have adequate income and adequate benefits. Most of this expansion has taken place in what the political scientist Christopher Howard calls ''the hidden welfare state'' and the political scientist Suzanne Mettler describes as ''the submerged state.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This huge government sector is made up of tax credits, federal grants-in-aid to the states and low-interest loan programs like student loans. Many of these indirect programs, like entitlements and tax breaks for health care, retirement and housing, are not counted as part of the conventional federal budget. This allows Congress to stealthily expand the size of government while pretending not to. The individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, for example, is a tax, though an unusual one, as the Supreme Court found when upholding its legitimacy in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of direct spending on social welfare, the United States seems miserly compared with many other developed nations. But according to a recent study for the <span class="companylink">Peterson Institute for International Economics</span> by Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, this is an illusion. When tax-favored private social spending is combined with public spending, American public expenditures at 20.8 percent of G.D.P. are only a little lower than the average in 21 states of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. Mr. Kirkegaard concludes, ''Taking the full effects of tax systems and social spending from both private and public sources into account, the United States is seen to be devoting more resources toward social purposes than is generally acknowledged.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preserving the fiction of a small federal government by relying on the hidden welfare state to deliver benefits sometimes comes at a cost. For example, unemployment insurance is not a simple, straightforward, uniform federal program, but a hodgepodge of separate state programs financed partly by the federal government and partly by the states. During economic downturns, this design often creates crises, because the federal government can more easily borrow money in recessions than state governments bound by balanced budget provisions in their state constitutions. And as Suzanne Mettler has pointed out, the importance of indirect benefits in America creates political problems, too. Middle-class American voters often underestimate how many government benefits they receive, while overestimating the cost of means-tested welfare for the poor. Unfortunately, the preference of American policy makers for what the political scientist Steven Teles calls ''kludgeocracy'' -- indirect, complex, off-budget mechanisms rather than simple public programs financed through higher taxes -- seems likely to persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back over the last half-century, we can discern a long-term trend in which the United States government at all levels has been gradually responding to the decline of high-wage, high-benefit jobs, by methods such as gradually socializing benefits (state-run retirement plans) and partly subsidizing wages (the earned-income tax credit). Is this a trend to be welcomed or feared?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One criticism is that the growing socialization of wages and benefits, combined with the decline of employer-provided benefits, transfers responsibility for the well-being of workers from employers and their customers to taxpayers. But any welfare state of any design allows employers to pay somewhat lower wages, because workers do not have to pay for goods like retirement security or health care entirely from their after-tax earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the political problem remains. Even if center-left and center-right policy wonks agree that the goal should be good lives for all workers, even those with bad jobs, many Americans do not agree, to judge from the rhetoric of politicians, who know their audiences well. The replacement of a world in which one or a few lifetime jobs in a paternalistic company that provided benefits during your working life and a pension after your retirement by a future in which individuals struggle to survive by piecing together ''gigs'' and ''tasks'' with a bewildering variety of federal, state and local social programs may strike many workers as a dystopian nightmare. The price of increased flexibility may be increased stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emerging policy agenda tends to shift administrative burdens from employers to the least-educated and worst-paid workers in America. Members of the professional class who are well-remunerated freelancers and can hire tax preparers have a quite different experience of the new economy than high school dropouts who, between part-time shifts, struggle with the paperwork for the earned-income tax credit, Section 8 housing vouchers, food stamps and other benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More opportunities for part-time work can benefit retirees, who are able to rely on Social Security for a basic income. And a <span class="companylink">Pew Research Center</span> poll in 2013 showed that half of working mothers say that part-time work would be ideal for them. For other workers, particularly those in low-wage service jobs, irregular and unpredictable working hours are often unwelcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unelected policy experts who envision a future of multiple job types and a greater, if hidden, role for government in maintaining minimum incomes and providing health and retirement benefits are essentially right. The elements of a ''good job'' -- adequate income, health insurance and retirement benefits -- that were once combined in the package that a Detroit automobile manufacturer provided to a unionized male steelworker in 1950 are likely to be provided, for most American workers now, by some combination of employer and government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until most American workers are persuaded that they will not be worse off in a system characterized by flexible work arrangements and partly socialized benefits, they may continue to make unrealistic demands that 21st century politicians restore something like the occupational structure of the 20th century. Politicians should tell working Americans what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. And what they need to hear is that it is possible for all Americans to have good lives, even if they can't all have good jobs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many employers want to offer one, but uncertainty over costs and a time-consuming setup process deter many.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could explain why only about 14 percent of small businesses have employer-provided plans, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But changes in technology, an expense war in the mutual fund industry and innovative plan offerings have made smaller companies take a second look. In a tight labor market, benefits like retirement plans are increasingly being viewed as necessities to attract quality, long-term employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Nemeroff started Printfly, which runs RushOrderTees.com, a custom T-shirt printing business, with his brother and sister in 2002 in Philadelphia. He began offering a 401(k) retirement plan within the last year for his 180 employees, 80 percent of whom are millennials. It was a great tool for recruiting and retaining employees, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know that investing can be daunting at first,'' Mr. Nemeroff said. ''This gave them an extremely easy method of investing into their future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company offers a 50 percent employer match on the first 3 percent of employee contributions. The company hired 1847 Financial, a division of Penn Mutual, to set up and administer the plan, and employees can invest in several funds offered by American Funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We made sure it was right for our employees,'' Mr. Nemeroff said. It cost about $50,000 to set up the plan, administer it and educate his work force, he said. ''We wanted to make sure our employees understood it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although such costs can be prohibitive for some companies in their early stages, Printfly reported $23 million in sales last year and is projecting growth of 40 to 60 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for most start-ups, seeding a retirement plan doesn't seem as enticing to would-be employees as ownership or recreational benefits. Many typically offer a stake in the company, or nonmonetary benefits like eclectic cafeterias or pool tables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very few start-ups offer retirement plans on Day 1,'' said Jamie Hopkins, a professor at <span class="companylink">the American College of Financial Services</span> in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which trains financial professionals, and a co-director of its New York Life Center for Retirement Income. ''Less than 10 percent of start-ups offer a plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the needle has barely moved when it comes to small companies offering 401(k)s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to employer data analyzed for The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> by <span class="companylink">BrightScope</span>, a financial information company based in San Diego, in 2006, about 36,000 401(k) plans at companies with fewer than 250 employees were ''new,'' or started that calendar year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight years later, slightly more than 34,000 401(k) plans were started by similar-size companies, said Brooks Herman, head of data and research for <span class="companylink">BrightScope</span>, noting that there was a dip in new plans after the 2008 financial crisis. The company's snapshot does not include individual or small-employer individual retirement accounts, so the actual numbers are probably higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Economic and market conditions have a greater effect on new benefits -- like a 401(k) plan being offered -- than the availability of cheap services,'' Mr. Herman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they are subject to various rules and contribution limits, tax deductions are also available to employers for 401(k) plans. Businesses that start such plans can qualify for a tax credit of up to $500 for each of the first three years of their plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify, a business must have at least one employee, other than the owner, who earns less than $120,000 a year. Employers can also deduct any matching contributions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, costs matter for businesses. Entrepreneurs understandably watch every dollar, so the often-steep administrative expenses of a retirement plan can be discouraging. Most conventional 401(k)'s involve a lot of paperwork, filing requirements and continuing administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And small businesses often have higher 401(k) costs than larger corporations. According to a recent report by Employee Fiduciary, a provider of low-cost plans for small businesses, the average ''all-in'' expense -- covering everything -- was 2 percent of assets under management for a sampling of small-business plans with total assets under $2 million. The report looked at about 120 plans and included plans offered by insurance companies, which tend to be more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small employers are often saddled with higher costs because, the argument goes, they do not offer economies of scale. However, the mutual fund and exchange-traded-fund industry is increasingly competing on expenses and has pursued smaller companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Vanguard's Target Retirement 2050 Fund, a ''target-date'' bundle of four of the company's funds for participants who plan to retire around 2050, costs only 0.16 percent in expenses annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business retirement planning is turning into a start-up industry in itself. For instance, Honest Dollar is selling such benefits for a monthly fee of $8 a month per employee, while ForUsAll has begun offering 401(k) plans for smaller companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees and employers alike have also had other retirement savings options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Simplified Employee Pension, or SEP I.R.A., for small-business owners and the self-employed, and the Simple I.R.A., which allows both employees and employers to contribute to an individual retirement account, have been available for decades and require minimal paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees can set up their own I.R.A. or retirement plans, but company-sponsored 401(k)'s have distinct benefits. Employees can contribute up to $18,000 tax free to 401(k)'s, and those 50 or older can contribute an additional $6,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I.R.A.s set up by individuals have contribution limits of $5,500 for employees under age 50. Simple I.R.A. contributions are limited to $12,500 in 2016, plus an additional $3,000 for those 50 or older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, states like California, Illinois and Maryland have moved toward creating their own low-cost programs for small businesses that do not offer retirement plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another emerging inexpensive option is available through robo-advisers, mostly automated services that have streamlined retirement plan access and relatively low expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such robo-advisory firm, Betterment, introduced a 401(k) plan this year catering to businesses. It features <span class="companylink">Vanguard</span> funds, record-keeping, and annual all-in expenses ranging from 0.1 percent to 0.6 percent, according to its website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with most retirement plan expenses, the more assets managed, the lower the total cost. The best price in the Betterment example is for plans with more than $1 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betterment said it had more than 200 companies in its new small-business offering -- 75 percent of which had fewer than 250 employees -- although it would not disclose how many were start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrywide push to lower fund and plan costs will continue to make retirement plans more appealing to entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another incentive may be the relatively new Labor Department rule that will require anyone offering retirement plan advice to act in the best interests of employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll see more low-cost plans,'' said Mr. Hopkins of <span class="companylink">the American College of Financial Services</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- Online lenders are drawing from a familiar playbook in Washington as scrutiny of the business heats up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A central plank of their strategy is to prove that the industry can tame itself without the need for additional government intervention. By distancing themselves from payday lenders and other businesses whose predatory tactics have drawn regulatory fire, online lenders hope to avoid a similar crackdown.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The up-and-coming industry, which offers fast access to loans for consumers and small businesses, is trying to recover from a difficult summer. Renaud Laplanche, the founder of <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, one of the largest online lenders matching potential borrowers with would-be investors, resigned in May over the mishandling of some loans. Soon after that, several companies, including <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, Prosper Marketplace and Avant, announced that they were cutting jobs because of falling demand from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, consumer advocates have increased warnings that a lack of federal oversight of the lenders could leave some borrowers with unduly high fees or shut out of the market altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lenders are beginning to regroup. They have hired lobbyists, mingled at a slate of financial technology conferences and appeared eager to tell their story before lawmakers and regulators start drafting new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At a minimum, you want policy makers to understand the nuts and bolts of your business, so they give you a fair shake,'' said Brandon R. Barford, a partner at Beacon Policy Advisors, a Washington research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a group of firms and small-business experts called the Responsible Business Lending Coalition published a ''bill of rights'' for borrowers of small-business loans and other credit products. Dozens of lenders representing community development financial institutions and online companies have signed on to the agreement, which calls for clear disclosures, no hidden penalty fees and high confidence that a borrower will be able to repay the loan, among other provisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, Fundera, an online loan marketplace focused on small businesses and a founding member of the ''bill of rights'' initiative, published a special disclosure statement for telling potential borrowers about the terms of its services, including an estimated cost of paying back the loan per day, the annual percentage rate and the total cost of the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, two trade groups established this spring are preparing their own initiatives. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, Prosper and Funding Circle organized the Marketplace Lending Association in April and brought in Nat Hoopes as executive director last month. Mr. Hoopes previously served as executive director of the Financial Services Forum, a trade group representing some of the country's largest financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aim is ''to create an association in Washington that represents online lenders that are consumer-friendly and that adhere to the highest possible standards of disclosure, transparency and fair pricing,'' Mr. Hoopes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders that want to join must agree to a set of standards, which the board is ready to complete, that could influence the direction of the online lending industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposals draw a line that says members may offer loans with an annual percentage rate of up to 36 percent to consumers and businesses, but they must clearly disclose important loan terms to borrowers, and they cannot offer payday loans or merchant cash advances, a type of business loan where the company pays back the money as a percentage of future sales. Consumer advocates have criticized merchant cash advance offerings for their high rates and structure. The group is also considering opening membership to technology providers and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standards may help the members differentiate themselves from other kinds of short-term lenders that are feeling the heat from federal regulators. <span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> has taken action against a number of payday and auto title lenders in recent months, often for providing inadequate or misleading information to borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online lenders are watching regulatory activity closely. The consumer protection agency released a proposal in June that would make major changes to the payday loan market and apply tougher restrictions on installment lenders offering loans above an annual rate of 36 percent -- the same rate called for in the new membership standards. That 36 percent figure is also in line with the statutory cap for loans to active-duty military personnel and some state usury laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, three of the largest small-business lenders, <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span>, Kabbage and <span class="companylink">CAN Capital</span>, started their own organization, the Innovative Lending Platform Association, in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group is focused on ''online education, advocacy and best practices,'' said Daniel Gorfine, vice president of external affairs and associate general counsel at <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span>, speaking on behalf of the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group's first initiative, along with the <span class="companylink">Association for Enterprise Opportunity</span>, has been the development of a standardized form for displaying the annual percentage rate and total cost of a loan. The form is expected to be introduced this fall and will be open for adoption by others in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorfine said the association would look into the possibility of expanding its membership in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The industry is still in its early innings, and a lot of what you're seeing is a gradual coalescing of platforms, those that are focused on responsible innovation and the articulation of clear standards and best practices,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics argue that industry standards are not sufficient for stopping bad actors. For example, before the financial crisis, the mortgage securitization industry largely policed its own behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before the occurrence of the most predatory, usurious period in the history of mortgage lending, what we had was the best practice standard,'' said John Taylor, president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. ''And the second somebody began to operate outside of those best practices and didn't have a legal obligation not to do so was the second everybody followed those mortgage companies, those subprime predatory lenders, into that abyss, because there was no stopping them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for the lenders will be finding common ground in what has become a diverse market. Debates over how loans should be structured and disclosed are just getting started, and tensions are likely to arise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each one of these business models is ultimately going to be pushing for what's best for them,'' said Edward Mills, a policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ''If another part of the industry has to take pain, that's O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, representatives for both of the new lending groups said they were optimistic about their efforts to educate Congress and regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorfine of <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> said traditional banks had reduced small-business lending, especially after the financial crisis, and new lenders had stepped in to help fill that gap. Small-business lending has typically been subject to less federal oversight than consumer loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When policy makers hear how we're able to solve the policy challenge while giving small businesses really efficient access to capital so they can go about hiring and growing their businesses and managing their businesses on a day-to-day basis -- it's a very powerful story and a very bipartisan story,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representing <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and others, Mr. Hoopes emphasized the potential savings to borrowers. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> reports on its site, for example, that borrowers can cut their rates by a third on average if they pay off their credit balance or consolidate debt using the service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I think has been missing in some of the negative news over the summer is the value proposition that these companies bring,'' he said. ''They're saving borrowers lots of money, they're helping people pay down debt and they're providing opportunities to expand access to credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 24, 2016, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the online lending industry's efforts to shape standards for itself, partly to stave off federal regulators, described the business of one online company, Fundera, incorrectly. It is a loan marketplace that connects borrowers with online lenders; it does not underwrite or make loans itself.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DALLAS -- ''Do you enjoy risk?'' I asked T. Boone Pickens Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one level, this was the silliest of questions. Mr. Pickens, after all, is a man who abruptly quit his corporate job at 25, with $1,500 in the bank, to start his own company, which he called <span class="companylink">Mesa Petroleum</span>. He spent the next four decades poking holes in the ground, searching for oil and natural gas -- without question one of the activities with the highest risk in all of business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s, he famously made a series of audacious takeover attempts aimed at companies -- <span class="companylink">Gulf Oil</span>, Phillips, Unocal -- that were 10, 20, 30 times the size of Mesa. For years he covered his company's general overhead budget by playing the commodities market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, he bet big, and bet wrong, on the price of natural gas. That, and a lengthy bout with depression, which was undiagnosed for years, caused him to lose his company in 1996 at the age of 67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than retire, Mr. Pickens decided to start a hedge fund to trade commodities, primarily natural gas futures. In the of 1997, he raised $37 million -- $8 million of which was his money. By early 1999, however, the fund had lost more than 90 percent, and was under $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the end of 2000, with his depression lifted and his faith in his own judgment restored, the fund was up to $252 million, a gain of more than 9,000 percent. By 2008, he was worth $3 billion, according to Forbes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So yes, it's pretty obvious that T. Boone Pickens enjoys risk. But as it turns out, that's not the whole answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've known Mr. Pickens for more than three decades, ever since I was working for Texas Monthly and wrote about his first takeover attempt in 1982. Over the years, we've stayed in touch, and I've written about him or quoted him any number of times, including in several of my old ''Talking Business'' columns for The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though I've always known about his adventures as a commodities trader, I realized recently that I had never talked to him about risk -- about how he thinks about it, and why his tolerance for it is so high. And whether ordinary investors can learn something from the way he invests, just as they do when they pay attention to Warren Buffett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus it was that on a recent morning in Dallas, I found myself in a large conference room in the offices of Mr. Pickens's investment firm, BP Capital. One wall was dominated by a large screen -- as big as anything you'd see on Wall Street, blinking instantaneous prices for crude oil, natural gas, some energy-related stocks (BP Capital also now manages an energy stock fund) and a handful of other things Mr. Pickens likes to keep track of. CNBC and Fox News were on but muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pickens's wealth has dropped to $500 million, in no small part because he had chosen to give much of it away. At 88, his most serious physical problem is his hearing. As he sat down, he pulled out a small amplification device and placed it on the table. Even so, he often had to ask the others in the room -- there were five of us -- to repeat things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is not the same as saying he didn't ultimately understand what was being said. He has always had a voracious appetite for information, and he is the unquestioned decision-maker at BP Capital. His team's role, in no small part, is to help supply the information he needs to make decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All year long, Mr. Pickens's funds -- there are now a half-dozen, managing around $1 billion -- had been ''long'' on oil, meaning that they had been betting that the price, which is currently in the mid-$40 range, was going to rise. Less than two years ago, the price of oil was as high as $120 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the price dropped, big, expensive exploration projects had been canceled, and the number of wells being drilled had dropped sharply. Pickens's thesis was that this drop in supply was bound to make demand tight -- which, in turn, would cause the price of oil to rise. He had put on his long position eight months early, and was completely unruffled by the market's daily ups and downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is one thing that you quickly learn about him as an investor. As he puts it, ''We're not traders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he has looked at all the available information, studied the fundamentals and believes his thesis is still right, he'll stick with it even if the price isn't going in his direction. If he believes strongly enough, he'll use the drop in price as a buying opportunity. That is one of those attributes that separates great investors -- Mr. Buffett does the same thing -- from the rest of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the information itself. I saw Mr. Pickens speak a few months ago in Texas and was thunderstruck at how much information about the current state of the oil and gas industry he had at his fingertips. In the conference room at BP Capital, I got a strong sense of how that information is accumulated and used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They talked about when the weather was supposed to turn cold, which generally pushes natural gas prices higher, and why <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span>'s stock had been rising lately. They dissected a few of the big exploration projects that had been canceled. One member of the Pickens team put up some charts showing vehicle miles driven against the price of gasoline. ''Does a 10 percent rise in price impact demand?'' he said. ''So far, the answer has been no.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing supply coming down,'' someone else said. ''That was predictable,'' replied Mr. Pickens, ''because there aren't any rigs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there were the Saudis and the other oil-producing nations. An important part of Pickens's investing thesis is that <span class="companylink">OPEC</span>, led by the Saudis, was going to have to lower production to get the price higher. Over and over again, they reviewed the logic: The oil-producing countries needed higher oil prices to fund their societies; they just couldn't keep letting oil drop. Saudi debt had gone from $40 billion to $280 billion, someone said. ''It's killing them,'' Mr. Pickens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we do is check, check, check,'' he told me when the meeting had ended. ''You are always checking to see if you have screwed up on your conclusions. The market doesn't believe the Saudis will cut oil production to get the price up, and I can't believe they haven't done it so far. We'll see by the end of the year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, he had no intention of changing his position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Boone is an educated risk-taker,'' said Michael Ross, who until 2010 was Mr. Pickens's primary futures trader. ''He takes a position and if it goes against him, he'll start asking questions. And if he still thinks he's right, he'll double up. He bets on himself. When you have conviction, you can withstand risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gathering information, holding firm even if the market is going against you, these are things that the rest of us can do if we put our minds to it. But it's the size of the risk Mr. Pickens takes -- the willingness to bet it all if he thinks he's right -- that most investors will never be able to do. Risk has been a part of Mr. Pickens's business life for so long, it barely causes him to blink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus came his answer to my original question. ''Do you enjoy risk?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He thought for a minute and then chuckled. ''I guess so,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armchair venture capitalists will soon have a new place to hunt for intriguing start-ups: <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span>, the popular crowdfunding site for developers of creative ventures like movies, games and gadgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting on Tuesday, the site will give entrepreneurs the option of offering backers an equity stake in their projects and creations. <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> is the first major crowdfunding site to use a new securities rule that took effect six months ago, allowing ordinary investors to risk up to a few thousands dollars a year backing private companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, only accredited investors -- wealthy people with an annual income of more than $200,000 or a net worth of at least $1 million -- were allowed to put money into such risky ventures. That created a schism: Companies like Pebble, a smartwatch maker, and Oculus, a virtual reality headset developer, raised millions on crowdfunding sites from eager early customers and used that surge to prove that buyers wanted their fledgling products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when those companies subsequently raised money from investors, crowdfunding backers were shut out. When <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> acquired Oculus for $2 billion, venture capitalists and rich angel investors reaped the rewards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a lot of ways, this levels the playing field,'' said David Mandelbrot, <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span>'s chief executive. ''This was one of the few areas of the law where citizens were treated differently based on the amount of wealth that they have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Securities law had long prohibited regular investors from gambling on private companies because they can be risky investments that are likely to go bad. Half of American small businesses with employees shut down within five years, and those that survive often take many years to turn a profit. Things have not been looking so hot for Pebble, for example, which recently laid off a quarter of its staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some entrepreneurs are eager to test out the new market. ArtCraft Entertainment, a video game developer in Austin, is considering an <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> campaign to find investors for Crowfall, a game it plans to release next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowfall already took in nearly $1.8 million from a Kickstarter campaign last year. For that, the company offered traditional crowdfunding perks like early access to the game's beta tests and a thank you in Crowfall's credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 33,000 backers have kicked in money for Crowfall's development, and ArtCraft -- which has also raised money from traditional early-stage investors -- likes the idea of offering them a stake in the game's financial outcome, said J. Todd Coleman, the company's creative director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company considered an offering in May, when equity crowdfunding became legal, but backed off because of concerns about whether it could draw interest, Mr. Coleman said. Selling stakes to small investors is a strictly regulated process, and all offerings must be run through portals registered with the <span class="companylink">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</span>. <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> is partnering with MicroVentures, a registered portal that will handle the back-end investment logistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 20 portals have become certified and started courting investors, but interest has been scant. Only 55 companies have run successful equity crowdfunding campaigns, raising a total of $12.4 million, according to statistics compiled by the investment portal Wefunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> could shake up the field by bringing investment opportunities to a much wider audience. Some eight million people have backed projects on the site, raising more than $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> called us, that flipped the equation,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''It changed the math from 'this isn't something we feel comfortable risking,' to 'let's try it!' We have some very, very passionate fans, and we think it would be cool to let them have the opportunity to invest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most crowdfunding investors gamble tiny sums. About a third of the investments made on Wefunder so far are for $100, the site's minimum, and 76 percent are for $500 or less, according to Nick Tommarello, Wefunder's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike shares in public companies, which can be easily sold if an investor wants out, stock in private ventures is largely illiquid. Investors who snap up a stake in a start-up they spot on <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> are most likely stuck with it for many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the process is more complex and expensive than traditional crowdfunding. It costs nothing to start a regular campaign on <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span>. The site takes a 5 percent cut of the funds raised. The people who donate typically get an early version product in question, plus various trinkets or karmic rewards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for equity campaigns, creators will need to spend about $7,000 on compliance and regulatory costs, <span class="companylink">Indiegogo</span> estimates, before a campaign is permitted to go live. The site will then take a cash fee of 7 percent on any funds raised, plus an additional 2 percent in stock. Investors will pay a $7 processing fee or 2 percent of their investment, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-known and most active site for crowdfunding projects, Kickstarter, says it is not interested in the equity market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The purpose of creativity is not to become an investment vehicle,'' said Justin Kazmark, a Kickstarter spokesman. ''When creative projects escape the need to generate profit, the result is a more vibrant and diverse culture. We're more focused on a richer culture than richer investors.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Delaware court decision to require the sale of TransPerfect, the big, profitable language translation company, has employees howling. They fear their employer will be pushed into the hands of a private equity buyer who would cut jobs. But the real fault lies with the owners who seem to be acting like spoiled children, wreaking havoc on the company they founded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Elizabeth Elting and Philip R. Shawe founded TransPerfect in their dorm room when they lived together while attending <span class="companylink">New York University</span>'s business school more than two decades ago. The company is owned 50 percent by Ms. Elting and 49 percent by Mr. Shawe. One percent of the company is held by Mr. Shawe's mother to qualify the business as a majority female-owned business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1992 the company has blossomed and is now probably worth more than $1 billion. TransPerfect has more than 3,500 full-time employees, and annual revenue has reached nearly $500 million. The company, which is based in New York, has become a leading provider of translation services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While TransPerfect has flourished, the relationship between Ms. Elting and Mr. Shawe has worsened, as is detailed in the Delaware court's decision. They were briefly engaged in 1996, but Ms. Elting broke it off the next year. According to Ms. Elting, Mr. Shawe showed a pattern of terrorizing behavior toward the man she eventually married, the court said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Elting and Mr. Shawe stayed with the company as co-chief executives and co-owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is where it got complicated. They never did the most basic thing entrepreneurs do when they form a company -- draft an agreement that details how decisions would be made and what would happen if there was no agreement. In the latter case, there is typically a buy-sell, a mechanism that allows either party to exit by offering to sell his or her shares to the other at a set price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Elting and Mr. Shawe's failure to do this most basic thing would haunt them through this day and lead to litigation in multiple states. Without an agreement on how to run the company, the two were deadlocked. Mr. Shawe's mother voted with him, not surprisingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Sartre mantra that ''hell is other people'' clearly applies to TransPerfect. The two tried to arrange a working peace by governing separate divisions, but as the court opinion describes, there were ''temper tantrums'' and ''mutual hostaging'' by Ms. Elting and Mr. Shawe, where each would hold things up that the other wanted unless he or she got certain things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, when Ms. Elting questioned plans to open an office in Montpellier, France, Mr. Shawe sent a number of emails threatening to dismantle the company. ''FOR YOU TO MAKE ME GO NUCLEAR OVER A $20k office decision is not one you should take lightly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You get the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012 things got worse. According to the opinion by Chancellor Andre G. Bouchard of the Court of Chancery, Ms. Elting and Mr. Shawe would make decisions for the business but the other would then refuse to allow the decision to proceed unless he or she got something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Elting hired lawyers to advise her, and Mr. Shawe secretly hacked her emails to read them. The court has sanctioned him for it. The bickering escalated. In 2014, after an argument in the office. Mr. Shawe filed a complaint with the police against Ms. Elting accusing her of battery and describing her as his former fiancée, something that would ensure an arrest. The charges were dropped, but Mr. Shawe filed a tort case that continues, according to the court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court said employees made a ''mass exodus'' because of the ''crazy arbitrary stuff'' occurring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all the disputes, litigation was inevitable. The strategy of each party appears to be to buy out the other. But in Delaware, where TransPerfect is incorporated, there is a special provision of the law to appoint a custodian of the business if there is deadlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chancellor Bouchard found that the deadlock in the case met that standard. But he also found that the ''complete and utter dysfunction'' should not justify keeping the parties in place with the business run by a custodian. This would require Ms. Elting, the most likely seller, to sell her shares at a discount since he said, ''What rational person would want to step into Elting's shoes to partner with someone willing to 'cause constant pain' and 'go the distance' to get his way?'' Moreover, appointing a tiebreaker director would be inappropriate because both parties were relatively young.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, Chancellor Bouchard ordered the company sold and the proceeds split among the partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction has been heated. Mr. Shawe has appealed. A group of TransPerfect employees that says it represents both the Shawe and Elting forces also has started a campaign to get the decision overturned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employees have formed ''Citizens for Pro-Business Delaware'' arguing that the decision is unprecedented because TransPerfect is a very profitable and successful business and that a sale would cause turmoil. Chris Coffey, the leader of the group, predicted that half the employees would be fired if a private equity firm took over. But change is difficult, and the business may or may not prosper under a new owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group has also submitted op-eds to newspapers and proposed an amendment to Delaware law. One employee has sued Chancellor Bouchard in New York federal court claiming the decision silenced his right to speak against the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Citizens for Pro-Business Delaware is trying to frame this as an issue of a court interfering with a business, and has even persuaded Rudolph W. Giuliani to side with it. The group has clearly gotten under the skin of the Delaware judges. Vice Chancellor Travis Laster, also of the Delaware Chancery Court, wrote, it is ''an utter fabrication and ridiculous claim.'' He added, ''what you have here is someone attempting, outside the judicial process, to influence what's supposed to be a disinterested court proceeding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's be real. The founders decided to incorporate in Delaware, and judge here is applying the law. Given the childish behavior of both sides, he is on good grounds. It seems highly unlikely that the higher court will overturn this. The legal fees would be much better spent counseling traumatized employees or going to charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founders chose to not settle their arrangements upfront and then bullied each other and employees in a vicious power struggle. I like to say in my classroom that a business is like a marriage where you pre-order your arrangements through a prenuptial agreement. This is one that has become an ugly divorce where it's not about me winning but you losing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aggrieved employees of TransPerfect should not blame the judge but instead the founders who seem to have succeeded despite themselves. It is really their fault and a problem they can easily fix by behaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a lesson here for others, too. Remember that like a marriage, get your affairs in order when you start a business, or you might pay.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the competitive start-up world, even the shrewdest entrepreneurs -- with the latest and greatest gadgets -- can find themselves thrown unexpectedly into legal quagmires that could derail or blow up a dream before it gets off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes it's a simple oversight. Other times, a fresh-faced business owner tries to save a few dollars by ignoring such issues as liability, patents, copyright and taxes. But many of these business-killers are not only foreseeable, but preventable as well, experts say. And several who have paid heed have avoided potential business land mines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Josh York, a 33-year-old fitness buff, decided to create a mobile personal training company, called GymGuyz, in 2008, he knew he would need insurance. His company, based in Plainview, N.Y., offers a ''gym on wheels'': a personal trainer loads up a van with more than 300 pieces of fitness equipment -- like dumbbells and resistance bands -- and travels to a client's home, workplace, school or park to give a personal workout session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't start training anyone until I had the insurance,'' said Mr. York, who has a bachelor's degree in business administration from the C. W. Post campus of <span class="companylink">Long Island University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting insurers on board wasn't easy. He contacted five companies before finding one that would sign him on. Mr. York had to demonstrate that he could strap down the equipment in the van to reduce the risk of road accidents and that his certification as a personal trainer reduced the chance that clients would be injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, he tried to save money by not insuring his equipment, thinking that it would be safe while locked in a van. Nevertheless, after one van was vandalized in 2014, he started insuring the equipment as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance to cover liabilities is often an afterthought for many start-ups, but it should often be at the top of the list. A manufacturing defect, an injury to an employee or customer, or even a hacker breach of a payment system or website could lead to a lawsuit and kill a budding start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes a lot of start-ups don't want to hear about the coverages because they think it will cost them money,'' said Melnora Cruz, a vice president at MOC Insurance Services, based in San Francisco. But they cannot afford not to protect themselves, she said: ''They could have a claim that costs $1 million and could put them in bankruptcy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other legal issues can also trip up companies. Mr. York, for instance, got a trademark on his logo right away and bought both spellings of the domain name -- GymGuyz and GymGuys -- to protect himself from copycats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People laughed at me and told me I was crazy,'' Mr. York said. ''They said, 'Why would you do that?'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undaunted by the skeptics, Mr. York pushed ahead. His company will have franchises in 100 markets in 18 states by year-end, up from one location eight years ago. Its revenue, which totaled $101,000 in 2008, is on track to reach $5.5 million this year from the company-owned business and franchise fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Sky</span> Zone, an indoor trampoline park operator based in Los Angeles, also faced a skeptical reception when it tried to obtain insurance in 2004. The company owns the patent on the ''trampoline court,'' a web of trampolines that are interconnected, allowing jumpers to move among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When would-be underwriters heard the word trampoline, many conjured up visions of 1960s-style backyard trampolines, where reports were rampant of people tumbling off and being rushed to hospitals with broken bones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went to six to 10 insurers'' before finding one that would provide coverage, said Jeff Platt, chief executive of Sky Zone. It took considerable time to educate insurance brokers about the netting, safety guards, rules and monitoring staff before he could convince a company that the injury risk at his parks was low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only way to fall off of our trampolines would be to climb up a trampoline wall, then climb up about seven feet of netting and then literally jump over it,'' Mr. Platt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Platt said he was constantly learning about new liabilities and addressing them. In 2012, he installed cameras inside and outside the parks after a break-in. In 2014, <span class="companylink">Sky</span> Zone faced a security breach of one park's pay systems, where a small number of credit card numbers were stolen. Mr. Platt quickly brought in security experts to fix the breach and monitor the systems at all the parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His vigilance has paid off. <span class="companylink">Sky</span> Zone owns four parks and holds franchises in 175 locations in six countries. Its revenue, which stood at $800,000 in its first full year in 2005, rose to $54.1 million from company-owned parks and franchise fees in 2015. It is on track to reach $60.1 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One start-up, Dolly, brought on an insurance broker and legal counsel as investors to help the company address liability and regulatory issues. Dolly's Uber-like mobile app connects people who want to move furniture or other items with people who own trucks, vans or large sport utility vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Howell, 38, a Seattle resident with a degree from the <span class="companylink">London School of Economics</span>, is a co-founder of Dolly, which began in 2014. He said insurers were initially reluctant to sign on, fearing that the risk of damage or injury would be high for a business that relied on someone with no moving expertise to transport furniture and other items from one location to another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Howell said underwriters misunderstood the business. Dolly is aimed at consumers who want a fast, cheap and easy way to move a small number of items from one apartment or store to another. It is not competing with moving companies that deal with the entire contents of a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most moves involve fewer than five items and cost an average of $80. Dolly picks up a 15 percent to 25 percent commission on each move. Damage has been reported in fewer than 1 percent of the 100,000 moves Dolly has done, according to Mr. Howell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We now have an investor who's a big-time insurance broker'' and advises the company on insurance matters, Mr. Howell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly has raised about $10 million in financing, with Jeffrey A. Wilke, chief executive of Amazon's worldwide consumer unit, among the investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patent, ownership and copyright issues could also sink a company if not addressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cash-short entrepreneurs opt to skip the search for patents and trademarks to save money -- and that's a mistake, warned Allan H. Cohen, managing partner at <span class="companylink">Nixon Peabody</span>'s Long Island law office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recalled one client who built a health care app, adopted a name, and then spent tens of thousands of dollars developing a logo, website and marketing materials using that name. However, when a trademark search was later conducted, the company discovered that the name was already being used by a small firm in another state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The client, however, did not want to change the name, and is now gambling that the company will not be sued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But company owners who want to be a huge success should pay heed, Mr. Cohen said. ''They could get a cease-and-desist order and have to stop using the name or be sued,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes are also often overlooked out of concern over costs -- but some tax provisions can actually be beneficial. Some programs, such as the angel investor tax credit available in some states, can make raising money easier. And the federal research and development tax credit can save money on a start-up's tax returns, said Mitchell Kopelman, a certified public accountant and a partner at HA&amp;W, a business advisory firm in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these crucial issues should be addressed early and re-examined as a company grows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even today we learn about new liabilities with our business,'' said Mr. Platt of <span class="companylink">Sky</span> Zone. ''Risk management doesn't end; it is an ongoing process that is living and breathing every single day.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- In the classic science fiction series that began with ''Ender's Game,'' the character Jane begins by using her artificial intelligence to prepare taxes for the hero Ender, but soon takes over management of his entire financial life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to otherworldly science fiction personalities, Jane is a rather prosaic figure, but Ethan Bloch had her in mind when he began his start-up Digit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloch's company currently creates free automated savings accounts -- and has helped customers put aside over $250 million -- but his vision is to add capabilities until Digit becomes a full-service financial assistant like Jane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone needs a Jane,'' Mr. Bloch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is now a lot of competition to create an automated financial assistant for the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> and Mint, two popular financial applications with many millions more users than Digit, are about to roll out suites of new features that will make them feel more like robotic financial advisers, tapping customers on the shoulder when they could make better financial decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One feature that both <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> and Mint will offer is more automated tax preparation of the sort that Jane provided for Ender (though with much less robotic charm and thoroughness).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of newer start-ups have recently begun with similar ambitions and even more advanced capabilities than existing players. The new app Albert from Albert Corporation, which announced $2.5 million in seed funding last month, provides a personalized savings account as Digit does, but it can also look at existing car insurance policies and credit cards and ferret out better deals. Banks are racing to keep up with their own digital capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-ups and the banks are still far from delivering on the promise of a digital assistant that actually takes care of your financial problems for you. <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> and Mint still require you to enter many of your own details. But all the players in the field are working with machine learning and artificial intelligence that will increasingly provide proactive analysis and advice rather than forcing someone to constantly check in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are betting that in the continuing transformation of finance by technology, the financial assistant category will be one of the most lucrative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is lots of opportunity here,'' said Charles Birnbaum, an investor at the venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Bessemer Venture Partners</span>, who recently put money into Albert. ''This is an opportunity that Mint and the banks should have done for people already -- made it really easy to have a good sense for what you should be doing with your money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new personal financial advisers are taking a different tack compared with big-name financial technology start-ups like <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Square, which provide actual financial services: arranging loans and processing payments. <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> and its competitors are betting that there is more value in being the neutral intermediary that helps customers find financial services and keep track of their various accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of this business model compare the opportunity to the one that <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> spotted in media, where they serve as so-called platforms for other media companies rather than being media companies themselves. This approach allowed them to become the primary point of contact with the customer, a very profitable and powerful place to sit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By being Switzerland, and being neutral, in the same way that <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> are, we are finding the best products,'' said Nikhyl Singhal, a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who joined <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> as the chief product officer last year. ''We don't have the conflict where we are trying to sell our own product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> in particular has been demonstrating how lucrative this can be by charging lenders and credit card companies for every customer it passes along. While the company does not say how much it charges, industry insiders say that <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> generally makes $100 to $700 for every customer who signs up for a credit card, a significant chunk of the revenue that the credit card company will make in the first year. <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> said it pulled in around $350 million of revenue last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business model creates the potential for conflicts of interest if an intermediary like <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> sends customers to a credit card company or lender that pays the biggest referral fee rather than the one that offers the best deal for the customer. But the companies are all adamant that they will succeed only if they are known for doing what is best for the customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> now has 60 million account holders, 20 million of whom check in every month -- about 10 times as many as its biggest rival, Mint, and nearly as many as some of the nation's largest banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in San Francisco in 2007, <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> has been known for the niche service of providing customers with free access to credit scores, and advice on how to improve them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, though, the company has been using its large pile of cash from venture capitalists to buy and build new features for customers, including one function that searches for unclaimed property for all of its customers and another that can identify and dispute credit report errors through the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the company is announcing its acquisition of a tax software company, OnePriceTaxes, that has been integrated into <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> to allow free state and federal tax filings for every customer on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ken Lin, the founder and chief executive of the site, said that once <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> had access to a customer's tax filings it would have a much more detailed picture of that person's finances and could turn that into new layers of financial advice -- by identifying, for instance, ways to invest money with more tax efficiency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, the best-known financial website is still Mint, which gained renown by allowing customers to track all their varied financial accounts in one place. It too makes money by pointing customers to outside financial products that pay Mint for each referral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lin and others in the industry said that Mint, which is now owned by <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, struggled to maintain its early growth because it required too much work from its customers, who have to categorize their transactions and do not get much in return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Al Ko, who became Mint's general manager last year, acknowledges that most Americans are not willing to do the work to keep track of their finances in Mint. As a result, he has led a rebuilding of Mint so that it will do more of the work for customers, and make active recommendations rather than just serve as a place to keep track of a budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first big step in Mint's expansion is the announcement this week of a dashboard that will monitor bills and remind customers when they are coming due, with increasingly urgent notifications as the date nears. Mint is also making it possible for customers to make payments directly through it, rather than a credit card site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko said that 6 percent of Mint customers failed to make even the minimum payment on their credit cards each month, a lapse that can lead to big fees and damaged credit scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mint and another <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> division, TurboTax, are also being integrated so that tax forms from banks and credit cards will be automatically fed into customers' tax filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I envision Mint being as ubiquitous as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>,'' Mr. Ko said. ''This thing that helps me make better decisions and never forgets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks, of course, are not happy to see companies like Mint come between them and their customers. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> recently announced that it was working on its own artificial-intelligence-powered financial assistant, Erica, but it will not be out until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other new start-ups that offer some financial services want to expand to become the primary financial dashboard for customers. The so-called robo-advisers, like Betterment and Personal Capital, already have more details about their customers than <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span> or Mint, and are building out competing features. But these companies have been slow to grow at the pace of <span class="companylink">Credit Karma</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digit, the company inspired by Jane, has been rapidly picking up customers, and venture capital money. Now it needs to begin adding features to come closer to the original vision out of science fiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ender was a guy who saved the human race but didn't have time to do his own taxes,'' Mr. Bloch said. ''If you want people to have financial health, you need to do it for them.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDSAN DIEGO -- For decades, politicians lobbied to bring military bases to their districts for one reason: jobs. A base is akin to a corporate headquarters, bringing with it jobs in related businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, the high concentration of military bases has turned the region into a growing entrepreneurial hub for veterans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 229,000 military veterans live in San Diego. The 100-mile radius supports more military and Coast Guard personnel than any other metropolitan area in the country, according to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of San Diego's veterans start companies that function as contractors and suppliers to the military because of their contacts and security clearances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sumner Lee, a former Navy helicopter pilot who also spent several years working for the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, or Spawar, in San Diego, leveraged his experience to help start Fuse Integration in 2010. Fuse, a design engineering firm, focuses on networks and software. Its software tool allows the Navy to monitor network systems on its ships, Mr. Lee said. Revenue, which he said is under $10 million, grew 35 percent in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to research from the <span class="companylink">United States Small Business Administration</span>, veterans are 45 percent more likely to be self-employed than those without active-duty military experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego's start-up community has grown exponentially over the past 15 years, and veterans have found homes within it, said Mark Cafferty, the chief executive of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation. The region has more than 25 incubators and accelerators for start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look across all sectors of San Diego's economy -- life sciences, telecom, biotech, health care, I.T., sports innovation, medical and wearable devices, clean tech -- you will find entrepreneurial hubs,'' Mr. Cafferty said. ''Over time, growth has transformed our region's economy into a diverse mix of high-growth industries, some with direct ties to defense technology. This can be largely attributed to the veterans who stay here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet veterans still face some daunting challenges in transitioning from the military to private-sector entrepreneurship. To address those issues, several groups have set out to help veterans navigate the complexities of starting a small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest hurdles is access to capital, said Carlos E. Figari, director of the SoCal Veterans Business Outreach Center in Carlsbad, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're starting a brand-new business and you don't have any type of business track record because you've been serving in the military, it's very hard to get a loan or find investors,'' he said. ''If you are starting a company that's directly connected to the experience obtained while you were in the military, then you have a network to tap. But if you want to open a Subway, that's a totally different story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veterans who aspire to be entrepreneurs often lack solid knowledge of the industry in which they want to operate, Mr. Figari said. Some, he added, may struggle to understand that as business owners, they will have several jobs, not one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address those challenges, nonprofit groups and former service members have created programs to give veterans the training they need. Mr. Figari's group, for instance, provides general entrepreneurship training to veterans in eight counties in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other groups offer more extensive training, like the Rosie Network, a nonprofit that helps small businesses in San Diego started by veterans or their spouses. This year, the Rosie Network opened the Military Entrepreneur Development Center, an accelerator program for entrepreneurs who are on active duty, are veterans or are spouses of military personnel. It also offers Service2CEO, a free, 12-month small-business development program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Norris, a former member of the Navy SEALs, went through the Rosie Network's training after leaving the military in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His experience in the Navy led him to help found Predator Warpaint, a camouflage paint with sunscreen protection. The SEALs, along with members of other military branches, train outdoors using camouflage face paint, but military-issued sunscreen ''is a rarity,'' Mr. Norris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predator Warpaint adopted technology often used in the surfing industry -- a sport that defines San Diego's beach culture -- and created a camouflage paint that contains SPF 50 sunscreen. The Rosie Network, Mr. Norris said, helped his company make critical connections for building sales channels to the military and to hunters, who buy it online. A Kickstarter campaign raised $30,000 in seed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than finding investors or securing a loan, Isaac Wang, a former surface warfare officer in the Navy, chose to finance his start-up, War Foodie, which sells specialty coffee and coffee presses, himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspiration for it came from his experience in the Navy. ''The coffee is really bad,'' Mr. Wang said. His company, now two years old, sells its wares in both military and expat communities globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those leaving the service, however, may not know if they are suited to run their own businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Honor Foundation helps veterans address that question in its 15-week program, which trains and prepares former Navy SEALs to either start their own companies or to get a job. One-third of the Honor Foundation's graduates trained as entrepreneurs, said Joe Musselman, the organization's founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them is Charles Matranga, who finished the program in June. Mr. Matranga was a member of the Navy SEALs for 26 years. During that time, he handled a host of business issues, including managing budgets, people and capital. Now, he said he is ''translating those skills into corporate America skills.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year he helped start Exitus Technologies, which makes a wearable security device that can connect its user to a network of friends and emergency medical workers with the push of a button.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of San Diego's ex-military personnel have found a home in the tech sector, which also dominates the region with companies like <span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span>, Sapphire Energy and General Atomics. These kinds of technology ventures need engineers, especially electrical, aerospace and communication engineers, who are plentiful in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a good talent pool for us,'' said Josh Wells, a former Navy pilot and a founder and chief executive of Planck Aerosystems, which created a technology that enables unmanned drones to take off and land autonomously from a moving vehicle onto a ship. So far, Planck has raised $1.9 million in seed funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan McAfee spent seven years as a Navy corpsman before being discharged in 2007 because of an injury. Mr. McAfee learned about Fab Lab, a nonprofit community space in San Diego's Makers Quarter that gives members access to tools, technology and training for digital fabrication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, he created an entrepreneur-in-residence program in which participants collaborate and support one another. In exchange, they volunteer at least five hours per week at the lab. About 20 percent of Fab Lab members are active-duty military or veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is something interesting about the intersection of the maker movement and the veteran population,'' said Katie Rast, a founder and the director of Fab Lab. ''I think there is a call to action that really speaks to those who have served, knowing you have been the creator of something that has use in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was at Fab Lab that Mr. McAfee got to know the founders of Robo3D, a 3-D printing company. He then joined the company about 18 months ago as a partner and vice president of engineering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has just raised a second round of funding and is preparing for an initial public offering. ''I love working with start-ups,'' Mr. McAfee said. ''The intensity, the pace, the flexibility and how competitive it all is.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens when you throw together an entrepreneurial supermodel, a charitable crowdfunding app, lots of glittery gems and the odd paper-flower crown? David Yurman is hoping that the answer will be holiday brand-building magic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Yurman, the New York-based jewelry brand, has long cultivated a boho-chic image, and its current holiday advertising campaign, ''The Gift of Love and Light,'' features an array of influences from artsy to altruistic.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more unusual elements is a partnership with the crowdfunding app Elbi. The brainchild of Natalia Vodianova, one of the primary models in the Yurman holiday campaign, Elbi uses the principles behind social sharing to promote microdonations to various causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app's users can create small projects in support of causes, which are then up-voted by donations, a dollar at a time. Users get points they can cash in for luxury-brand rewards, such as headphones, handbags or jewelry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Yurman is donating jewelry, including one bracelet design in the brand's signature ''cable'' style, to Elbi's rewards program, as well as donating $1 per transaction that takes place on its website during December. Customers can choose from one of seven causes selected for the brand partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a way of engaging millennials in a playful way and the way they consume today and the way they use their smartphones,'' said Silvia Galfo, the chief marketing officer for David Yurman. ''You don't just give money, but you give part of your time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By nature, fine jewelry is a discretionary purchase, which means that integrating a philanthropic element has to be done with a deft touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you give yourself something, you're being generous to yourself,'' said Sybil Yurman, a co-founder of the jewelry company. ''When you're generous to yourself, it's much easier to be generous to others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shane O'Neill, vice president at the jewelry marketing agency Fruchtman Marketing, said, ''It does put a face of social awareness on David Yurman that they care about social giving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketing experts say Elbi's partnership with David Yurman could give the jewelry brand more exposure among young adults. Elbi's users, who skew about 60 percent female, are at the younger edge of Generation Y, according to the app's head of partnerships, Carly Buckingham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're looking at 16 to maybe 30 or 32 is the target age for us,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, David Yurman's core customer is roughly in the 35-to-45-year-old range, although Ms. Galfo said the brand was also making efforts to reach professional millennials. And that is part of the reason that the combination of technology and social philanthropy seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're definitely a generation that wants to effect change and wants to be in charge of the change,'' Ms. Vodianova said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Neill said: ''It gives the consumer the ability to really identify the charity of their choice, and they do identify that with the brand. Because there are so many charities out there, so many different types of things people connect with that are important to them, from a social standpoint, I definitely think it gives a richer experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elbi partnership is paired with a digital, print and social campaign, featuring photography and six videos, which include Ms. Vodianova and were shot by Bruce Weber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign includes print ads running in newspapers and magazines, as well as a special catalog insert. The videos are running in movie theaters and on the brand's social channels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People look at jewelry and, most of the time, it's in a case and you can't touch it,'' Mr. Weber said. ''I really tried to make the jewelry touchable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weber said he had taken inspiration from old home movies. The stories depicted in the campaign evoke old-school vacation activities: painting with watercolors, dancing in the grass, lounging in a rowboat, making costumes out of paper for a backyard performance -- with both children and adults adorned with the brand's jewelry. The overall effect is a sort of haute whimsy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign's focus on family and togetherness connects back to the emphasis on children's causes in the brand's partnership with Elbi, Ms. Galfo said. ''Family is good,'' she said. ''It's the human family, especially at the holidays.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weber said his goal was capturing the free-spirited conviviality that took place on-set. ''Sybil and David had a really bohemian background when they started,'' he said. When the photography and filming took place, he added, ''we were kind of like a bunch of friends.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reminding customers that there are unique people and personalities behind the brand is important to capturing younger consumers, marketing experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's one of the aspects people want when it comes to a luxury brand,'' said Pam Danziger, president of Unity Marketing, which focuses on the luxury market. ''What I'm seeing with young people and young affluents is craving for the real, authentic story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yurman added, ''It's really important for us that people know we exist and we're alive and we're real people.''</p>
