But with the economy still struggling and new regulations meant to eliminate bad lending, bank loans continue to lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The days of yesteryear when you could go to your corner bank are over,'' said Kenneth Walsleben, who teaches in the entrepreneurship and emerging enterprises department at the Whitman School of Management at <span class="companylink">Syracuse University</span>. ''Small, emerging, growing businesses have few traditional sources to turn to. You have to get a little creative.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some creative alternatives have been around forever; others emerged during the crisis. Almost all are substantially more expensive than traditional bank loans, which is why they have been sources of last resort. But as demand for alternative options has increased, some prices have come down. This guide, based on conversations with lenders, brokers and business owners, suggests which products make the most sense for different types of businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asset-Based Lending</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS Companies sell their receivables, or invoices, to a factoring company, which gives the companies 80 to 90 percent of the value upfront and the rest when the invoices are paid off. Some lenders offer loans based on a company's purchase orders, contracts or inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO USES IT Business-to-business companies that cannot wait for payment and especially troubled companies, because an invoice factor depends on the client's ability to pay, not the borrower's solvency. Purchase-order, contract and inventory loans require more creditworthiness from the borrower. ''If you're in the office supplies business and you get an order from Staples, you can use purchase-order financing, and it can level the playing field,'' said Neil Seiden, managing director of Asset Enhancement Solutions, a financial adviser in Port Washington, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Purchase-order financing costs 4 to 5 percent monthly; factorers usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 18 to 30 percent, said Mr. Walsleben, who is also a co-owner of the Hamilton Group, a factoring company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUPPLIERS Liquid Capital, the Interface Financial Group, Triton Business Solutions, Simplified Leasing, Rosenthal &amp; Rosenthal and scores of other firms offer factoring and other asset-based lending services. Many are members of the <span class="companylink">International Factoring Association</span> trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lease-Back</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS A company sells its real estate or equipment for cash and simultaneously leases it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO USES IT Healthy companies with warehouses, manufacturing locations or other properties that hold value that could be put to use elsewhere. The borrower sells at market value, usually the average of several appraisals, and leases the property back at the market rate for 10 to 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST The lease-back adds a monthly lease payment where previously there was none. Companies get less value from equipment than real estate because, unlike real estate, equipment depreciates over time, and lenders tend to value it at what is known as forced liquidation value, a lowball price based on what it would fetch at auction. Equipment lease-backs can create tax burdens as well. ''If I own a press outright for 10 years and it's worth $1 million, but it's on the books for $250,000, and I sell it for $1 million, I'll have to pay tax on a gain of $750,000,'' Mr. Walsleben said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash Advances</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS A business receives a lump sum from a lender, which then takes a percentage of the business's daily card receipts until the loan, plus a predetermined fee, is paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO USES IT Restaurants and other retailers. Business-to-consumer companies generally have more limited financing options because they do not have wholesale invoices to factor or factories to borrow against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Twenty percent and up, but highly variable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLE When he needed money last year to cover utilities and taxes during the slow winter months, Dennis Sick, owner of the Mohegan Manor restaurant in Baldwinsville, N.Y., took out a $45,000 advance on credit card receipts. The lender said he would take 13 to 18 percent of Mr. Sick's daily credit card sales until he had received $64,000, which would take 12 to 15 months and give him an annual rate of 60 to 75 percent. But Mr. Sick ended up paying the $64,000 in seven months, giving the lender an annual return of some 130 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonbank Loans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO USES IT Seasonal businesses, microbusinesses and other businesses that cannot meet bank requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS Lighter Capital, a revenue-based finance company in Seattle, offers loans of $50,000 to $500,000 to small businesses with high gross margins. The borrower pays Lighter Capital 2 to 8 percent of its monthly revenue until the repayment amount is reached, and usually gives the lender warrants for 1 to 5 percent of the company. The country's 400 or so nonprofit community development financial institutions, on the other hand, fill the role of small community banks, lending to microbusinesses. ''Our clients are supplemental income businesses, like cupcake trucks and Main Street businesses whose lines of credit got called,'' said Claudia Viek, chief executive of the California Association for Micro Enterprise Opportunity, a network of California C.D.F.I.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Lighter Capital's chairman, Andy Sack, said the cost of obtaining financing from his company was around 20 percent annually. Ms. Viek said she expected California C.D.F.I.'s to make some 2,000 three- to five-year loans of up to $50,000 this year, at an average interest rate of about 8 percent. The rates can go as high as 14 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLE ''In the past, we would go to the local bank and get loans on signature,'' said Christi Riggs, 40, co-owner of Lone Star Linen laundry service, based in Taylor, Tex. When the bank said no, Ms. Riggs took out a loan from On Deck Capital, a New York-based company that analyzes business performance data -- cash flow, credit, even social media information -- to review loan applications from small businesses. Once granted, the loans, up to $150,000, are repaid through automatic daily bank account withdrawals, much as a merchant cash advance works. The short-term loans, typically for three to 18 months, charge an annual rate of 18 to 36 percent, said Noah Breslow, chief executive of On Deck. Ms. Riggs ended up paying $27,750 on a six-month loan of $25,500, or an annual rate of about 35 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS Individual investors combine to lend money to small-business owners through online vetting platforms like <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO USES IT Small-business owners with good credit scores who need money to expand or to buy equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Depending on the owners' credit ratings, annual rates can run from less than 7 percent to more than 25 percent. The loans are small, however, with a maximum of $35,000 at <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLE When Hannah Attwood wanted to raise money to open a cloth diaper supply and cleaning service, she went to four banks. ''They just kind of laughed at me,'' said Ms. Attwood, 34, founder of Adore Diaper Service, based in Ventura, Calif. She applied to <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> on a friend's suggestion, and within a week, 61 investors had jointly given her a three-year, $6,000 loan at 11.36 percent.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 22, 2013, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on the Small Business page on Aug. 2, about alternatives to bank lending for small businesses, gave incorrect rates for the interest that business owners would be paying on the alternative loans. Dennis Sick, owner of a restaurant in Baldwinsville, N.Y., anticipated an annual rate of 60 to 75 percent on an advance on credit card receipts, not 35 to 40 percent, and the lender actually got an annual return of 130 percent, not 70 percent. Christi Riggs, owner of a laundry service in Taylor, Tex., received a short-term loan repaid through automatic daily bank account withdrawals and paid an annual rate of about 35 percent, not 18 percent. This correction was delayed after being misdirected at The Times.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ouya, an inexpensive gaming console that runs on Android, is the latest experimental hardware project to take the Web by storm. It raised more than $8.5 million through Kickstarter, the crowd-funding Web site, in a campaign that ended early Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project first went live on Kickstarter's site in early July and quickly began attracting game enthusiasts who pledged money to help bring the project from the prototype stages into production. Those who kicked in $95 or more are slated to receive one of the consoles when they are ready to ship next March.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 60,000 people have gotten behind the project, and a number of high-profile partners, including Vevo, OnLive and Namco Bandai, a Japanese game publisher, have agreed to work with the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the company's early successes, the tale is far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, also called Ouya, will have to convince Android developers, who are already struggling with issues like piracy, to funnel resources into making games that can be played on a TV screen. The company will also have to finish building out the software, app store and payment platform that the machine will run on. It will have to compete with rivals like <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, <span class="companylink">Nintendo</span> and <span class="companylink">Sony</span> in the console market, and deal with the expectations of users, who will be anticipating a finished product that works as well as the competition. It will also have to contend with any unexpected hiccups and glitches that could arise and set back production, or unforeseen problems after release - issues that companies as well-staffed and funded as Jawbone, <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> have fielded with their hardware releases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first it will have to finish the design of the console and its controllers, something that is still being considered with input from gamers and users who are following the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Uhrman, the chief executive and founder of Ouya, which is based in Los Angeles, said she was not deterred by these challenges. She said Wednesday night that the money raised would allow her to build out the company, which now has 10 employees, and prepare to ship and sell the device in eight months. She said Ouya had enough money to guarantee that all 80,000 of the consoles that will be produced will be shipped to the people who have ordered them, through Kickstarter and a Web store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will absolutely be bringing a product to the platform in the coming months," Ms. Uhrman said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incubators have long existed for technology start-ups. But the needs of investment bankers are not quite the same as those of tech entrepreneurs who started a business in a garage and spent all night programming code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jolyne Caruso, experienced on Wall Street, took a page from the tech playbook to help seasoned financiers run their own firms. In 2010, she created the Alberleen Group, an incubator for investment bankers who have experience in their sectors and entrepreneurial attitudes but lack capital, investor contacts or support in areas like regulatory compliance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy remains lackluster and Wall Street keeps shedding jobs, Ms. Caruso is offering an alternative to the large firms and the more prominent boutique investment banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Wall Street has learned from the tech industry to be more nimble, the Alberleen Group's team members say they set themselves apart from other banks by providing more creative, customized services. In addition, the incubator has been able to attract clients who are often disenchanted with the higher fees, diminished service and potential for conflicts of interest at the big banks, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big investment banks continue to be tough places to work - between regulations, the lack of capital to fund deals and the broken compensation model," Ms. Caruso said, adding that the "misery factor" remains high even four years after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some Wall Street bankers have started boutique investment banks, not everyone has the investment capital or backing to do so. But because of the support of the Alberleen Group, which is affiliated with a registered broker-dealer, its banking teams can offer clients the gamut of investment banking services including bond financing, and advice on mergers and acquisitions or initial public offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Caruso's connections, cultivated during 30 years on Wall Street, provide an entree for the bankers, who focus on energy, real estate and middle-market deals. The Alberleen Group's advisory board members, who include E. Stanley O'Neal, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, are all investors in the company, giving them a stake in the success of its banking teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every banker thrives in such an entrepreneurial setting. Two bankers on the real estate team left after failing to generate revenue in Year 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Caruso said bankers who do well in the incubator setting must have an innate entrepreneurial flair in addition to extensive industry experience. Those who sit back and wait for work to find them will not last long. "They need to be scrappy," said Ms. Caruso, who spent nine years at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>, where she was managing director and chairman of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the age of 32, she was brought in from <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, where she had worked in equity sales, and was among the first outside hires to help build the bank's institutional equities division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She later co-founded and was president of Andor Capital Management, a $7 billion hedge fund, where she put in place functions like accounting and marketing and <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> registration requirements. And her work at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, where she was global head of absolute return strategies and a member of the firm's management committee, built on her experience (she left two years before Lehman's collapse).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before starting the Alberleen Group, she handled direct deals for investors. But while raising money for a solar energy transaction, she recognized that she lacked experience in the energy industry. She sought assistance from Steven Casey and his partner E. Scott Medla, bankers at CIT Energy. She had worked with Mr. Casey on previous deals, and he told Ms. Caruso he planned to leave CIT, which was in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was clear that if I wanted to do what I wanted to do, I had to move on," said Mr. Casey, who yearned for less bureaucracy and more control over his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was then that Ms. Caruso realized that many bankers shared Mr. Casey's frustrations. Together with Adam Goodfriend, the Alberleen Group's chief investment officer, she began work on a business plan for the incubator, which to her knowledge is the only such program for investment banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Casey and Mr. Medla were Ms. Caruso's first recruits. They now lead the Alberleen Group's five-person energy team and recently closed on a $180 million financing program in which two utility companies will supply equity capital for the construction of solar energy projects nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike bankers at boutique investment banks, those who join the Alberleen Group work for themselves, not as salaried employees. The Alberleen Group sets the teams up as limited liability companies and provides them with one year of working capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the start-up years, teams reside in the Alberleen Group's Midtown Manhattan offices, and receive management advice, deal distribution and capital-raising services and broker-dealer support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In exchange, the Alberleen Group typically takes one-third of each team's revenue, which should generally be about $5 million to $10 million annually. In Years 2 through 5, the teams are expected to be self-sufficient with the revenue they generate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the five years, the teams can either strike out on their own or become Alberleen Group partners with equity in the company while retaining their partnership in their investment banking team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the end of the day, you take your company with you," Ms. Caruso said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another banking team leader noted that a smaller organization comes with trade-offs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Alberleen Group has no enormous balance sheet to offer clients," said Blake Murphy, managing partner with TAG Access Partners, the incubator's team that works on midsize deals, whom Ms. Caruso has known since her days at <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>. The team compensates in other ways, he said; for example, by finding investors who bring industry experience in addition to capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Alberleen Group is outgunned by the Wall Street names. "This is not an incubator that's going to compete for a $50 billion M.&amp; A. deal," said David Stowell, clinical professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Another issue, he said, is whether the incubator will "be able to fill out its platform with a broad enough group of teams to create referrals and synergies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Caruso says she wants eventually to have 10 to 15 teams, including ones specializing in media/telecommunications and health care, as well as a presence in London and Asia. This summer, the Alberleen Group is raising a merchant banking fund that will enable it to co-invest in clients' deals, she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puneet Mehta, an Atlanta entrepreneur, remembers how eager he was to take the money. When investors courted him, he felt ''razzle-dazzled,'' enchanted by their promises to help him build the online marketing business he had founded in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal was to expand rapidly with private equity, put in a bunch of sales teams, get some distribution networks going,'' Mr. Mehta explained. He ended up with $1.5 million in private equity growth investments and venture capital. ''But I realized after we had raised the money that there were so many clauses that came with it that I had lost complete control of the company,'' he said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mehta quickly grew upset with his new bosses, who, he said, handed control to ''finance guys who had no idea what marketing was,'' moved operations into exorbitantly expensive office space, installed a board above him and hired a new president and chief financial officer with hefty salaries. ''Every day was torture to go in there, being an employee at the company I started,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning, he arrived at the office to learn that a beloved colleague had been fired. And so Mr. Mehta quit. The company's revenue dropped to zero, he said; today, it exists only on paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially since Mitt Romney's résumé became presidential campaign fodder, there has been much debate about the merits of private equity, which is known for its focus on short-term gains. Private equity investors typically use a mix of debt and equity to buy a large stake in underperforming companies, then re-engineer their financial, managerial and operational structures, with the goal of selling them at a profit within five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to horror stories like Mr. Mehta's and attack ads against Mr. Romney, the industry's reputation has taken some hits. But private equity remains a tempting option for some small-business owners. After all, bank credit has been hard to come by and other financing options can be extremely expensive. And with capital gains taxes expected to rise next year, some owners may be motivated to sell sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private equity firms in what is known as the lower-middle market typically seek out undervalued but scalable enterprises with more than $10 million in annual revenue and $3 million in Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. So should growth-minded owners like Mr. Mehta consider selling to private equity?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviews with a dozen small-business owners and investors revealed a common theme: Go slowly. Here are some things to consider before taking the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KNOW YOUR INVESTORS Private equity firms are not sentimental. They have an ironclad imperative: buy low, sell high. They usually purchase a controlling share in a company, bring in a combination of debt and equity, and manage the company in a way meant to increase its worth. Ideally, everyone profits when the company is sold, including the former owner, who gets a slice that is worth more than the original pie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most private equity investors are looking to make, at minimum, about two times their money and be in the deal for three to five years,'' said Daphne J. Dufresne, a managing director at RLJ Equity Partners. ''So if your plan was to pass your company down to your firstborn, then private equity is probably not a good fit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ''Starting with the end in mind is key,'' said Justin Redfearn McLain, managing member of Duart Mull, the investment management arm of a family trust in Atlanta. ''What do you want? Are you trying to get capital for growth or for yourself but continue in the day-to-day operations? Or do you just want out entirely?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners who hope to stay involved should remember that most private equity firms want a controlling stake. For some founders, becoming employees of the companies they created is fine, if that's what it takes to grow. For others, it's intolerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not my experience that private equity companies care about long-term value, because they're not in it for the long term, so it just wasn't in my nature to stay on,'' said Alan Newman, who started Seventh Generation, a distributor of household and personal care products, in 1988 and helped found Magic Hat, a beer company, in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He walked away from Magic Hat when his partners sold it to a private equity firm in 2010. For Mr. Newman, Magic Hat had never been entirely about profit. ''My vision was always creating this really cool, interesting company where people really liked work and we had an impact on our community,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Warrillow, a serial entrepreneur and the author of ''Built to Sell,'' put it in blunter terms. ''Provided your goals are aligned with theirs and you go into it with your eyes wide open, that is fine,'' he said, ''but they are not going to care about the soul of your company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DO YOUR HOMEWORK When considering a deal, entrepreneurs should run background checks, call a private equity firm's former clients and speak to members of corporate boards where the firm's investors are active. ''I'm doing diligence on you, you should do diligence on me,'' said Michael A. Smart, the managing partner of CSW, a private equity firm in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private equity partner should bring deep industry expertise, fresh connections and experience in tapping new markets: in short, more than just money. Troy D. Templeton, managing partner at Trivest, a firm in Coral Gables, Fla., that invests in founder- and family-owned businesses, said smart business owners should ask the following kinds of questions: Do the investors add value? Can they do things I could not do -- introduce me to new markets, help me source products from different areas, help me with online lead generation, bring me into the digital age?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an entrepreneur who finds the rare match of capital, talent and cooperation, the benefits of private equity can be considerable. ''They've got so many insights you can't even pay for,'' said Ryan Eleuteri, owner of the Charleston Beverage Company, which sells premium bloody mary mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, Mr. Eleuteri teamed up with Duart Mull, Mr. McLain's firm, which brought capital to the company -- both equity and debt -- and now owns 30 percent of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $50,000 in revenue for all of 2010, Charleston Beverage was an unusually small candidate for private equity. Duart Mull ''generally seeks companies that have a developed product and customer base,'' Mr. McLain explained. ''Albeit small, Charleston Beverage met these requirements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for his decision to purchase a minority stake, he said, ''We are doing this, in part, so Ryan and the other founders can retain majority ownership, because we want them to be motivated and incentivized to grow the company versus feeling like they are working for the investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eleuteri said his new partners helped him expand distribution. He now expects $250,000 to $300,000 in sales for 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I get to operate my business every day as a small-business owner, but if an issue arises, they've got a vested interest in my success,'' Mr. Eleuteri said of his partners. ''It's almost like having a big brother watching out for you. You get in a schoolyard fight and it's like, 'Do you really want to do this? I've got my 6-foot-4 linebacker brother behind me.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Mr. Mehta, the entrepreneur who said he was burned by private equity, there is no going back. He swore off outside financing altogether in his current endeavor, a start-up called Local Marketing Inc., which he said was profitable and generating several million dollars a year in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we basically get approached by a bank or a company every month to give us money,'' he said, ''but we don't need it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALBANY -- Representative Timothy H. Bishop of Long Island is visiting the Rocky Point Civic Association. Representative Kathy Hochul of Erie County is meeting with small business owners. And Representative Bill Owens of the North Country is discussing agriculture policy with the <span class="companylink">New York Farm Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With President Obama set to accept his party's renomination in three weeks, excuses are plentiful among Democratic members of Congress from New York State -- or at least those who are gearing up for tough re-election battles in November -- for why they cannot attend the Democratic National Convention.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of Democratic elected officials across the country have also sent their regrets. But the absences from New York are striking, because Mr. Obama is still very popular in the state, and is expected to win its electoral votes easily in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four incumbent Democrats facing the toughest challenges in New York -- Representatives Bishop, Hochul and Owens, as well as Representative Louise M. Slaughter of Rochester -- are all skipping the convention, which begins Sept. 4 in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late timing of the convention, after the traditional Labor Day kickoff to the fall campaign season, may be a factor in discouraging some lawmakers from attending the convention. And a court-ordered redistricting plan has forced many incumbents in New York to woo voters they have not previously represented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Almost any candidate is better off staying home,'' said Lawrence Levy, an expert on suburban politics at Hofstra University. ''It's Labor Day -- there are parades, there are barbecues, there are block parties. These are the staples of retail campaigning. Why would you want to take time away?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decisions, in some cases, also reflect the reality that even in some pockets of a state as reliably blue as New York, Democrats do not see the president as a political asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Half the electorate is really not happy at this point with the president's leadership, and so that doesn't provide members of the House with much of a basis for thinking there will be coattails for them to ride on,'' said James E. Campbell, a professor of political science at the State University at Buffalo. ''I don't think they're running away from him, but I don't think they're running to be seen as a close ally of his, either.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, some elected officials have skipped conventions for a variety of reasons, and this year, some Republican officeholders will be skipping their party's convention in Tampa, Fla. Democratic Congressional leaders have given an explicit blessing for rank-and-file lawmakers to miss the convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Steve Israel, a New York Democrat and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in June that, whatever Mr. Obama's popularity, he would advise incumbents in contested races to consider staying home. ''If they want to win an election, they need to be in their districts,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Republicans are seizing on the planned absences as proof of what they describe as Mr. Obama's vulnerability -- and the political liability he could pose to fellow Democrats who are seeking re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They do not want to be associated with their presidency,'' said Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most optimistic Republicans do not doubt that Mr. Obama will win New York in November. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York State roughly 2 to 1, and two polls conducted last month, one by Siena College and one by Quinnipiac University, found Mr. Obama with a strong lead of more than 20 percentage points over Mitt Romney in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Republicans see a far rosier picture when they look at the state's Congressional map, which has been reduced to 27 districts from 29 to reflect national population shifts identified by the 2010 Census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest indicator of the competitive landscape came Thursday: the <span class="companylink">National Republican Congressional Committee</span> said that it had reserved more than $4 million in New York television airtime starting after Labor Day, including six-figure purchases in the districts of Mr. Bishop, Mr. Owens and Ms. Hochul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demographics of the districts, and therefore the political calculations about the president, vary -- in 2008, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, Senator John McCain, won the area that now makes up Ms. Hochul's district; Mr. Obama won the communities in the districts where the other three Democrats facing the most competitive races are running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also four districts held by Republicans in which Democratic challengers are competitive, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. One of the Democratic challengers, Dan Maffei, is a former member of Congress seeking to unseat Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, the Republican who defeated him two years ago; Mr. Maffei will be in Syracuse, not Charlotte, at the start of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey M. Stonecash, a professor of political science at <span class="companylink">Syracuse University</span>, said some Democrats in upstate districts that have a history of electing Republicans ''don't want anything to do with Obama'' as November approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''An opponent would use their presence there to point out to everybody that they're schmoozing with Obama while jobs are not growing in New York,'' Professor Stonecash said. ''Why risk that? What's the gain there?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the four Democrats were eager to talk about why they were skipping the convention, or whether their decision to stay home had anything to do with Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guarantee that my time will be better spent meeting the farmers, small business owners and other people who put me here,'' Ms. Hochul said. And Ms. Slaughter said, simply, ''I have a lot of work to do at home. I'll be here working in the district.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Oliver Longwell, a spokesman for Mr. Bishop, said the congressman ''decided it's a better use of his time to meet with constituents, small business owners and senior citizens'' during the time of the convention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's got a full calendar,'' Mr. Longwell promised.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act -- Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups -- is a bad law. Enacted in April, it ends longstanding investor protections, reduces market transparency and lowers accounting and auditing standards for companies that are planning to go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a difference, however, between bad and worse. In recent weeks, the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> has been under pressure from Congress to rush ahead with regulations to put the law into effect, without first issuing proposed rules and seeking public comment. A rushed process would deprive investor advocates of the chance to weigh in on how to carry out the law while still protecting individual investors from fraud.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, however, the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary Schapiro, confirmed that the agency would not ram new rules through without public comment. She will undoubtedly take political heat for the decision, but she has made the right call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue are rules on ''general solicitations,'' or mass advertising of nonpublic securities to individual investors. Before the JOBS Act, general solicitations were banned, a measure that shielded the general public from offerings that are difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate without special inside knowledge -- and that are prone to fraud. Private companies, including hedge funds and venture capital firms, could direct their offerings only to ''accredited investors,'' those with at least $1 million in net worth (not including a home) or at least $200,000 of yearly income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the JOBS Act, the S.E.C. is required to lift the ban on general solicitations for private stock offerings. But investors in such deals must still meet the net worth or income requirements in previous law. It is up to the S.E.C. to provide ''reasonable steps'' that private-stock issuers must take to ensure that their investors qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge funds are pushing for loose standards; investor advocates have rightly called for strict standards to ensure that everyday investors are not drawn into unsuitable, and potentially fraudulent, high-risk investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act makes the world less safe for investors. Done right, the rules the S.E.C. imposes can at least minimize the harm that is sure to come.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new graduates, shifting from college to a full-time job can deliver a jolt of culture shock. That's doubly true for those who join start-ups, where teams are small and newcomers are often expected to acclimate quickly, finding their way without much formal training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Boston Startup School. Designed as a "finishing school" for young people seeking jobs in the city's tech start-up scene, the program's inaugural six-week session graduated 72 students this month. It was directed by Aaron O'Hearn, who also heads up special projects at TechStars Boston, where the idea for the program grew out of the awareness that most start-ups have little time for human resources, recruiting and professional development. "We wanted to graduate people who can operate with ambiguity, who can understand where they are and what needs to get done," Mr. O'Hearn said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first session offered four tracks of study - marketing, software development, product design, and sales and business development - housed at the Harvard Innovation Lab and taught by 50 volunteer instructors. Though Boston Startup School is a for-profit entity, the program was tuition-free, with operating costs underwritten by "hiring partners" - Boston-area companies like Brightcove and Trip Advisor, which received early access to the students - along with sponsors that included <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and <span class="companylink">Silicon Valley Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me it's about how you give them the tools to be successful," said Mark Chang, an associate professor at Olin College who is currently on leave and serving as the director of product at edX, a non-profit online educational venture from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It's like a modern reinvention of trade school."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chang helped develop the curriculum for Boston Startup School, a process that involved tapping dozens of start-up leaders to learn what skills young hires weren't getting in college but needed in the workplace. "We're not here to create rock stars, unicorns, superheroes or ninjas, whatever the buzzword is right now," he added. "We've only got six weeks. We're here to get them a little bit closer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how did things work out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the short time frame, this summer's crop of students managed to dance around whiteboards for a homemade music video and create Shepard Fairey-inspired posters honoring the program's organizers. More to the point, Mr. O'Hearn said that more than half of the students have been hired since the program concluded on Aug. 1 with the students pitching their skills in front of representatives from nearly 100 young businesses. Boston Startup School began accepting applications for a second session on Aug. 27. The new class is scheduled to arrive Nov. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angus Davis, chief executive of Swipely, a customer loyalty and analytics start-up, said he was impressed with the program's graduates and has already hired one for his engineering group. "The toughest thing is finding talented people as we seek to grow our team," he added. "We've got a few others in the pipeline. We'll see how it all pans out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Boston Startup School alumna, Nicki Haylon, 22, said she had planned a career in book publishing after graduating from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. But her six-week introduction to start-ups, "blew my mind from the first day" and helped her realize that "it wasn't so much the publishing industry I liked, so much as being with a tight-knit group of people who are working passionately to create something." This month she accepted a job with Libboo, a Boston start-up whose online platform aims to connect authors and readers.</p>

A picture of Mr. Ryan with President Obama is on the wall and an ornate Oscar de la Renta gown hangs from the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a man who would blend in among the sneaker-clad start-up ranks of Silicon Valley. Yet Mr. Ryan, chief executive of the Gilt Groupe and a founder of several prominent Internet companies, is one of the technology world's most influential people, with a career trajectory that mirrors the rise of New York's tech scene.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan and Dwight Merriman run a start-up factory called AlleyCorp, after Silicon Alley, a nickname given to New York's answer to Silicon Valley. It has churned out companies that have almost nothing in common, from e-commerce to publishing to database software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about this start-up grab bag, Mr. Ryan smiled and said, ''Are you saying I have a focus problem?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gilt.com, which sells luxury goods like designer clothes and vacation packages, is considering going public next year. Business Insider, another AlleyCorp company, is a blog publisher with 19 million readers a month, run by Henry Blodget, the infamous former Internet stock analyst. And <span class="companylink">10gen</span>, which makes MongoDB, open-source database software that is used by companies like <span class="companylink">Disney</span> and <span class="companylink">Foursquare</span>, was valued at $500 million by venture capitalists who invested $50 million in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies contribute to New York's growing role as an Internet hub, particularly for the new generation of online media and retail companies. Last year, 256 New York tech start-ups raised $2.2 billion in investment, up from 149 and $1.3 billion five years ago, according to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Silicon Valley is on their fifth generation,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We're on our second or third generation of New York entrepreneurs, combined with a bigger and better infrastructure to support it, so the scene is just mushrooming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan made his name during the first tech boom as chief executive of DoubleClick, the digital advertising company that <span class="companylink">Google</span> bought for $3.1 billion in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He doesn't fit into the Valley mold as much, but he's definitely one of the most prominent people here,'' said Chris Dixon, a New York tech investor and entrepreneur. ''He went off and did this thing that entrepreneurs fantasize about, starting multiple companies and having them be really successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other veteran entrepreneurs are doing variations on the idea of a factory for start-ups, including Evan Williams and Biz Stone, two of Twitter's founders, who now run a start-up lab called Obvious, and Craig Walker, who developed the technology that became <span class="companylink">Google</span> Voice and now runs Firespotter Labs. Kevin Rose, co-founder of Digg, started a similar company called Milk before joining <span class="companylink">Google</span> in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan compares his formula to dating -- try out a bunch of start-ups and see what sticks. He and Mr. Merriman started the companies and then hired people to run them when they began to take off. In the case of Gilt, Mr. Ryan hired Alexis Maybank and Alexandra Wilkis Wilson as co-founders, then returned to run it himself once it became big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He now spends most of his time at Gilt but splits 10 percent of it between Business Insider, where he is chairman, and <span class="companylink">10gen</span>, where he is a board member. Mr. Merriman is chief executive of <span class="companylink">10gen</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other AlleyCorp companies, ShopWiki for comparison shopping and Panther Express for delivering content over the Web, were acquired, but not at prices high enough to make the deals profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan's ideas are not novel. He borrowed the idea of flash sales at Gilt from vente-privee.com, a flash-sale site in France. Business Insider followed blog networks like <span class="companylink">Gawker Media</span>, and <span class="companylink">10gen</span>'s software is similar to <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>'s MySQL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hardly anything is a really brand-new idea on a global scale,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''What makes companies successful is a different version of something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He considers his greatest skill to be hiring the right people. And increasingly, those people are in New York instead of the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When tech meant only hardware and chips, Silicon Valley, home to Stanford's computer science department and large swaths of land for big factories, was the obvious epicenter. But today, a new tech company is more likely to be in retail, media or advertising -- all industries based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want financial journalists, the reality is there are more in New York,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''If you want people who know fashion, there's got to be 10 times more in New York. If you want to be selling to ad agencies, you're in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''You're already seeing huge sectors of the Internet dominate in New York, not competing with San Francisco but dominating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryan does not venture to Silicon Valley very often, mostly because he says it is not relevant to his businesses, even for raising money, which he said had changed since the first tech boom in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 16 rounds of financing he has raised for his companies in the last five years, just two came from a West Coast venture capital firm, Sequoia Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he did show up in Silicon Valley, he would certainly stand out. Unlike founders in the mold of Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Ryan, 48, is married with three children in junior high and high school. Then there are his suits. The Internet world in New York is slightly more formal, he said, and the valley's hoodies and jeans would not fly at New York cocktail parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For me, the jacket, tie-less look goes anywhere,'' he said. Also, unlike most tech entrepreneurs, Mr. Ryan does not know how to write software code. Mr. Merriman, who was co-founder and chief technology officer at DoubleClick, provided the technical brains for the companies, Mr. Ryan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His ambition extends to his personal life. He trains for triathlons and plays competitive table tennis (people who work at Gilt warn new employees to stay away from Mr. Ryan at the table). There is also his borderline obsession with Halloween. A couple of years ago he dressed up as a flash sale, wearing no pants and a flasher's overcoat that he opened to display pictures of things Gilt offers, like watches, underwear and stays at a Paris hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending a few years on Wall Street and working in finance and operations at <span class="companylink">Disney</span>, Mr. Ryan landed at United Media when the Internet was taking off. In 1995 he started the Dilbert Web site, which took off quickly because early users of the Web were often Dilbert fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I was here in 1996, everyone was asking me, 'Why aren't you in San Francisco? Why aren't you in Boston?' '' Mr. Ryan said. ''Today, no one asks that.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Britain's Conservative-led government, seeking to deflect calls for a major change of economic strategy, said Sunday that it would ease planning laws and increase lending to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister David Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, are under growing pressure as their austerity plan fails to stimulate growth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes at the top are widely expected early this month, with some pundits and even one Conservative lawmaker openly suggesting that Mr. Osborne could be replaced, although insiders say Mr. Cameron is likely to leave the chancellor in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Davis, a senior lawmaker in Mr. Cameron's governing Conservative Party, called Sunday for an ''alternative'' economic policy, days after another Conservative politician goaded Mr. Cameron by asking whether he was a ''man or a mouse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Parliament due to reconvene on Monday after the summer recess, Mr. Cameron struck back in an article in The Mail on Sunday headlined, ''Cameron roars: I'm no mouse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly,'' he said in the article, ''I am frustrated by the hoops you have to jump through to get anything done -- and I come back to Parliament more determined than ever to cut through the dither that holds this country back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne defended his record on Sunday, adding that the government, which is halfway through its term, would speed up construction plans and that legislation would be announced next week allowing the state to underwrite infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our economy is healing, jobs are being created. It is taking time, but there is no easy route to a magical recovery,'' he told the BBC. ''We have to do more, and we have to do it faster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British economy has shrunk for three consecutive quarters, and although data in August showed that the latest quarterly contraction was smaller than first thought, the wider picture of economic weakness remains little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restrictions on construction in rural areas, or the greenbelt, have hampered building in some parts of Britain, and Mr. Osborne said he would like to see more programs in which land is newly designated as greenbelt to free up other parts of the countryside for housing and other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential infrastructure project that has become highly controversial is a third runway at Britain's largest airport, Heathrow, something explicitly ruled out by the Conservatives in their pre-election manifesto and opposed by environmental groups and people living nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne said ''all options'' should be examined, but political consensus must be reached. Foreign Secretary William Hague told Sky News on Sunday that a third runway was not an option, and the Conservatives' partners in coalition government, the Liberal Democrats, also oppose the move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne said the low level of bank lending was one of the economy's key weaknesses and proposed a ''small business bank'' to bring together existing programs to increase lending to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he would welcome the move. He said the bank ''would be a game-changer for long-term growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labour, the opposition party, was less impressed, blaming the lack of construction in Britain on cuts to public investment and a lack of confidence in the economy. ''The chancellor seems desperate to cling on to his failing plan, regardless of the long term damage,'' said Labour's finance spokesman, Chris Leslie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberal Democrats' leader and deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, also faces heat from his party as it seeks to raise its slumping opinion poll ratings before the next election in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sunday Times carried comments from a Liberal Democrat lawmaker, Adrian Sanders, calling Mr. Clegg ''bumbling.'' Another senior party member, Arthur Smith, warned that Mr. Clegg was not ''indispensable.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't have to spend much time in Silicon Valley to start hearing that the people don't care about money. People here are just trying to make the world a better place. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists eat ramen noodles for dinner and drive old, clunky Hondas to work. If they do make money, that's just a tiny cherry on top of their altruistic Tofutti soy whip sundae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what people here would like the world to think. Let's be realistic, these start-ups aren't nonprofit organizations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1,500-square-mile area of Silicon Valley has seen the greatest wealth creation in history. According to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>, start-ups here raised $3.2 billion in venture capital just from April to June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people making money from successful start-ups are spending it, too. Last month, RealtyTrac, a real estate analysis firm, reported that Silicon Valley led the nation in the number of homes sold for $1 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's not forget the tone-deaf parties, like one for David Sacks, the founder of Yammer, who sold his company to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> this year for $1.2 billion. He spent about $1.4 million on a 40th-birthday bash for himself. The theme was, "Let him eat cake." Mr. Sacks asked guests not to share pictures of the event on social networks. Snoop Dogg, who was hired to sing at the party, shared pictures anyway of people in 18th-century French clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, the first 250 employees are on a highly secret list called TNR250, for The Nouveau Riche 250. They discuss things they plan to buy when they sell their hundreds of millions of dollars in stock: boats, planes, artwork, even an island. (To be fair, philanthropy is also discussed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all of this is kept quiet and behind closed doors. Not shared publicly on social networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, of course, several reasons the Valley tries to keep its wealth so secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's the embarrassment left over from the dot-com crash, which began in 2000. True, the parties then would make today's celebrations look like backyard barbecues with Betty Crocker cupcakes for birthday cake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some Valley denizens sense a shift has occurred as the wealth has become easy. "Today, being a venture capitalist is more about a lifestyle than it is about investing," said Roger McNamee, a co-founder of the tech investment firm <span class="companylink">Elevation Partners</span>. "They're making a million bucks a year without generating much, if any, return. It's like watching Fox News - these people are living in an alternate reality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This trend extends beyond the new fee-hungry venture capitalists. "Just as venture capital has become a lifestyle, you now have a generation where being an entrepreneur is a lifestyle," he said. This is evident in the ease with which "entrepreneurs" are given millions of dollars to create companies that differ only slightly from other successful start-ups - like Instagram for video, or Twitter for cats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of the biggest reasons people here try to pretend they don't care about the money is that some of the most successful people actually don't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was never driven by money. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, appears, very publicly and honestly, to focus on building a company, not a six-car garage full of toys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Steve Jobs was very clear: he said, 'Change the world, and the world will take good care of you,' and people like Zuckerberg have absolutely followed that calling," Mr. McNamee said. "But I think that you get one entrepreneur in 10 or 100 who is actually like that. For every Mark Zuckerberg, there are 10 guys pretending to be Mark Zuckerberg."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Valley doesn't need to act as if it's not interested in money - spending responsibly is a good thing. Focusing on making worthwhile start-ups grow is even better. We already have enough people pretending to be the Sun King.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you made a list of things lawmakers of both parties profess to value at all times -- like ''jobs,'' ''opportunity,'' ''veterans,'' ''law enforcement,'' ''firefighters,'' ''safe streets,'' ''small business'' -- and plugged them into a Congressional bill-writing app, you would probably end up with something like the Veterans Job Corps Act of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill, sponsored by Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, would hire veterans as firefighters and police officers and for conservation jobs in national parks and on other public lands, through grants to federal departments and agencies and contracts with state and local governments and private organizations. It would give a lift to veteran entrepreneurs and contractors in various ways, like making it easier for veterans to use their military training to qualify for civilian professional licenses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill gives priority to those who served on or after 9/11, with good reason: the jobless rate for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan hit 10.9 percent in August, compared with 8.1 percent nationally. This is a time of persistent homelessness and unemployment among veterans, and record suicides among veterans and active-duty service members, many of them stressed by the burdens of two long wars. It makes sense for the 99 percent of Americans to find new ways to pay their debt to the 1 percent who serve in uniform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To most people, Senator Murray's bill would seem like one decent way to do that. But not if you're one of those Republicans in Washington who thinks it's more important in an election year to deny Democrats a success or accomplishment of any kind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has led to some wacky maneuvers in the Senate. Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, perhaps forgetting where he worked, denounced the legislation as a ''political exercise.'' He also called it a waste of time, since the House wasn't going to pass it anyway, and objected to the cost (estimated at $1 billion for the next five years, though Ms. Murray's aides say the program will be paid for by recovering more money from tax-delinquent Medicare providers and forcing big tax deadbeats to pay up before receiving passports).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Where is our honor? Where is our valor? Where is our sacrifice?'' thundered Mr. Coburn, suggesting that giving jobs to veterans was an affront to American values. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, went further, saying he would block the bill until Pakistan freed Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the United States find Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Murray has tried to make her bill as bipartisan as possible. When Senator Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, proposed his own set of provisions, she folded them all into the bill, which is scheduled for a vote on Wednesday. We'll know then whether good sense prevailed, or the wheels have come completely off the Congressional machine.</p>

And what could be a more enticing image than homemade pie?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its new campaign, <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span> retail stores focus on how a small business like the ''pie lady'' can get help from her local store to specially package, promote and ship her bakery creations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I make the crust by hand. I make the filling by hand. But to build my business, I need a hand,'' said Sandy Poehnelt, who runs the Right Slice bakery in Kauai, Hawaii, in a print, television, radio and online campaign that started this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her local U.P.S. retail store designed a shipping box to ensure that her mango passion fruit, blueberry piña colada and dozens of other pie varieties arrive fresh and intact. That has enabled her to expand her business from Hawaii to other parts of the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially known as the UPS Store, the retail locations are independently owned and operated by franchisees of Mail Boxes Etc ., a subsidiary of U.P.S., and are being revamped to offer a broader range of business services. In addition to packing and shipping items, UPS Stores are also supplying printing services -- banners, brochures, menus and many other products -- as well as faxing, direct mailing and mailbox services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners and employees of the stores have been retrained and have new uniforms. Stores have a bright aqua and teal color scheme, and some locations have new equipment. But U.P.S. is keeping its distinctive brown and gold corporate shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our research shows that the majority of small businesses feel they don't get support to cope with their challenges,'' said Michelle Van Slyke , vice president of marketing and small business solutions at the UPS Store headquarters in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using focus groups, surveys and techniques like journals kept by small-business owners, the company found last year that most small-business owners wanted to work with other local business people because they felt they could trust them more and because their economic health was linked, Ms. Van Slyke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many did not know that their community UPS Store was a franchise operated by a local owner, she said. Nor did they always know the full range of services the store provided, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, she said, a third of the customers of the 4,300 UPS Stores are small businesses -- with 10 or fewer people or individuals -- that accounted for 75 percent of overall revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To attract more small enterprises, the UPS Store's ''Small Business Solutions'' campaign emphasizes that its new services can be customized, like the specially designed pie box, to meet a specific business need. In a two-minute video, Ms. Poehnelt traces how she arrived from Wisconsin three years ago, then opened a pie shop to make use of her baking skills and, with the help of her local UPS Store, a mail-order business that ships pies around the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local UPS Store also does her printing, including business cards, menus and gift certificates, the video notes. The stores, which compete with <span class="companylink">FedEx Office</span> , <span class="companylink">Office Depot</span> and even the local post office, say their services can be bundled into accounts for monthly billing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doner, an advertising agency based in Detroit, designed the multifaceted campaign to underscore the message that the neighborhood UPS Store is the ''repository of solutions to help small businesses,'' said Clint White, the agency's brand leader for the stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three television commercials, by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Chicago, humorously highlight the UPS Store's connection to small and individual business owners. One, called ''Mailboxes,'' shows various box renters peering into ''their office'' and explaining why it is valuable to them. Another shows a building contractor, who relies on his UPS Store's services to meet demands from clients, including a woman who commissions a doghouse that is a replica of her elaborate house. The 30- and 60-second commercials will appear on prime-time shows like ''The X Factor,'' and on cable, late-night shows and N.F.L. games and <span class="companylink">ESPN</span> Monday Night Football. The <span class="companylink">CBS</span> anchor Charles Osgood will voice the campaign's ads on his radio broadcasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign also will advertise on digital media, mobile video and video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> , <span class="companylink">Hulu</span> and other online sites.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDSAN FRANCISCO - The ground floor of 139 Townsend Street has all the markings of a start-up: exposed lighting, long communal tables and an odd assortment of knickknacks, including a fire-engine-red British telephone booth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the brick industrial building, in San Francisco's SoMa district, is not the home of Twitter, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> or another up-and-coming Internet company. It's the office of <span class="companylink">Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati</span>, the half-century-old law firm.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a marketing benefit," said Yoichiro Taku, a partner at Wilson Sonsini who represents many early-stage companies. "It definitely makes us hipper."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson Sonsini's new outpost reflects the firm's evolving mind-set as lawyers jockey for the attention of start-ups. In an effort to build credibility among new technology companies, Wilson Sonsini and others are employing a broad set of tools, including offering free services, cozying up to incubators and writing blogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such efforts are critical. While early-stage ventures represent just 20 percent of the firm's business, those companies can generate hefty fees as they mature. Wilson Sonsini and other firms also make small investments in young start-ups, which can pay off in later years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Small deals would not have interested these firms a few years ago," said Joseph A. Grundfest, a Stanford law professor. "Now, it's the new normal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Wilson Sonsini dominated Silicon Valley, shepherding young technology companies like Apple, <span class="companylink">Netscape Communications</span> and even the ill-fated Webvan. In 1998, Lawrence W. Sonsini, the firm's patriarch, introduced two Stanford graduate students to Sequoia Capital and <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, two top venture capital firms. Six years later, Wilson Sonsini helped their company, <span class="companylink">Google</span>, go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the firm plays in an increasingly crowded space. In the 1960s when it was first founded, only a handful of law firms had offices in the region. Now scores blanket the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were left alone in this market for an absurdly long period of time in the '80s and '90s," said Steven E. Bochner, a partner at Wilson Sonsini. "Everyone is here now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dow Jones VentureSource, the firm represented the most venture capital deals in the first half of this year, with 157 transactions, nearly double its closest competitor. But its once-absolute grip on the market has slackened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last wave of Internet initial public offerings, the law firm picked up LinkedIn's prized sale, as well as those of Splunk and <span class="companylink">Palo Alto Networks</span>. But it did not land <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> or, most significantly, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which went to its rival, <span class="companylink">Fenwick &amp; West</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no one at Wilson Sonsini is exclusively focused on start-ups, a few lawyers have emerged as leaders in this area. Mr. Taku, 44, a native of Japan who joined the firm 16 years ago, has helped broker partnerships with several incubators like AngelPad and <span class="companylink">Founder Institute</span>, which help Wilson Sonsini get a first peek at fledgling start-ups. And he runs startupcompanylawyer.com, a personal Web site where he muses on topics like incorporation and financing. Mr. Taku often collaborates with Todd Carpenter, who helped lead the effort to open the SoMa office. And Mr. Sonsini still tries to meet with one or two start-ups a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For big law firms, courting young companies is something of a balancing act. On the one hand, a firm wants to reach the highest number of top-shelf start-ups. But it has limited resources, so it has to be choosy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, many have taken steps to reduce the cost of early-stage venture financing for entrepreneurs, while automating the process to make it easier for lawyers. <span class="companylink">Fenwick &amp; West</span> has been at the forefront of this trend. Two years ago, the law firm created and posted standardized deal documents online for free downloading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Wilson Sonsini teamed up with AngelList, a network for investors and entrepreneurs, to also offer free standardized deal documents online. Although start-ups can use any law firm to process the forms, Wilson Sonsini has offered to do it pro bono if a start-up becomes a client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're trying to show we can add value to the community." said Mr. Carpenter, who worked on the AngelList project with Mr. Taku and Mr. Bochner. "So hopefully, when these start-ups need a lawyer, they think of us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Smith, a recent London transplant and co-founder of Vungle, a video advertising platform, met Mr. Taku through AngelPad. Mr. Taku offered to defer legal costs up to $5,000. Mr. Smith, who had read Mr. Taku's blog, was sold. He was also able to wring out additional hours with Mr. Taku, known as Yokum, who often holds free office hours at AngelPad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yokum was kind of a celebrity for us," he said. Months later, the start-up remains a client, but it now has to adjust to a more normal fee structure. "They are charging us more - you quickly learn what you can bother your lawyer with."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiatives aim to be founder-friendly. In August, Mr. Taku worked with Adeo Ressi, the founder of the <span class="companylink">Founder Institute</span>, to create a financing alternative to convertible debt, which has been popular among entrepreneurs but can burden start-ups with debt. Mr. Taku and Mr. Ressi came up with standardized convertible equity documents. Convertible equity solves some of the problems of debt financing by eliminating the interest rate and the need for repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the AngelList program, those documents are available free online. The initiative set off lively debate, prompting blog posts from several influential venture capitalists, including Fred Wilson of <span class="companylink">Union Square Ventures</span> and Mark Suster, a partner at <span class="companylink">GRP Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of Wilson Sonsini's competitors said they were skeptical that these broad efforts would amount to much. Indeed, some initiatives have been expensive ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year the firm signed a five-year lease on the SoMa locale, shorthand for the neighborhood South of Market Street, a mile away from the company's flagship San Francisco office. While four partners work out of the SoMa office, it's also intended to be an open, collaborative space that can be used by start-ups and entrepreneurial organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Tuesday, the office was co-hosting a pitch event for 30 new start-ups, a chance for companies to present their products to potential investors and win entrance to a coming technology conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the event was organized by DEMO, a technology conference business, Wilson Sonsini provided free pizza and Trumer Pils, a popular beer brewed in nearby Berkeley. At other times, the firm has held seminars on hiring, employee liquidity events like an I.P.O., and data privacy, which featured regulators from the <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being a mile away can be a huge difference," said Mr. Carpenter.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, the number 18 has crept into President Obama's campaign speeches -- as in, "We've cut taxes for small businesses 18 times." (That's from a speech in Melbourne, Fla., last month.) The first lady, Michelle Obama, mentions it, too. And, of course, it came up frequently at the Democratic National Convention a few weeks ago, where it caught the attention of a regular You're The Boss commenter who calls himself Einstein. (No, not that Einstein.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Which small businesses had their taxes cut?" Einstein recently asked. "Hate to be skeptical but I know a lot of small-business owners and independent contractors and they never heard of ANY tax cuts. All this talk of helping small business from both political parties sounds like lip service. What are the facts?"</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy to oblige, Einstein. Back in 2010, when the administration's boast was that it had merely cut taxes 16 times, The Agenda wrote a post about it. Here are the White House's 16 "tax cuts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the 2009 stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, and other legislation:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new small-business health care tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tax credit for hiring unemployed workers in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary extension of bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">75 percent exclusion of small-business capital gains, for stock acquired in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary expansion of limits on small-business expensing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-year carryback of net operating losses, available through fall 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses to seven years, from 10, in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary small-business estimated tax payment relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax provisions in the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act (both The Agenda and the I.R.S. have published summaries):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">100 percent exclusion of small-business capital gains, for stock acquired in late 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A further increase to the expensing limit to $500,000 for 2011 (in 2012, the limit falls to $139,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A further extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation through 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax relief and simplification for cellphone deductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs' start-up expenses in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-year carry-back of general business credits in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower penalties for failing to report listed (that is, abusive) tax shelters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the president has added two more tax cuts to the list, according to a Small Business Administration spokeswoman, who supplied an update:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing bonus depreciation to 100 percent for 2011 (from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, the compromise law that keeps the Bush income tax cuts in place through this year; for 2012, bonus depreciation falls to 50 percent and then expires).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax credits for hiring veterans, ranging from $2,400 to $9,600 (from the Veterans Opportunity to Work to Hire Heroes Act of 2011).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you can see, some of these aren't tax cuts in the way many people would define them. Rather, they're tax incentives - you've got to spend money (on health insurance, a new employee or new equipment) to save money. Several are improvements or extensions of previous tax incentives. (By that score, some other measures could also be counted as tax cuts, but don't appear on the administration's list - for example, the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act further reduced the built-in gains period to five years for an asset sold in the 2011 tax year.) And, of course, most were temporary, and have already expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So has the president really cut taxes 18 (or more) times? We've reported - now you decide.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill de Blasio, the New York public advocate, laid out a provocative plan on Thursday to finance education programs by raising income taxes on the city's wealthiest residents, an early populist salvo in his presumptive campaign for mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at a breakfast event for a prominent civic group, Mr. de Blasio also attacked a mayoral rival, Speaker Christine C. Quinn of the City Council, for proposing a set of small-business reforms that he dismissed as ''a joke,'' and he chastised Ms. Quinn for declining to challenge Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on the issue.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio's criticisms were a signal of the intraparty combat that is expected to accompany a competitive, and potentially decisive, Democratic primary in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the focus of his speech -- education -- also proved contentious, with members of the well-heeled audience seemingly cool to his idea of raising taxes to provide more prekindergarten classes and after-school activities for students in grades six through eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio argued that improvements in early childhood education were critical to improving the city's long-term economy and its middle class. He estimated that the new programs would cost about $500 million, which could be generated through a small tax surcharge on New Yorkers who earn $500,000 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea would be not to build more bureaucracy, but to build the middle class, to give kids the kind of educational foundation they need to move forward,'' Mr. de Blasio told members of the Association for a Better New York, a group whose events are a standard stop on the city's political circuit. ''We will be asking people who worked hard and have done well to contribute a little more and make this happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person earning $1 million in annual income would pay an additional $2,120 under Mr. de Blasio's plan, which was modeled after a similar surcharge used to hire new police officers under a 1990s anticrime initiative of Mayor David N. Dinkins, Mr. de Blasio's former employer. Any new surcharge would require approval by the State Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio's proposal was an incursion into policy territory typically dominated by Ms. Quinn, who has made early childhood education a priority. This year, Ms. Quinn successfully pressed Albany to make kindergarten mandatory for 5-year-olds; Mr. de Blasio said his proposal would affect 4-year-olds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio is a longtime beneficiary of labor support whose expected candidacy has been viewed warily by the city's business elite. His proposal received a tepid response from the crowd, which included many wealthy civic leaders who would almost certainly be affected by his higher tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A question from the audience that challenged the rationale behind Mr. de Blasio's tax proposal received more applause than many lines in his prepared remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you come to a group like this and you say to them, 'I want to tax you,' they immediately shut down,'' said Ernest A. Logan, president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, a city union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. de Blasio, who joked in his speech that he was delivering his remarks in ''the lion's den,'' said he believed that the goal of improving the city's schools ought to require some investment from the wealthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a roomful of people who know our educational status quo is unacceptable,'' Mr. de Blasio said. He added, of his proposal, ''I'm sure they'd love it if there was some other way to fund it, but I bet they will not disagree that this is fundamental to our future success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio has reached out to small-business groups in recent weeks, and he criticized a recent plan by Speaker Quinn and Mayor Bloomberg to simplify regulation of city businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What the mayor and the speaker did was lip service,'' Mr. de Blasio told reporters after his speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't really intend to change it, and they should just come out and say that,'' Mr. de Blasio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of Ms. Quinn, he added, ''She is clearly not challenging the mayor, and working with him to continue a bad policy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn's office referred an inquiry about Mr. de Blasio's speech to Robert Bookman, a lawyer who often represents the hospitality industry in disputes with the city. Mr. Bookman said he was disappointed to hear Mr. de Blasio dismiss an effort that he said would help small-business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He should be careful who he's insulting when he does this kind of stuff,'' Mr. Bookman said of the public advocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg had his own sharp words for Mr. de Blasio, telling reporters that the public advocate wishes to tax ''anything and everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He wants to drive everybody out of the city,'' the mayor, who has clashed frequently with Mr. de Blasio, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. He added, in a sarcastic tone: ''But that's O.K. He's a good guy.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBAI -- On a recent Thursday evening, ahead of the Islamic weekend, the newest cafe-office space in Dubai, Make business hub, was busy and buzzy. About 60 guests from the United Arab Emirates and nearby countries were being courted by seven international start-ups, who were presenting their business plans in the hope of attracting angel investors and venture capital funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-ups had been discovered by SeedStartup, a venture capital fund and start-up accelerator program based in Dubai. ''We invest between $20,000 and $25,000 in businesses we believe have potential and take a 10 percent equity,'' said Rony el-Nashar, the founder of SeedStartup. ''It's a higher risk we're taking, because we're investing in essentially nothing.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs who enter the program are required to spend three months in Dubai, where they are mentored by SeedStartup and given an opportunity to pitch their ideas to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, entrepreneurship has become a buzzword in the Arab world, operating on the credo that business is an essential engine for social, economic and eventually political progress in the region. The region is also under pressure to generate jobs to employ one of the largest youth populations in the world: half of its people are under 25 and 26.4 percent are unemployed, according to the International Labor Organization. The I.L.O. predicts that youth unemployment rates in the region will rise to 28.4 percent in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2011 report by the Arab youth employment initiative Silatech and the Gallup polling institute showed that the greatest problems for young Arabs in high-income countries like the U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, were related to entrepreneurship issues. Their concerns suggest that potential new business creators in these countries view government regulations as an obstacle to their ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Entrepreneurship must remain in the forefront of discussion for it to be continuously discussed at a policy-making level. I agree that if an individual left from a certain city in the Middle East to the United States he could realize his dream faster,'' said Ahmad Bin Byat, the chairman of du, one of two U.A.E. telecommunications operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The youth of today do not have the same mind-set as the youth of the pre-oil era,'' said Mr. Bin Byat. ''The appetite for risk has greatly reduced, and most of the current youth are happy with jobs. I hope that attitude changes and we see more enterprise and innovation from the youth of today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship, du has launched a television show on the local channel Dubai One.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Entrepreneur,'' which opened on Oct. 3, started with about 100 contestants, including 33 women. A jury of local business personalities whittled down the contenders in the first two weekly episodes to produce a short list of 10 finalists, including two women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next two months, the finalists will be eliminated one by one to produce a winner, who will earn a 1 million dirham, or $272,000, prize to jump-start his, or her, business plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An oft-heard lament within the region's entrepreneur ecosystem is the Arab world's failure to produce a Steven P. Jobs or an <span class="companylink">Infosys</span>, the Indian outsourcing services giant. Companies are either large institutions dependent on state support or smaller enterprises with limited access to capital and talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why is the region lacking innovation? Let's take the U.A.E., which is a consumer-oriented society. It has basic services -- although very well managed -- but if someone wanted to innovate and invent, is this local market ready to accept it? Start-ups tend to look locally, but they must be more ambitious, aim regionally and even globally, because the local market is just not big enough,'' said Evangelos Lianos, an executive vice-president at Etisalat, the older of the two Emirates telecom operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, setting up a business in the U.A.E. is fairly easy, especially within any one of the numerous free zones that eliminate the legal requirement for a majority-stake local business partner and thus permit full ownership; a start-up launched out of a garage or basement, however, is not the sort of legend one is likely to hear of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''License fees and linking business set-up to real estate space are definitely challenges for start-ups in the region,'' Mr. El-Nashar of SeedStartup said. ''Virtual office options are available, and although they are cheaper than settling for a physical office, still come attached with basic fees that are more expensive than in the West,'' he added. ''Entrepreneurs, especially technology start-ups, are looking to minimize risks and find a formula that works. That's the kind of business climate the region needs to encourage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicholas Holmes, a former management consultant at <span class="companylink">Accenture</span>, founded MediaGraph, one of the seven projects selected by Mr. Nashar for Seed-Startup. Mr. Holmes described his company as ''an online public relations service designed to facilitate high-quality contact between small and medium businesses and members of the media.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dubai is similar to London in many senses. It has high rents, high living costs, high labor costs for skilled workers -- all those things can kill a start-up,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's lacking compared to London, of course, is a developed entrepreneurial ecosystem. But nobody can doubt that huge efforts are being made to change that, with new accelerators popping up, workspaces such as Make and much more attention being paid to entrepreneurialism in general thanks to those famous success stories -- the Dubizzles and Cobones of the world,'' Mr. Holmes said. Dubizzle, an online classified advertising business and Cobones, a group-buying Web site, are both based in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Culturally, emphasis is placed on safer education and career choices and discouraging risk-taking. ''The policies in place are probably a reflection of the cultural stigma associated with the fear of failure. A change in policies would doubtless help change cultural taboos,'' said Mr. Lianos. Bankruptcy is considered a criminal offence in several countries; a bounced check in the Emirates can land a person in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope 'The Entrepreneur' will be a catalyst of change,'' said Mr. Bin Byat. ''It is a completely U.A.E.-developed, produced and supported show, and I think will raise some important issues that could result in positive developments.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KAMPALA, UGANDA -- Far too often, in the view of Africa's budding female entrepreneurs, their continent is characterized as the recipient of aid that enables residents just to struggle by, and as a place that mistreats and marginalizes its women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in 2010, after a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the United Nations' special rapporteur on sexual violence called that country the ''rape capital of the world.'' Last month, a South African politician named her own country the ''rape capital of the world.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data analysis from <span class="companylink">Google</span> shows that since 2004, the most common single term related to searches from the United States for ''Africa'' has been ''AIDS.'' This year, the charity Save the Children named Niger the ''worst place to be a mother.'' On the United Nations' Web site, Africa is the only continent listed under ''Issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was into this world, and against it, says Bethlehem Tilahun, that her shoe company SoleRebels was born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I kept hearing over and over the phrase 'poverty alleviation,''' said Ms. Tilahun, now a footwear mogul whose company grossed $2 million in sales this past year. ''The media, preoccupied with a singular narrative about 'Africa' that missed the story of Africa -- part of a larger spectrum of endless entities that have monopolized Africa's image, our brand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With SoleRebels, she said proudly, ''We've inverted the whole paradigm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tilahun, 33, is one of a cresting wave of African entrepreneurs who are harnessing Africa's businesses and brands as the continent enjoys its greatest economic success in generations. The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> now forecasts, admittedly in a recession-plagued world, that Africa will have the fastest-growing economy of any continent over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new entrepreneurs of Africa are women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tilahun became one with shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in 2004 as a recent college graduate in Ethiopia with a handful of artisans from the neighborhood and a workshop on her grandmother's plot, Ms. Tilahun has built SoleRebels (pun-intended) from a handmade sandal shop into a multimillion-dollar enterprise, whose iconic footwear -- still handmade and eco-friendly -- sells abroad for $60 and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now her company employs roughly 100 workers, and it recently opened its flagship store in central Addis Ababa, where SoleRebels' Ethiopian-branded fusion of Abyssinian and Western taste is on display. With each pair of shoes, she said, she seeks to change people's minds about Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've flipped the concept of non-Africans writing the script,'' Ms. Tilahun went on. ''We've basically taken back control of our destiny by controlling the marketing message.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Africa may not be as badly off as indexes sometimes imply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> report released this month, more than 20 sub-Saharan African countries, totaling more than 400 million people, have gained middle-income status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> said, one-third of the economies of the 49 sub-Saharan African countries will grow at a clip of 6 percent or more; meanwhile, the number of people living in poverty has fallen roughly 10 percentage points over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has as much, or more, to do with trade as aid. And it is compounding a surge of female entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Women in the private sector represent a powerful source of economic growth and opportunity,'' said Marcelo Giugale, the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>'s director for poverty reduction and economic management for Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Africa, you see women working a lot,'' noted Markus Goldstein, a development economist in the gender department of the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> in Washington. ''They are very active in the labor market.'' According to <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> data, nearly two-thirds of women are participating in Africa's labor force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women doing business in ways that support families include the myriad cross-border traders found throughout sub-Saharan Africa; women selling used clothes and tin kitchenware; hair stylists; and owners of fashion salons, small food stores and even watering holes (catering almost exclusively to men).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are all businesses that are seen as more traditional. In 21st-century Africa, businesswomen are pushing into the national scenes of their countries as movers and shakers of industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Africa, Sibongile Sambo has been a pioneer for women in aviation. She leads an exclusive charter-aircraft company. In Kenya, Ory Okello, 23, helped found <span class="companylink">Ushahidi</span> , a Web 2.0 crowdsourcing software initiative that changed the game in real-time tracking of emergency events via cyberspace. It was originally geared toward political violence after Kenya's bloody presidential election in 2008, and now is used by <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nigeria, Adenike Ogunlesi has built a regional children's clothing empire from scratch -- she started by selling pajamas out of the trunk of her car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lakeside Uganda, Lovin Kobusingya has brought fish sausages to the dining table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always knew I was a businesswoman,'' said Ms. Kobusingye, 29, a mother of two. ''When I was in high school, I used to sell illegal sweets. And I made money. I made a lot of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her company, Kati Fish Farms, sells 500 kilograms, or about 1,100 pounds, of fish sausage a day, and moves 8 tons of fish a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am very happy and proud'' at being a female entrepreneur, she said. ''When I was young, they said: 'A woman is a woman -- a man should take care of you.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But women are actually contributing a lot more than men. We always find ourselves multitasking,'' she said, between working and raising a family. ''If it could be equated in terms of currency, it would be 80 percent of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of female entrepreneurship is higher in Africa than in any other region of the world, the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> says. And even African countries criticized for abuses of human rights and civil liberties are progressive on gender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may not be a coincidence that a number of Africa's economies doing the best without many resources -- like Ethiopia or Rwanda -- have austere, orderly, patriotic, aid-efficient governments that simultaneously spurn charity aid and focus on foreign-direct investment and private enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rwanda, a change in land-title laws to allow wives to be registered alongside their husbands led to a nearly 20 percent increase in female-registered farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Ethiopia and Rwanda have been criticized for restrictions on civil liberties yet have also given birth to targeted marketing of U.S. consumers -- including Rwanda's Bourbon coffee chain and Ms. Tilahun's SoleRebels -- efforts that may help alter Africa's image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As I entered college,'' Ms. Tilahun noted, ''it had become clear to me that 'poverty alleviation' is a myth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People don't want to be 'not poor,' they want some form of prosperity. That doesn't mean millionaires or billionaires, but prosperous,'' Ms. Tilahun said. ''And to create prosperity you have to create something world class.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She started with the basics -- fibers. These have been part of survival and ingenuity in Ethiopia -- along with China, India and Egypt, one of the world's most ancient civilizations. ''Footwear was an excellent platform,'' she said. SoleRebels footwear -- including shoes, sandals and slippers -- is made from a variety of hand-woven, locally made materials, including recycled car tires and traditionally grown koba fiber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, her company used new thread types and weave designs, revamping customer service to incorporate Ethiopia's culture of hospitality. As a woman growing up and working in Ethiopia, she said, there were people who tried to limit her because of her gender, ''but I never felt any limitations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, she felt that she was doing something genuine -- ''people want their brands to be real,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As her shoes have caught on, so has an image of Africa that consumers are willing to buy, and not simply fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SoleRebels has become one of Africa's best-known shoe companies, its products advertised in hip magazines from Toronto to Berlin. Consumers and investors from donor-aid nations have responded. Ms. Tilahun was named by Forbes magazine as one of 100 women to watch in 2012 and invited to speak at the 2011 <span class="companylink">World Economic Forum</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an ''urgent need,'' she said, to create more African-owned brands delivering world-class products to the global market, to drown out charitable organizations ''selling their variety of messages about and images of Africa.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's face it,'' she said, ''it's pretty hard to convince someone to buy what you are selling when someone else has convinced them you are solely occupied with swatting away flies from your face.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like a recipe for success for a new start-up: Two famed entrepreneurs, tens of millions of dollars in the bank and endorsements from celebrities like Alicia Keys and Jim Carrey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Airtime, the much-hyped video chat site created by Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning, the two behind the music sharing service Napster, has turned out to be far from a sure thing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is just four months old, and the staff is tweaking its features to make it more appealing. So far, though, Airtime's traffic appears to be little more than a trickle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the latest bits of news about the company -- it has lost some important employees and laid off others -- do not bode well for its future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airtime's still-unfolding story reflects the challenges for any start-up, regardless of pedigree, in winning over users when so many other sites, apps and services are vying for their attention. And it shows how hard it can be to spin viral magic out of thin air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bing Gordon, a board member at Airtime and a partner at <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, one of the venture capital firms that backed the company, said users tended to be fickle, impatient and difficult to dazzle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The average life cycle of an app is way down,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''People are always ready to move on to the next thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Airtime, Mr. Gordon said he believed two-way video would become a more important medium over time, because it conveys emotions that a text or phone call cannot capture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Mr. Parker and his team would just have to keep trying until they got it right: ''They are on that journey.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker rejected the idea that Airtime was struggling. He said there was a dedicated core of people who used it regularly, and he pointed out that the company was still getting its bearings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a ridiculously early stage for a company,'' Mr. Parker said in an interview on Monday at his town house in New York. ''It takes six to 12 months to get things up and running.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker said the company was moving most of its operations from San Francisco to New York, which would help the business by taking advantage of engineers and designers on the East Coast. The company is also working on a mobile version of the service, as well as features that will let people chat with multiple friends simultaneously, rather than just one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the criticism lobbed at the company came in response to its over-the-top introduction -- a star-studded event at a studio in Manhattan, complete with fancy hors d'oeuvres. Mr. Parker said he wanted to grab the attention of those who were not <span class="companylink">avid technology</span> users and reel in a big group of the curious on the first day. The lingering scrutiny of the company was an ''unintended consequence,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airtime declined to give specifics about its user numbers other than to say that early traffic was ''very compelling.'' AppData, a service that collects data about sites and services that connect with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, indicated that Airtime had just 400 users a day and 10,000 over the course of a month, but Mr. Parker and other executives at the company suggested those figures were off. Nielsen and comScore, two independent analytics firms, both said that traffic to Airtime was so small that it did not yet register on their charts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker said Airtime was monitoring how people were using the service and was adding new features, like the ability to leave recorded video responses. He said it was similar to his early days at other companies, including Spotify, the business networking service Plaxo and even <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But part of the problem is that Internet users are not likely to stick around while a new company figures out its direction -- something Mr. Parker is working to combat. ''I knew we wouldn't have tremendous growth right off the bat with a one-to-one video service,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airtime has adjusted its approach several times since its release. It was first marketed as a family-friendly version of Chatroulette, which became a big hit in 2009 by connecting strangers for video chat, but fizzled after being swamped by nudity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker and Mr. Fanning were in talks to buy out Chatroulette's creator, Andrey Ternovskiy, who was then 17 years old, but when that did not work out, the two decided to build their own version, according to Mr. Parker and Mr. Fanning. Mr. Ternovskiy did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airtime raised its first financing in 2010, but did not come up with a viable product until after it bought Erly, a photo-sharing company started by early <span class="companylink">Hulu</span> employees. The first iteration of the Airtime site was unveiled in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Mr. Parker replaced Mr. Fanning as chief executive. Mr. Fanning is on the board and said he was still involved with the company as a product adviser. ''Aside from my family, this is my No. 1 job,'' he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a user signs up for Airtime through <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, the service analyzes the user's profile and pairs him or her with willing strangers who have similar interests. They can then chat and watch <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos together. Airtime can also be used as a simple way to video chat with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friends. Since its introduction the service has rapidly introduced features to let people leave each other video messages and get video reactions to items they post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker said the company had whittled its staff down to about a dozen people, but would not say how many employees the company had at the unveiling. He said those who had been let go were largely customer support staff hired to moderate video chats. The company has also lost Eric Feng, the founder of Erly and the former chief technical officer of Hulu, who oversaw the building of the Airtime site. Mr. Parker said his departure had been planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airtime raised $33.5 million from an all-star roster of investors, which in addition to <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span> included Andreessen Horowitz, SV Angel, Founders Fund, <span class="companylink">Google Ventures</span> and celebrities like Ashton Kutcher. Mr. Parker insisted that the company was still well-financed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than the success of this start-up is at stake for Mr. Parker, who has a reputation for spotting the next big thing and helping to usher it into the mainstream. His early involvement in Napster, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Spotify means that people in the industry are watching to see whether he succeeds with Airtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker acknowledges that his involvement has ramped up the pressure on Airtime. He insisted that he was not concerned about his stature in the technology world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I were worried about my reputation, I wouldn't do anything with start-ups,'' he said. ''It's always a series of trials, always painful to start a company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Airtime may not have attracted an instant crowd, video chatting is catching on among younger users, travelers and families who rely on it to keep in touch. Analysts think it is only a matter of time before it gains wider appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The entire history of communication has been trying to approximate the experience of being face-to-face when you are not in the same room,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Forrester Research</span>. ''But the path to getting there is littered with dozens of failures and more to come along the way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still drawbacks to video conversations. People must be ready to jump into a chat and give callers their undivided attention, something that is practically unheard-of in an era of multitasking on smartphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, there are some big successes. Skype, the audio- and video-calling service owned by <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, says it has 254 million monthly users. OoVoo, a free service that lets up to 12 people video chat at the same time, had 9.2 million visitors in the United States in August, according to Nielsen. Mr. McQuivey of Forrester said it would soon be very easy for anyone to video chat, in part because major technology companies are pushing the idea. Amazon is building cameras into its latest Kindle Fire tablets. Apple has FaceTime on its devices, and <span class="companylink">Google</span> has a tool called Hangouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the big tech titans are going after it, but as a feature of their existing products,'' he said. ''You don't have to sign up or pay for it -- it's just part of the experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker disagreed that video chat was just a feature. ''You need a network of people to use it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could be a little too late or even a little too early,'' Mr. Parker said. ''But hopefully we'll be like Goldilocks and time it just right.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - When Hiroki Takeuchi joined <span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Company</span> in 2008, he had a front-row seat to the upheaval in finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, Mr. Takeuchi, a 26-year-old Oxford graduate, worked with some of the world's biggest banks trying to figure out how to adjust to new regulations and a changed market. Then he quit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Takeuchi, memories of friends building successful start-ups at college outweighed the lucrative rewards offered by the blue-chip consulting firm. He joined forces with two McKinsey consultants, feverishly writing code out of his parents' house on a minimal budget to create his own technology start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was GoCardless, a London-based company that allows small businesses to set up monthly payments to suppliers at a fraction of the cost that banks charge. The business has secured $1.5 million in seed capital from a number of well-known investors, including the American early-stage venture capital firm Y Combinator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The whole idea of bank payments is broken," said Mr. Takeuchi at the start-up's office in a dilapidated building on the outskirts of London's financial district. "There's an opportunity here, and we're looking to grab it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London's fast-growing start-up scene is trying to disrupt the financial status quo. As consumers' trust in banks deteriorates because of a series of recent scandals, young companies are pressing their newcomer advantage. Firms are offering services like low-cost foreign currency exchange and new ways for small business to borrow cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backed by venture capital firms like <span class="companylink">Index Ventures</span>, the financial start-ups are taking on entrenched incumbents by using technology to pare back costs and improve the customer experience. Local authorities do not directly regulate many of the firms, but the young companies often use traditional banks and other financial firms for their back-office functions, like processing payments, which are monitored by British regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Start-ups are taking advantage of London's position as a global financial center," said Adam Valkin, a partner at the European venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>. "They are innovating in ways that banks just can't do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of finance entrepreneurs comes as London's start-up community continues to flourish. Many parts of East London have transformed into a mini version of Silicon Valley, with the likes of <span class="companylink">Google</span> opening shared office space to support fledgling companies. Finance, technology and fashion start-ups have been able to tap into the large talent pool of young, multilingual professionals eager to work for the firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies are following the lead of <span class="companylink">Wonga.com</span>, an online lender founded in 2006 that has sought to fill a void left by banks by offering short-term, high-interest loans to consumers and small businesses. The company has been criticized for charging high interest rates to vulnerable consumers. The typical annual percentage rate on the company's loans is more than 4,000 percent, though <span class="companylink">Wonga.com</span> says it only offers lending for a maximum of 30 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cut down on costs, the start-up relies on publicly available online data to determine whether an applicant is creditworthy. Loans can take as little as 15 minutes to arrange, and the company has branched out from consumer lending into the small-business market as individuals look for alternatives to banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tactics are paying off. Last year, the online lender reported a 269 percent rise in its net profit, to £45.8 million, or $73 million, after its loans increased fourfold compared with the previous year. Now, Wonga is now contemplating a multibillion-dollar initial public offering on Nasdaq, profiting from lending to consumers that are perceived as too risky for banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many workers in London's financial services sector, successes like Wonga have turned the idea of starting a business into an increasingly attractive option. With investment banking activities on the wane, job prospects in the industry have remained poor since the beginning of the financial crisis, and the financial sector here is expected to lose 25,000 jobs this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anil Stocker has seen the layoffs up close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stocker, a 28-year-old Cambridge graduate, left <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> a few months before it collapsed in 2008. A year later, he resigned from the American investment bank <span class="companylink">Cogent Partners</span> to co-found <span class="companylink">MarketInvoice</span> with two friends who worked at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up helps small businesses gain access to capital by selling their supplier invoices to investors at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The finance industry will have to completely change, and we are just at the beginning," Mr. Stocker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">MarketInvoice</span> wants to exploit an underserved market in the banking sector. As firms have pulled back on lending, small business have been denied credit because they are deemed too much of a financial risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help these companies access cash, Mr. Stocker and his partners began an online marketplace where small businesses can auction their long-term supply contracts to money managers for the highest price. Many of these invoices can take up to 90 days to pay out, so companies are willing to sell them at a discount to get hold of short-term capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting the business has not been easy. It took <span class="companylink">MarketInvoice</span>'s founders - who were still working for banks - almost a year to devise the business plan, and a further six months to raise $1.4 million from investors. The start-up auctioned its first supplier contract for £40,000, or $64,000, in early 2011, but only hit the £1 million mark nine months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one wanted to be the first company to use our system," Mr. Stocker said. "At the beginning, you live or die by your reputation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London's finance start-ups also are attracting entrepreneurs with a technology background.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taavet Hinrikus, a 31-year-old Estonian who was Skype's first employee, dreamed up his business while still working for the Internet calling service. In 2006, the company moved him to London from Tallinn, Estonia, where he rose to become Skype's director of strategy. But Mr. Hinrikus grew frustrated after losing 5 percent of his salary to bank charges every time he moved money from Estonia to Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting fellow compatriots in London who wanted to transfer cash back Estonia, Mr. Hinrikus created a system in which individuals could move money to each other's accounts. By agreeing to swap currencies at a set rate, Mr. Hinrikus said he saved thousands of dollars in bank fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had to find our own way to avoid the charges," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his business partner, Kristo Kaarmann, a former management consultant, Mr. Hinrikus built a Web site that connects people looking to exchange British pounds with euros. Their start-up, called TransferWise, acts as an intermediary for the money transfers and has expanded into other European currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everything has gone to plan. The start-up had to wait 18 months to receive its license to operate from British regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in its first 12 months, Mr. Hinrikus said TransferWise has helped people to exchange around $10 million of foreign currencies that has avoided costly bank charges. The start-up also has raised $1.3 million in seed capital from investors, including <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>'s co-founder Max Levchin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Banks aren't doing a good job at innovating for consumers," said Robert Dighero, a partner in the London-based venture capital firm Passion Capital. "Start-ups are nibbling away at some of their most profitable businesses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a booth with a wooden table, three entrepreneurs are nervously practicing pitches for investors in front of a camera.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At white desks spread across the open work space, people are noisily typing on laptops or holding brainstorming meetings. Some simply gaze off into space searching for inspiration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Make Business Hub might look like a student hangout, but it is one of the new urban work spaces that are somewhere between high-technology incubators and coffee shops and that have become red-hot attractions in the United Arab Emirates. They cater to entrepreneurs, freelancers and the self-employed who do not have offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than working from their bedrooms in bathrobes or at a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> next to mothers with screaming toddlers, mobile workers are instead turning to spaces like Make, the Pavilion, and the Shelter to collaborate and work in peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The environment encourages interaction and lets us connect with potential partners and customers really easily,'' said Nicholas Holmes, co-founder of MediaGraph, a public relations start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's also motivating to know everyone around you is working -- often on their own ventures -- as opposed to sitting in an isolated office or a random cafe,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic changes that came with the political uprisings during the Arab Spring have helped energize a start-up culture in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed by an urgent need to create jobs in a region with some of the highest unemployment rates in the world, young people began developing their own small businesses and online ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two years, the requisite ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors and legal and regulatory changes has begun to jell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oasis500 in Jordan is investing $30 million in 500 start-ups by 2014 in an effort to cultivate an entrepreneurial scene. Dubai has issued regulations to support the creation of small and midsize enterprises, this year alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a part of the world where success is thought of as finding a stable, full-time job as a lawyer, the popularity of these new work spaces indicates a new cultural acceptance of entrepreneurial activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shelter was the first space dedicated to mobile workers that opened last year in Al Serkal Avenue, Dubai's fashionable art center tucked into a hodgepodge of warehouses, cranes and dusty garages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shelter offers free use of desks and the Internet, as well as inexpensive coffee. Sponsorship by a telecommunications company, du, covers regular expenses like rent and utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the U.A.E., registered businesses rent offices and run up a lot of expenses, so we're here to cater to the entrepreneur who is just starting out and uses our communal space instead of their own apartment,'' said Mary Ames, a spokeswoman for the Shelter in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They tend to be more creative and productive here, rather than working on their own, and it's a money thing, too,'' she said. ''We don't even pester them to buy coffee.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shelter, open daily from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m., offers entrepreneurs a place to work, and frequently is host to free workshops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, The Shelter was host to a free panel discussion on mobile applications, sponsored by BlackBerry, with details on matters like funding and design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space can also be rented out for private or corporate events for a fee -- a profitable activity because of The Shelter's location within Dubai's art hub. Gallery owners often hold meetings in the space and many of the start-ups are of a creative nature, like that by a British team working on a funky graphic design company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pavilion, which opened in February 2011, is even more chic. On one side of the room is a library-like setting for mobile workers, including a long wooden table surrounded by bookshelves, couches and beanbag chairs. On another, there is an art gallery with exhibitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managed by the same team as The Shelter, The Pavilion offers free Internet and desk space for mobile workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sponsorship by a real estate developer, Emaar, covers regular expenses -- and corporate events are very profitable. Chanel and <span class="companylink">Google</span> often rent out space for private events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, <span class="companylink">Google</span> was host to a conference at The Pavilion about <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> growth in the region and an event for members of Wamda, an online network for regional entrepreneurs, at Make, rather than in its office in the area known as Media City in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a company committed to innovation, the exchange of ideas is essential in creating a successful, collaborative working environment,'' said Maha Abouelenein, a Google spokeswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found that Make and The Pavilion were consistent with that ethos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees of technology companies based in Dubai, including <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span>, like to spend a day working at these spaces for a change of pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love our offices, but change is healthy,'' said Yamen Al-Hajjar, a <span class="companylink">Google</span> employee in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the customers at Make, which had an informal opening in January, are employees at companies. Some are craving inspiration outside the office, like Mr. Al-Hajjar, while others use the space as a base in Dubai when they also work in other emirates or countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's where I go when I'm out of the office and or have meetings in Dubai,'' said Hamed Parnian, an employee of Aqaar, a real estate developer in the northern emirate of Ajman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the local infrastructure improves, we'll see Dubai moving in a similar direction to cities like London that have opened up the concept of the traditional working environment. This is a first step.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other customers are entrepreneurs, like Mr. Holmes of MediaGraph, who took part in an accelerator program in Dubai called SeedStartup, which mentored start-ups at Make for three months last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While I was developing the concept, Pavilion opened and I was one of the first to use the space,'' said Leith Matthews, founder of Make. ''It gave me added confidence that this idea of catering to the mobile work community is a legitimate business opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within two months, he raised 1.8 million dirhams or about $490,000 for the business idea, investing 300,000 dirhams of his own funds, with an official opening on Feb. 13. He limited his marketing to social media.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill de Blasio was pacing the conference room, listening to small-business owners in Long Island City, Queens, bemoaning municipal red tape, when he relayed the tale of a frustrated laundromat owner whose water bill was inflated, erroneously, by an extra zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The system is not based on trying to give you a ready, available opportunity to appeal, or a fair way to actually make sure that all the facts are looked at,'' Mr. de Blasio said, prompting a few ''Yes! Yes!'' incantations reminiscent of a Sunday service. ''Let me ask -- how many people in this room have seen their water bills go up sharply in the last year? Raise your hand.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up rocketed a dozen or so arms, vindication for Mr. de Blasio, who has increasingly made amplifying the concerns of small-business owners a cornerstone of his expected campaign for mayor of New York, and a cudgel with which to critique not only Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg but also one of his probable rivals in the Democratic primary, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker. He does not have the bully pulpit or the historic candidacy that have allowed Ms. Quinn to garner much of the attention thus far, but he is also freer to run with the voice of a populist outsider, despite having held public office for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio, the city's public advocate, has sharpened his pitch since a reporter first tagged along with him six months ago. He now stokes audiences by noting that, after hearing complaints at forums, he filed a lawsuit recently against the Bloomberg administration for data on city revenues from fines, which have nearly doubled in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If small-business people in this city did not have those additional burdens, if they could depend on not being socked with those additional charges, it would be easier for them to grow, it would be easier for them to employ more people -- it's as simple as that,'' he said at the forum, held at LaGuardia Community College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio is also deploying more sarcasm. Asked by one businessman about the confusing signs governing the proliferating bicycle lanes that eat up parking spaces for delivery vehicles, a frequent topic, he quipped: ''You obviously missed a new law that says all signs have to be in hieroglyphics now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when someone vented about the time-consuming frustrations of challenging certain fines, Mr. de Blasio replied, ''I want to say, in defense of the Environmental Control Board, they are slightly more fair than the Spanish Inquisition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio's de facto five-borough listening tour, largely under the auspices of his day job as public advocate, has echoes of the early stages of Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2000 Senate race, which he managed. Yet Mr. de Blasio dismisses the suggestion that his sojourns are part of a long-term realpolitik to enhance his mayoral prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is how I did things long before I became public advocate,'' said Mr. de Blasio, a longtime Brooklyn resident who previously represented Park Slope on the Council. ''You need a feedback loop to be an effective public servant, and you need to refresh it all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a visit in June 2011 to a preschool in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Mr. de Blasio marveled at the advanced curriculum being taught to underprivileged children. That experience shaped his much-discussed proposal earlier this month to tax the wealthiest New Yorkers to bolster early education -- a suggestion that Mayor Bloomberg promptly dismissed as ''dumb.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a round-table discussion in January with the Bronx Chamber of Commerce attended by about 15 small-business owners, Mr. de Blasio got an earful about excessive and inaccurate water bills. Seven months later, he convened a public hearing, the first by a public advocate on any issue in recent memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most frequent complaints Mr. de Blasio hears is about traffic and parking, and he can relate to them, because he usually drives himself to events. So now, with more than 36,000 miles on his two-year-old city-issued Ford Escape hybrid, he has no shortage of stories about battling traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway (''That's where schedules go to die'') or dialing 311 (''I call in when I see a traffic light not working'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the mayor, the bullpen is the center of the universe,'' Mr. de Blasio said during a recent drive to Queens, his headset draped over his head, and pink Spalding balls nearby. ''For me, it's being out in the neighborhoods, and overwhelmingly in the outer boroughs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No event appears to be too small. Such was the case when he attended a recent lunch meeting of the <span class="companylink">Greater Jamaica Development Corporation</span> with six people, including two longtime Queens political insiders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio zeroed in on the tax status of the development corporation, a nonprofit organization whose finances have been questioned. The corporation's annual tax bill jumped from $600,000 to $1.5 million after the Bloomberg administration revoked the tax-exempt status of parking garages it operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously we want to help,'' Mr. de Blasio said, adding that he was considering a broader idea to help nonprofit groups. ''You can't make some of this stuff up.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retirement funds are being used increasingly for anything but retirement. Instead, 401(k)'s and individual retirement accounts are becoming money pots used to invest in business start-ups, speculate in gold and buy private equity investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such maneuvers come with big tax advantages. But they may also leave their users penniless in retirement, while their ability to evade taxes can cost the government.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My interest was piqued by a recent ad in an airline magazine. It called on people to leave their mind-numbing jobs and use their retirement funds to start a franchise business. Invest in yourself was the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was startled at the directness. I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s were never meant to be used to start a business. After 15 minutes on the Internet - one of the few upsides to air travel these days - I discovered armies of advisers willing to charge a fee to help you use your 401(k) or I.R.A. to start a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of leaders in this nascent industry is Guidant Financial. You can get an idea of what this is about from its Web site, which asserts that "by rolling your existing retirement funds into an iFinance plan you can invest in a small business or franchise inside your retirement plan ... without tax penalties!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategies to do so and not run afoul of I.R.S. regulations are varied, but the main one is to start a business and have it adopt a 401(k) plan. The existing 401(k) plan is rolled into the new one, which is invested in the new business. Voilà - instant financing. The downside, however, is that there is no money for retirement if the business fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is evidence that most of these businesses do fail. The <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> terms one form of this scheme as a Rollovers as Business Start-Ups plan, or perhaps with some unintended irony, a ROBS plan. In 2009, the I.R.S. studied ROBS plans and found that most of these businesses had gone bankrupt, losing the person's retirement savings. In most cases the money was lost before the business even got off the ground. Nonetheless, the I.R.S. does not prohibit ROBS plans, but it has called for more scrutiny of the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has not diminished the ardor of franchisers and other investment advisers selling such plans. They aggressively market them to would-be entrepreneurs. Figures are hard to come by, but the chief executive and co-founder of Guidant, David Nilssen, recently told The New York Times that inquiries about these types of plans were up 196 percent in 2011 from 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this is not the only way use your retirement fund for something other than prudent retirement planning. A business even bigger than self-financing a start-up is the self-directed I.R.A. As of 2011, some $94 billion was invested in these plans, according to the Investment Company Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-directed I.R.A.'s allow for speculation in much sexier investments, like gold bullion, oil and loans. But that is only the beginning. Want to own a rental home? You can do that through your I.R.A. How about cattle or llamas? You can do that, too. There's even the case of someone who bought musical instruments using a retirement fund and rented them out for tax-free income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the biggest growth area in alternative retirement fund investing is commodities. Gold I.R.A.'s are particularly popular, and one of the largest advisers in this area, the Entrust Group, recently stated that the value of these holdings at the firm had grown by more than five times in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This brings us to another oft-promoted feature of these funds, assuming the investments work out. Self-directed I.R.A.'s are great tax shelters because the money inside it, like money in a regular I.R.A. or 401(k), is untaxed until withdrawn. These plans offer tax savings that regular investors cannot get because they defer taxes for decades. And if the investments are made through a Roth I.R.A., the gains are completely tax-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitt Romney's experience illustrates the effectiveness of this strategy. When he was at Bain, he funneled his private equity investments into a tax-sheltered retirement fund, investing an unknown amount, but likely about $450,000. That amount is now worth $20.7 million to $101.6 million. All of this gain has been tax-free, so far. Entrust, by the way, has an article on its Web site that promotes self-directed I.R.A.'s, citing Mr. Romney's use of them to shelter up to $100 million in gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the tax on capital gains rises in coming years, and marketing by these alternative investment firms grows, expect more entrepreneurs and investors to turn to their retirement funds for this type of extreme investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these investors will succeed, and these lucky few will pay fewer taxes because of the use of these retirement plans, costing the government money that could total billions. Originally, the idea was that the tax-free nature of this investment was justified to encourage saving for retirement. But that is not what is going on here. Buying mass quantities of gold? This is nothing but speculation. And as is the case with most speculation, the average investor is not likely to make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Romney, of course, as a top private equity executive, knew what he was doing and could afford the loss if things had gone wrong. But the average investor speculating with I.R.A. funds or concentrating them into one investment or a start-up is asking for trouble. There are no statistics on how self-directed I.R.A.'s have performed, but there is no reason to expect that investors in gold and cattle will do any better than those who have day-traded with their retirement funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the fraud issue. Self-directed I.R.A.'s have been a particular target of Ponzi schemes, causing the North American Securities Administration Association to issue a special alert. In the most prominent case of recent note, the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> stopped a number of schemes trying to persuade retirees to buy promissory notes in Turkish investments - yes, Turkish promissory notes - through self-directed I.R.A.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that all of this activity is for anything but retirement is a case study in how legitimate tax policies can be distorted and rules bent to benefit the inventive. More sadly, though, is that a whole industry growing around these investments also shows how some Americans are willing to risk anything for a big jackpot in the markets. And how under the current system, if they succeed, they can do it tax-free, while the rest of us pay taxes.</p>

But mission-driven companies like Sustainable Harvest, FEED Projects and BeadforLife offer an alternative: distinctive artisanal products that also finance antipoverty efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How these socially conscious companies bring their coffee, tote bags and beads to market can vary. Some, like BeadforLife, go the traditional nonprofit route, while others, like FEED Projects, opt for the profit-making model in hopes of speedier growth.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest option is to be certified as a <span class="companylink">B Corp</span>, or benefit corporation. A concept introduced five years ago by a group of entrepreneurs, <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> certification is ''like the Fair Trade label but for a whole company, not just a bag of coffee,'' said Jay Coen Gilbert, a co-founder of B Lab, a nonprofit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization certifies companies once they have met standards of social and environmental performance and have changed their bylaws to take into account the impact of their decisions on the environment, community and employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve states have enacted laws -- called benefit corporation legislation -- recognizing them as an alternative corporate form with the freedom and obligation to produce ''a material positive impact on society and the environment,'' according to B Lab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The certification allows social entrepreneurs who run profit-making companies the opportunity to be more transparent about their goals that don't involve the bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Increasingly there are businesses that want to create value for all their stakeholders, not just their shareholders,'' said Andrew Kassoy, another of B Lab's founders. ''These companies are competing not just to be best in the world, but best for the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 650 companies have embraced the status so far, including Patagonia, the outdoor clothing company, and Etsy, the e-commerce site for craft entrepreneurs. Most recently, Ben &amp; Jerry's, one of the original socially driven companies, which was bought 12 years ago by <span class="companylink">Unilever</span>, announced in October that it had obtained <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> certification, making it the first wholly owned subsidiary of a publicly traded company to receive the status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kassoy called the Ben &amp; Jerry's news a ''big deal,'' and applauded <span class="companylink">Unilever</span> for a decision that he hoped would ''influence other multinationals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Griswold, the founder of Sustainable Harvest, a Portland-based coffee importer, said Ben &amp; Jerry's had inspired him 20 years ago when as a young and idealistic entrepreneur he first visited its founders with a ''bag of coffee beans and a slide show.'' As one of the first C.E.O.'s to apply for <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> status, he seems proud to learn that the two businesses continue to share the same values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm looking forward to seeing how their new <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> affiliation validates and adds momentum to this growing movement,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griswold established Sustainable Harvest as a business, like any other, in 1997. ''I saw many impressive nonprofits doing good work, but they seemed challenged to reach scale,'' he recalled, noting the need, especially in the beginning, to invest ''significant'' amounts in his company's mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was only when my company grew, and I began to reinvest my earnings in coffee communities abroad, that I saw I could really make a difference.'' He said he felt that a nonprofit business model would have slowed down his progress. He wouldn't have been able to bring together growers (farmers overseas) and roasters (businesses usually based in the United States) without a profit motive for both, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the business wasn't all about profit for Mr. Griswold. Other goals were to educate farmers and improve their communities, like supporting the construction of a medical clinic in a Guatemalan village that provided the beans for one of his prestige clients, Dillanos. He wanted to relay the message to customers and donors that helping his growers was as important to him as selling gourmet coffee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For him, <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> certification was the answer. Mr. Griswold said that in 2008 he saw one of the founders speak at an event in Portland, and he signed up immediately. ''The idea of changing the bylaws of your corporation really appealed to me,'' he said. Mr. Griswold said that his <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> status gives his company ''some legitimacy'' when dealing with foundations that want to support his business -- a sort of street cred in the nonprofit world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is it really necessary for a business to be certified as a <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> to have an impact on the greater good? The certification process can be expensive; it costs $500 to $25,000 a year depending on a company's annual sales. And the label -- similar to the Fair Trade designation on food and other products to promote higher social and environmental standards, or LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for buildings -- is arguably still window dressing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lauren Bush Lauren, co-founder of FEED Projects, a company that sells products and donates a percentage of its profits to world hunger initiatives, doesn't yet see the need to certify her company. ''This is in theory what FEED Projects already is,'' she said. ''But we're not at a point where we're raising money and getting shareholders; if we were, I think the <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> status would help us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bush Lauren said FEED Projects never would have gone the nonprofit route exclusively (there is a foundation attached to FEED). She knew from the first purchase order she received from Amazon in 2007 that her idea -- to sell designer products with a tangible, measurable donation built into their prices -- begged for incorporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEED Projects reports donations of $6 million and nearly 60 million school meals through the World Food Program's school feeding program. The products themselves have become trendsetting staples worn by celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. ''Our business model tackles poverty through consumerism,'' said Ms. Bush Lauren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other social entrepreneurs still prefer the traditional nonprofit route. An example is Devin Hibbard, who applied for nonprofit status when she decided to help Ugandan women go into business for themselves eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The core of our identity is much more aligned with a nonprofit than a business,'' she said, even though she acknowledged that her organization, BeadforLife operates ''very much'' like a business. It buys jewelry and shea butter from impoverished women, at the same time helping them start small businesses of their own. It then sells the products in the United States, online and through events that raise awareness about extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hibbard says she believes that her nonprofit status allows for a wider trust among her customer base. ''If we were for-profit, I think we'd spend a lot of time explaining to our consumers why we operate the way we do,'' she said. ''I think our sales would go down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so Ms. Hibbard is sticking with her decision to go nonprofit, while Ms. Bush Lauren runs her business exactly the way she likes it and Mr. Griswold is embracing the <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> movement. But in the end, ''it's all about poverty eradication,'' said Ms. Hibbard. And that's something they could probably all agree on.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States regulators said Friday they were postponing a significant part of the financial regulatory overhaul after banks said they would not be ready for the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulators proposed the rules in June as part of an international effort to harmonize the global financial system. Smaller banks immediately objected to the proposals, saying they would be too costly and might deter them from making loans.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the rules were supposed to take effect at the beginning of next year, but regulators have decided a delay makes sense. The rules stem from internationally agreed standards adopted by a body called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In light of the volume of comments received and the wide range of views expressed during the comment period, the agencies do not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on January 1, 2013," said a statement from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States regulators are in agreement about most parts of the Basel overhaul, according to two people familiar with the process who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not public. The main sticking point appears to be whether to exempt smaller banks from some of the rules. One senior official said the agencies were planning to postpone the rules only briefly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators may have initially been caught off guard by the level of opposition to the Basel rules among smaller banks. Last month, an industry group called the Independent Community Bankers of America said that "nearly 15,000 community bankers and their allies" had signed a petition against the rules. "We are very pleased with the delay," said Christopher Cole, senior regulatory counsel at the I.C.B.A. "We're hoping we get an exemption."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the community banks don't like Basel measures that would make banks hold bigger loss buffers, or capital, against mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, regulators have expressed sympathy for the concerns of smaller banks. In a speech on Friday, a Federal Reserve governor, Elizabeth A. Duke, suggested that smaller banks should have separate rules for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Basel rules demand more capital for mortgages with features that might make them less likely to get repaid. Community bank mortgages to individuals have some of those features. For instance, they often make so-called balloon mortgages, which borrowers have to pay off after, say, seven years, or refinance. Ms. Duke noted, however, that community banks in fact had losses on residential mortgages in the financial crisis that were far below those on subprime loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am convinced that the best course for policymakers would be to abandon efforts for a 'one size fits all' approach to mortgage lending," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But regulators face a real headache in deciding which banks should be subject to which mortgage rules. The Obama administration's long-term aim is to reduce the amount of mortgages that the government guarantees. It wants to go back to a market where private banks and investors hold more mortgages. But banks may want to hold less if they are subject to the Basel rules. There's a danger with making the rules too loose, though. That could prompt smaller banks to make too many risky loans. While smaller banks may not have had huge problems with mortgages to individuals, many such firms collapsed under the weight of losses on loans made to borrowers who bought land and business properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her speech, Ms. Duke appeared to acknowledge the risks. "Crafting regulations to address the real problems that occurred in subprime lending without creating punitive burdens on community banks may prove to be quite difficult," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, the delay announced Friday does not apply to the Basel rules on Wall Street trading operations that regulators finalized in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, most large banks already have enough capital to meet the Basel capital requirements that come into effect on Jan. 1. However, they haven't amassed all the capital that they will need by the end of the Basel phase-in period, which extends till the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some advocates of stronger regulation said they hoped the delay on Friday wouldn't lead to exemptions for large banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are few things more important in financial reform than increasing capital at large banks," said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that has pressed for a tough financial system overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Neubauer, 27, said she was surprised to find the warehouse club selling financial products, she and her husband saved about $200 a month by refinancing through its Web site this year. She also bought home insurance from <span class="companylink">Costco</span>, she said, again because it was cheaper there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the nation's largest banks stay stingy with credit and a growing portion of the population has no bank at all, major retailers are stepping into the void. Customers can now withdraw cash at an A.T.M. with a prepaid card from <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, take out a loan at <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> for a kitchen renovation or kick-start a new venture with a small-business loan from Sam's Club. This year, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> even started to test selling a life insurance policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer advocates are torn about the growth of this shadow banking industry. Financial products are making it into the hands of people who otherwise might not qualify for them, but these products are not always subject to the same regulations as bank products are. And to turn a profit, retailers generally have to charge more to people with poor credit or none at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These products can come with high fees and few real protections,'' said Norma P. Garcia, a senior lawyer with Consumers Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the retailers, banking products are not huge profit centers but a business strategy, meant to put money into customers' hands and get them buying more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've got to remember, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> is intended to be a one-stop shop,'' said Charles M. Holley Jr., the company's chief financial officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers were once interested in actually becoming banks. Sears, in the 1980s, tried a ''socks and stocks'' strategy that included acquiring the Dean Witter brokerage firm. And <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span> sought a banking charter for almost a decade before finally abandoning the quest in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While supermarket chains have leased space to bank branches for years, they are now offering their own products or teaming with small financial firms to do an end run around big banks. While the banks are likely to bristle at such competition, supporters of the retailers say the stores are stepping into areas that banks have abandoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The banks kind of dropped the ball, and in my mind, and in the consumers' mind, they left it open for different approaches,'' said Robert L. Phillips, a professor at Columbia Business School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the lure is the so-called underbanked population -- people who use few, if any, bank services. The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> estimates that roughly 10 million households in the United States do not use a bank, up from nine million three years ago. And the agency says 24 million more households have a bank account but still use nonbank financial services, like prepaid cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holley said that 20 to 25 percent of <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> customers were unbanked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more kinds of services we can offer our core customer like that, the better for them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> unveiled a prepaid card with <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. The card operates much like a debit card except that it is not attached to a bank account. It comes with free customer-service telephone support, and fees are relatively low, but the account is not backed by the F.D.I.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustrated with the fees charged by her bank, Nancy Fry, a real estate broker in Logan, Utah, bought a prepaid card from <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> this year. But this was even worse, she said -- she was charged $3 every time she loaded money onto the card. ''I really don't have very much money and can't afford these fees,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer advocates complain that prepaid cards are loosely regulated and can cannibalize the money put on them. Consumer lawyers have pushed for greater disclosure of fees and more stringent regulation of the card providers. The government is expected to issue new rules this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Walmart</span> began to test selling a one-year <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> life insurance policy this year, and customers can wire money or pay bills at any <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Costco</span> is also courting customers who are fed up with their banks. ''A lot of members think their bank fees are too high, or the trust level has gone down over the years, or they're having issues with debit and credit cards,'' said Jay Smith, <span class="companylink">Costco</span>'s director of business and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Costco</span> sells auto and homeowners' insurance, offers credit card processing for small businesses and began making mortgages in late 2010. It does not make money on the mortgages, which are offered by small lenders, Mr. Smith said. The idea is to get people to renew their store memberships, where <span class="companylink">Costco</span> makes a large chunk of its profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, whose customers are mainly homeowners, is trying to increase sales by extending credit to people who would otherwise have trouble getting it. Last year, the company began offering loans of up to $40,000, and this year it extended its no-interest credit card payment terms. ''We have the ability to get credit to consumers in this tight credit market, and we wanted people to take advantage of that in a market where people don't have access to home-equity lines of credit like they used to,'' said Dwaine Kimmet, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s treasurer and vice president for financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kimmet said the loans were especially useful for people who needed emergency items, like a water heater, though shoppers use them for other home décor projects as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are also helpful for <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, whose sales growth has been squeezed by the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kimmet said the store loans, unlike home-equity lines of credit, did not require collateral, meaning <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> could not seize someone's house for a failure to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest rate on <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s credit card is higher than that on a typical credit card -- 18 percent to 27 percent, depending on credit score, compared with an average of 14.59 percent, according to Bankrate. But Mr. Kimmet said the retailer offered cards to people with credit scores as low as 600, below what many lenders accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other retailers are also trying to make it easier for people to qualify for financial products. <span class="companylink">Office Depot</span> and Sam's Club offer loans backed by the government's <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>, and both involve quick, one-page initial applications. More than 1,000 Sam's Club members have used the program since its introduction two years ago, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kent Prater was about to open a restaurant in Lumberton, N.C., he searched online for loans backed by the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> and found that Sam's Club sold them. He applied online for a $25,000 loan and was approved for a $10,000 loan, with an interest rate of about 10 percent. With a bank, ''I think it would probably be a little bit more difficult, because of the environment -- the economy and the regulatory environment,'' said Mr. Prater, who opened Thai Chili last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paco Underhill, who researches shopper behavior as founder and chief executive of Envirosell, said retailers offering financial products was only the beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The banks are going to scream bloody murder when retailers try to obtain banking charters,'' he said. ''But it's not hard for a retail organization to look across the landscape and say, 'Who are my customers, and what else could I be selling them?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. O'Garro bakes nondairy cheesecakes that she was selling at a handful of grocery stores, including two Whole Foods outlets, in the Boston area. She hoped to learn how to expand the business and distribute the cakes nationally. ''I know Jim is all over the place,'' she said, ''and I want to be like that.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim is Jim Koch, the founder of the <span class="companylink">Boston Beer Company</span> and one of 36 advisers who spent an evening last August ''speed coaching'' fledgling food, beverage and hospitality businesses. In 20-minute sessions, some 95 bakers, brewers and restaurant owners peppered the coaches -- <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> employees and consultants who included lawyers, accountants and small-business counselors -- with questions about both basic day-to-day issues and more strategic concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speed coaching is one element of ''Brewing the American Dream,'' a program <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> established with a microlender, Accion, to help small businesses. Mr. Koch, who started brewing Samuel Adams Boston Lager at his house in 1984, remains central to these efforts even as he presides over a company with a market capitalization of $1.4 billion and annual revenue of more than $500 million. He said he had not forgotten his early days, when he struggled to find capital, get his beer into distribution networks and expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In six sessions that August evening, Mr. Koch spoke with perhaps a dozen entrepreneurs and then stayed another hour to visit with six or eight more. This year, <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> and Accion are staging 12 speed-coaching events in 11 cities, and Mr. Koch expects to attend about half of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big businesses reaching out to help smaller businesses has come into vogue since the recession. In 2009, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> introduced its 10,000 Small Businesses campaign. <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> raises money from customer donations to finance small-business loans. <span class="companylink">American Express</span> encourages consumers to shop locally on ''Small Business Saturday'' after Thanksgiving. The New York Stock Exchange links small vendors with large corporations and finances loans through Accion. And several corporations have run contests -- <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, Chase Bank and Staples have furnished winning small companies with opportunities for retail distribution, capital and office equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest example of what is known in corporate circles as cause marketing -- hitching a brand to a social issue. ''How you improve the American economy and create jobs is on everybody's minds these days,'' said David Hessekiel, founder and president of Cause Marketing Forum. ''Companies know that it's on the minds of their consumers, and they want to be seen as part of the solution, not as the enemy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been a particular concern for chains like <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, given their longstanding reputations for forcing local competitors to close. Helping small businesses, Mr. Hessekiel said, ''helps them deal with an old issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some critics of the big chains dismiss their chivalry as mostly cosmetic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The public relations value of being associated with small business is quite high,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit based in Minneapolis and Washington that promotes strong local economies. ''You've got companies that have very aggressive expansion strategies -- they're really squeezing out opportunities for small businesses. These programs do very little compared to the larger shifts in market share that these companies are driving. They're drops in the bucket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its part, the <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> program actually predates the recent economic crisis. The seeds of the idea, Mr. Koch said, came to him in 2007 as he walked to his car after he and his employees had volunteered to paint a nearby community center. ''I should have felt really good, and I didn't -- I felt a little depressed,'' he said. ''What I realized is, I'd just taken about $10,000 worth of management time and talent, and turned it into about $1,000 worth of painting. And it was pretty bad painting, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koch retooled his company's philanthropy to take advantage of its resources, particularly its employees' expertise. The company has committed $1.4 million to finance loans, which are handled by Accion. The loans are small, typically $5,000 to $7,000, with terms of 18 months to two years and interest rates that vary regionally. (In New England, the rate is around 13 percent, typical for microloans.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps as important as the money is the tutoring by Mr. Koch and his employees. Most microloan programs provide borrowers with rudimentary counseling, but <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> is unusually ''high touch,'' said Shaolee Sen, vice president for strategy and development at the Accion U.S. Network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. O'Garro was one of the program's original clients -- she has had two loans, totaling $4,000 -- and though she's repaid that debt and though the muffin business it helped finance has been dormant since 2010, she continues to derive benefits from the program with her cheesecake business, Delectable Desires. She learned how to price her cakes from an employee in <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span>'s finance department, Mike Cramer, who went to Whole Foods and scoped out the competition. ''He actually made a spreadsheet for me of how much the high-end and low-end desserts cost,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another borrower, Sandy Russo of Lulu's Sweet Shoppe in Boston, said that when she had questions, she sometimes called Mr. Koch's executive assistant. Last summer, when Lulu's opened a second location, <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span>'s lawyers reviewed the lease and its public relations staff wrote the news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it's one thing to provide that kind of support to a handful of companies. The question facing Accion and <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> is whether the program can remain as intensive as it expands nationally. ''We're really struggling with that right now,'' Ms. Sen said. ''The portfolio has been so small up until this point that they really are passionate about their clients.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the loans grow and become more far-flung, <span class="companylink">Boston Beer</span> and Accion will try to package that passion as Web content, Ms. Sen said, and steer some borrowers to webinars, live chats and ''recycled content,'' like recorded conversations with other borrowers. Next year, the partners will introduce an online community for borrowers with discussion boards and a new <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>-type service tentatively called Jim's List.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Ms. O'Garro sat down with Mr. Koch at a table in one of the brewery's tasting rooms, she was filled with uncertainty. Earlier in the evening, a consultant, Carol Coutrier, had suggested that she consider marketing the cheesecakes to food service distributors that serve institutional kitchens at hospitals and schools. ''The supermarkets will kill you, absolutely kill you,'' with their various promotional requirements, she said. ''They'll bleed you dry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Ms. O'Garro mentioned her other product, an all-natural graham crumb for pie crusts, made with honey instead of high-fructose corn syrup. This, Ms. Coutrier said, was a more distinctive product and one that might go further than a nondairy cheesecake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koch, with a lager glass of his company's Whitewater IPA in front of him and a genial grin on his face, told Ms. O'Garro it was O.K. to have two products. ''The market,'' he said, ''will tell you which one they want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Koch suggested that the graham crumbs' high production cost would keep sales down and make it harder for her to produce enough to justify hiring her first employees. At the moment, Ms. O'Garro does everything, from the baking to the selling, all while holding a 30-hour-a-week night job at <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span>. If necessary, he said, she should cut her margins to increase volume. ''You've got to get to the point where you can leverage yourself,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the coaching, Ms. O'Garro settled on an all-of-the-above strategy. She cut the price on the graham crumbs in the hopes of selling more. She has also pushed to place her cakes in eight more Whole Foods. And she called one of the distributors Ms. Coutrier recommended, quickly winning an audition -- and an order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, she baked 480 cheesecakes for cafeterias in the area. Her new distributor is negotiating to introduce Delectable Desires cakes to an upscale restaurant chain, and a handful of universities may follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early 2013, she hopes to ring up monthly sales of at least $5,000 -- enough to hire her first part-time employee.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congratulations! Your start-up is now valued at over $1 billion!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might seem exciting, as though you've won a lottery. But in reality, when you recheck your lottery ticket, you might find you were off by a single number.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see, being in the Billion-Dollar Start-Up Club limits how, and if, a company can get out of the Billion-Dollar Start-Up Club - at least safely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Club is growing quickly. Based on recent financing rounds and stories about the companies, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is valued at $8.5 billion; <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span> at $5 billion; <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span>, $4 billion; Square, $3.25 billion; Spotify, $3 billion; Rovio, $3 billion; <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, $2.5 billion; <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>, $1.5 billion; Box, $1.2 billion; Gilt Groupe, $1.1 billion; and Evernote, $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens more companies are within arms' reach, including <span class="companylink">Foursquare</span>, WordPress, GitHub, <span class="companylink">Quora</span> and Fab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have a lot to worry about. First, when you're the most expensive product on the shelf, very few companies can afford to buy you. Apple, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and maybe <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> are on a short list of corporations that could finance an acquisition of this size without reaching for lint in their pockets afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that Apple rarely makes acquisitions, that leaves <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and possibly <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And speaking of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>: after its lackluster initial public offering, when its stock dropped by half, going public isn't very appealing. Groupon, valued at $12.65 billion before its public offering at $20 a share, is now trading at a mere $2.98. <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, another member of the Club, is now $2.21 a share, down from a high of $15.91 this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a start-up valuation increases, the options definitely decrease," said Jon Callaghan, a partner with <span class="companylink">True Ventures</span> who has been investing since the early 1990s. When you're valued at more than $1 billion, he said, "you have to have a flawless execution, as it's upping the ante quite a bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these companies' valuations might be justified by revenue and growth. <span class="companylink">DropBox</span>, for instance, has an estimated $500 million in revenue and 100 million users. Others, like <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> and Fab, are as overhyped as Pets.com was in Tech Bubble 1.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If these companies are deemed overvalued, they may have no option but to perform so-called down round investments, where a round of private financing prices a company at a lower valuation than a previous investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That almost happened to Spotify, the music streaming service. In May, the company was ready to close a round of financing that would have valued it at $4 billion. Then <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> nose-dived, and Netflix, which is the closest example of a subscription-based online service like Spotify, also stumbled. Spotify finally closed a round this month that valued it at $3 billion - $1 billion off its projected valuation just six months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You certainly have more options at the $10 million valuation and a lot more paths you can go down," acknowledged Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, a corporate cloud storage start-up. "But there's a virtue to having less options in that it gives us the ability to focus, and our visibility of what we need to do is much clearer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-ups with higher valuations can also run into trouble when trying to woo new talent. If an engineer joins a company valued at $10 million that grows to $1 billion, there is an opportunity to get very rich. That is not the case when joining a company already valued at 10 figures that might slip to six or seven figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s paltry stock performance affecting other I.P.O.'s, Mr. Levie said this could actually help start-ups by allowing them to stave off investors and focus on their business models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ultimately, it shouldn't be anyone's goal to go public; this is just a financing event to create liquidity for investors and shareholders," he said. "I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that there are eight to 10 companies that make $1 billion acquisitions in the enterprise space. It's mostly the consumer space where this becomes less probable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, "There you really only have one suitor: <span class="companylink">Google</span>."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes joining the Billion-Dollar Start-Up Club isn't really as much fun as it might seem.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most measures, the personal finances of Anne Zimmerman, a small-business owner in Cincinnati, have little in common with those of <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>'s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zimmerman runs an accounting business and a cloud-based Internet service company with combined annual profit of $250,000 to $500,000 in recent years. Mr. Ellison made nearly $15 million in salary, bonuses and perks in 2011, even without the $62 million he received in stock options from <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the deficit reduction debate now consuming Washington, however, both Mr. Ellison and Ms. Zimmerman are grouped in the same, sprawling category: wealthy Americans targeted for tax increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has focused efforts on raising revenue from the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers -- individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and families with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 -- calling them ''millionaires and billionaires who can afford to pay a little more.'' Republicans have thus far resisted those efforts, countering that the high earners are job creators and that increasing their taxes would discourage hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for all the broad brush rhetoric of political debate, the rate increases and limits on deductions now being discussed by the president and Congressional Republicans are calibrated to take the biggest bite out of the highest earners. They would lead to a smaller increase for those who earn less than $500,000 a year. The figures are all adjusted gross incomes, and since some deductions would be preserved, a household would probably have more than $250,000 in total income, perhaps $300,000, before it would fall into the wealthy definition used by the president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all Mr. Obama's tax proposals for wealthy Americans were enacted, they would raise $1.6 trillion over the next decade. And an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>, a nonpartisan research firm, found that the increases would be heavily weighted toward the wealthiest. Taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $1 million would see average increases of $184,504, the study found, with higher taxes on the ultrawealthy bloating that average. Those with adjusted gross incomes from $200,000 to $500,000 would face a tax increase averaging $4,446, with people toward the lower end having only a modest increase and people on the higher end paying several times more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A married couple with two children earning $300,000 would see its effective tax rate increase to 21.1 percent from 16.5 percent, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>. A married couple with two children earning $2 million would see its effective federal income tax rate rise to 26.8 percent from 21.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Ms. Zimmerman, the Cincinnati businesswoman, that amount sounds reasonable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not going to change my business decision-making process based on a few percentage points of tax increases,'' she said. ''If it helps get the country on a better path, well, we're all in this together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some conservatives and business advocates warn that the proposed increases could stall the sluggish economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a price that comes with these tax increases on the very wealthiest because that is where the capital is concentrated,'' said William McBride, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span>, a conservative research firm. ''That price is economic growth and hiring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About four million of the 114 million American households face a possible tax increase. And while they are a narrow slice of the overall population, they are nonetheless a swath of well-to-do Americans so varied that they defy easy categorization. Census data indicates that they cut across a broad range of occupations: doctors, auto dealers and dilettantes, professional athletes and financial planners, family farmers, entrepreneurs, two-income couples, corporate executives and hedge fund managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they are dispersed across the country, they live in the highest concentrations in South Florida, the suburbs of the Northeast and the West, and in major cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the profits of many companies are taxed as the owners' individual income, the group facing increases also includes 3 percent of all small businesses, like Ms. Zimmerman's. But the United States tax code is such a blunt instrument that small business may encompass anything from the neighborhood florist shop to the multibillion-dollar private equity company <span class="companylink">KKR</span> and the <span class="companylink">Tribune Company</span>. Data from the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> indicate that 237 of the country's 400 highest earners also qualify as small businesses, as does President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades ago, the tax code made distinctions between gradations of wealth by using more income brackets. In 1970, there were 14 tax brackets for the top 2 percent of earners, with a top rate of 91 percent. Today there are just two brackets, 33 percent and 35 percent. Meeting with Republican Congressional leaders on Friday, President Obama said he would not sign any bill to extend those top rates, which were lowered by President George W. Bush. That means the top rates would revert to the higher levels of the Clinton era, 36 percent and 39.6 percent (the higher rate would be charged on the portion of income that exceeds the threshold of $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families). Republicans have said they will oppose any deal that raises the rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both sides have agreed in principle on raising revenue by reducing or eliminating loopholes, tax subsidies and deductions at the high end of the income scale. Even if the top rates do not rise, the efforts to limit deductions would make the tax system more progressive, with the biggest impact felt by those at the very top in incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations over the coming weeks will determine whether a compromise can be reached between the president and the Republicans. If not, automatic spending cuts and tax increases will take effect on Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most closely watched variables will be whether President Obama wins support for increasing the tax rate on dividends and long-term capital gains, which now top out at 15 percent. Mr. Obama's budget calls for the tax on capital gains to rise to a maximum of 20 percent and for dividends to be taxed at the same level as ordinary income, which could increase to 39.6 percent. Because investment income for those with adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 will also be subject to a 3.8 percent Medicare tax beginning in January, as part of the new health care law, the total federal tax on dividends could rise to 43.4 percent and on capital gains to 23.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those capital gains and dividend tax increases are likely to have the most impact at the very highest reaches of the income scale because wealthy Americans derive more of their earnings from investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span> found that in 2011, people in the top 0.1 percent of earners saved an average of $356,000 in federal income taxes because of the preferential rate for capital gains. Middle-income Americans were spared an average of just $23 because of the lower taxes on capital gains, the study found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capital gains are extremely concentrated by income,'' said Len Burman, a former Treasury official who has written extensively about taxes on investment income. ''There's no source of income more focused on the very, very wealthiest. A lot of people own stocks indirectly through their 401(k)'s. But most Americans can't afford to own any shares directly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another policy change that has some support from both parties is a plan to limit the total amount of deductions. Mr. Obama's proposal would treat deductions for the wealthy as if they were in the 28 percent tax bracket, reducing their value. But the negotiations have also considered a plan championed by Mitt Romney during his unsuccessful bid to unseat Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would cap the amount of deductions any taxpayer could claim -- amounts including $17,000 and $28,000 have been discussed publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, limits on deductions would appear to duplicate the goal of the alternative minimum tax, which was enacted in the 1970s to ensure that the wealthiest Americans would not completely escape paying federal income taxes. But tax planning has become so sophisticated in the decades since then that even some Republicans acknowledge that a new cap could help raise revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all of Mr. Obama's proposals are enacted, those with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 to $500,000 would see their after-tax income drop an average of 1.3 percent. Taxpayers with incomes over $1 million would face a decline in after-tax income of 8.8 percent, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say restoring high-end tax rates to levels similar to those in the Clinton administration will help trim the deficit with minimal effect on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Bush tax cuts were unaffordable and skewed overwhelmingly to the wealthiest,'' said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the <span class="companylink">Center for Budget and Policy Priorities</span>, a liberal research group. ''So it only makes sense that these tax increases would be concentrated on the highest end, too.''</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee, a lawyer turned entrepreneur, has a simple formula: partner with a celebrity that fans associate with a certain product, whether stilettos or baby supplies. He first did it in 1999, when he cold-called Robert Shapiro, O.J. Simpson's lawyer, and persuaded him to join him at his first start-up, <span class="companylink">LegalZoom</span>, for creating your own legal documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring a famous face to represent your brand is the oldest marketing trick in the book. But Mr. Lee is doing it with an Internet twist. He uses celebrities' social media connections with fans, coupled with recent innovations in e-commerce, to sell things in ways that were not possible just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Honest Company, Ms. Alba's start-up selling eco-friendly baby supplies, has raised $27 million from investors, including <span class="companylink">Lightspeed Venture Partners</span>. <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span>, Ms. Kardashian's shoe company, has raised $66 million from Andreessen Horowitz, <span class="companylink">Lightspeed</span> and others. But despite this investment, it has recently struggled, replacing its chief executive, laying off employees and raising bigger questions about the new breed of subscription e-commerce companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-commerce is going through a shift, as retailers move beyond publishing print catalogs online to creating new business models for the Web. According to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>, venture capitalists invested $2.2 billion in e-commerce start-ups last year, almost three times as much as the year before and more than they have invested since the first Internet boom, which created <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> and <span class="companylink">eBay</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee's companies tap the latest e-commerce trends, including selling monthly subscriptions, using software algorithms to determine personal style suggestions and eliminating middlemen by designing products in-house and selling them directly to consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the choice between shopping at a boutique or warehouse, if the styles were right, which would my wife choose?'' Mr. Lee said, describing the strategy behind <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> and Honest. ''A large group of women would choose that kind of curated boutique.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Honest, customers sign up for monthly deliveries of diapers festooned with anchors or hearts as well as items like shampoo and detergent, each formulated in-house to reduce chemicals. Ms. Alba conceived the idea, along with Christopher Gavigan, former chief of the nonprofit Healthy Child Healthy World, and turned to Mr. Lee for a business model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> was founded in 2009, it was the first of a flurry of subscription e-commerce start-ups. The shoes, generally $39.95, are suggested based on the results of a style quiz the customer takes. They are designed by <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> and manufactured at the same factories that big shoe brands use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> has been struggling with that model, and analysts say that could foreshadow problems for its many imitators, which, in addition to Honest, include <span class="companylink">Birchbox</span> for cosmetics, Wittlebee for children's clothing, JustFab for shoes and handbags, and <span class="companylink">BeachMint</span>, which has sites for jewelry, T-shirts, skin care, shoes, home décor and lingerie. Earlier this month, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> joined the trend, introducing a monthly subscription box of food called The Goodies Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Subscriptions were the hot trend in the last year, but I think some of that energy has really flattened,'' said Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce analyst at Forrester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While subscriptions have worked well at companies like <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> and Diapers.com for necessities like toilet paper and diapers, shoppers might find it harder to justify a recurring credit-card charge for colorful suede booties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> switched to a nonsubscription model this year, so shoppers log on whenever they are in the mood to shop instead of receiving monthly boxes. In September, the company replaced its chief executive, Bill Strauss, with Mr. Lee. He laid off 20 of its 220 employees and cut expenses like corporate apartments. Both Honest and <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> are capital-intensive because they design, store and ship their own inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We lost our way,'' said Jeremy Liew, managing director of <span class="companylink">Lightspeed Venture Partners</span>. ''But there's real value in this company and customers love the product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee said <span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span> would approach $100 million in revenue this year and become profitable next year. Honest is not yet a year old, but its founders say it has proved popular with shoppers. Mr. Lee is the right person for the job, Mr. Liew said, because he has a Hollywood sensibility that Bay Area executives lack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's a middle-aged, slightly out-of-shape Korean guy who got Jessica Alba and Kim Kardashian to start companies with him,'' Mr. Liew said. ''That is like sheer force of will and personality. This guy has become the person that Hollywood goes to when they want to talk about starting companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Silicon Valley veterans write off celebrities flocking to tech as a sign of a bubble. But Mr. Lee has a keen understanding of how to take advantage of their fame in social media, Mr. Liew said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His celebrity co-founders are not just pretty faces. Instead, they use <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and other sites to make direct sales, and it works because their fans think they have some authority in the items they are selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a picture of Tiger Woods wearing a Rolex in a magazine,'' Mr. Liew said. ''This is Kim saying, 'These are great shoes, you'll love them, you can get them for $39 a month, try it now.' It's directly driving a response, not just an abstract brand halo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Alba said her work on Honest was nearly a full-time job (in addition to gun training for ''Sin City 2''). ''Being the face of something and not having control and input on the manufacturing process is not something I'm interested in,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most successful Bay Area companies have also relied on celebrity, if not as obviously, Mr. Lee said. <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s popularity soared after Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher competed to get the most followers, and Lady Gaga's 53.6 million <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> likes bring people to that site. It is a rare Silicon Valley party that does not include Mr. Kutcher or M C Hammer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee has become an expert at bridging the worlds of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Ms. Alba said she tried for three years to find backing for her company before he agreed to join her and accompanied her to pitch venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was just turned down by so many people because it wasn't sexy,'' she said. ''I think when you walk in with Brian Lee, you're pretty much golden.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- President Obama surrounded himself with taxpayers on Wednesday to pitch his plan to preserve current rates for the middle class and raise them for the wealthy. A day before, he met with small-business owners for the same purpose. On Friday, he plans to fly to Pennsylvania to tour a factory to make the same point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the president and Congress hurtle toward a reckoning on the highest federal budget deficit in generations, Mr. Obama says he wants a ''balanced'' approach to restoring the nation's fiscal order. But the high-profile public campaign he has been waging in recent days has focused almost entirely on the tax side of the equation, with scant talk about his priorities when it comes to curbing spending.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has embraced specific cuts to the federal budget in the past and has committed to an agreement with Congress that will include deep reductions in spending. But it would be easy for those who listen to his public pronouncements lately to miss it. In public statements since his re-election, he has barely discussed how he would pare back federal spending, focusing instead on the aspect of his plan that plays to his liberal base and involves all gain and no pain for 98 percent of taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans and even some Democrats have expressed frustration that Mr. Obama has avoided a serious public discussion on spending with barely a month until deep automatic budget cuts and tax increases are scheduled to take effect. While the president's aides said it was important to engage the public on taxes, others say he has not prepared the country for the sacrifice that would come with lower spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem is real,'' said Erskine B. Bowles, who was co-chairman of Mr. Obama's deficit reduction commission. ''The solutions are painful, and there's not going to be an easy way out of this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After meeting with White House officials this week, Mr. Bowles said he believed ''they were serious about reducing spending'' but added that ''we need to talk more about the spending side of the equation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican leaders were more scathing, saying the president was more interested in campaigning than sitting down to resolve difficult issues. They said they were willing to raise tax revenue by closing loopholes and limiting deductions, but Mr. Obama has not reciprocated with more restraint of entitlement programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have not seen any good-faith effort on the part of this administration to talk about the real problem that we're trying to fix,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. ''This has to be a part of this agreement or else we just continue to dig the hole deeper, asking folks to allow us to kick the can down the road further. And that we don't want to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Obama has not scheduled a new meeting with Congressional leaders, he will dispatch top advisers to Capitol Hill for talks on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Rob Nabors, the White House legislative director, will pay separate visits to Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Democratic and Republican leaders, and Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio and Nancy Pelosi of California, the Republican speaker and Democratic minority leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama met privately on Wednesday with the chief executives of 14 major corporations like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, Marriott, <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>, <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> to discuss the fiscal situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He seemed flexible, but he said taxes should go up on the top 2 percent,'' said one executive who did not want to be named. Most of the executives said they were not opposed to tax increases as part of a deal but stressed that a quick resolution could help the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials rejected Republican suggestions that Mr. Obama has not been serious enough about tackling the growth of entitlement spending. ''He is committed, every time he talks about this, to a balanced approach that includes both, you know, revenues, spending cuts and savings through entitlement reforms,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials pointed to $340 billion in health care entitlement program savings and $272 billion in reductions to other mandatory programs over 10 years in a previous presidential budget proposal. ''Even though that budget proposal's been out there for a long time, a lot of people aren't aware of that,'' Mr. Carney said. '' He called it ''another piece of evidence that the president has been willing to make tough choices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason a lot of people may not be aware of the cuts Mr. Obama has proposed is that he does not talk about them often. In his first postelection news conference, he focused on tax increases on the wealthy and used the term ''spending cuts'' just once without elaborating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By focusing on taxes, Mr. Obama has put Republicans on the defensive. At Wednesday's event, he challenged them to extend Bush-era tax cuts for family income under $250,000 since both sides agree those should continue. Doing so would effectively mean tax cuts on income over $250,000 would expire at the end of the year since Mr. Obama would not sign a separate bill extending them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's public lobbying seemed to crack through the solid Republican opposition this week when a prominent conservative, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, urged his party to seek such a quick deal with Mr. Obama extending middle-class tax cuts. Mr. Boehner pushed back against Mr. Cole on Wednesday, saying that would hurt small businesses and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Obama evidently sees no percentage in talking in detail about spending cuts, acutely aware that his liberal base is unenthusiastic about paring back entitlement programs. Senator Richard J. Durbin, a longtime Illinois ally and the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said this week that Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security should not be part of current budget talks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the two sides continued to shadowbox, Mr. Bowles was skeptical, putting the chances of a deal by the end of the year at one in three. ''I believe the probability is that we are going over the cliff,'' he said, ''and I think that will be horrible.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Wycliffe knew "The King's Speech" had gotten rave reviews. So when he arrived at the theater about two years ago, he was surprised by what he saw. "It was a great movie, but the place was just empty," he said. "It had 230 or 240 seats, but there was me and a couple and that was it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wycliffe had just completed his bachelor's degree in economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Midway through, he'd taken time off to start a small marketing firm with his brother. Now he hankered to build something new.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He found himself thinking about Hotwire and Priceline, the discount sites he'd used for several years to book hotel rooms that would otherwise go unoccupied. "What if we could partner with theaters and help them fill their seats in the same way?" he wondered. Moviegoers would pay for discounted tickets, specifying the film, the approximate time of day and the neighborhood. After completing a purchase, they would learn the exact showtime and theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wycliffe incorporated Dealflicks last year. He started working full-time on the project in January along with two co-founders and they introduced a beta site in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-Founders: Mr. Wycliffe, 29, is the chief executive officer. Kevin Hong, 27, is the vice president of sales, and Zachary Cancio, 25, the chief technology officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees: Dealflicks has one full-time employee, a business development manager who started out as the company's summer intern. Two more - a designer and a software engineer - are expected to come onboard soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location: Dealflicks moved in October from Mr. Wycliffe's Oakland apartment to Mountain View, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pitch: "Dealflicks is like <span class="companylink">Priceline.com</span> or Hotwire.com, but for movie theaters," Mr. Wycliffe said. "Right now about 88 percent of seats are empty on average. We partner with movie theaters and help them do marketing to fill these empty seats. Our deals are usually tickets - or tickets and popcorn, tickets and soda, that kind of thing - at up to 60 percent off." From that discounted price, Dealflicks typically takes a 10-percent cut, though agreements vary by individual partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traction:Dealflicks has contracted with 62 movie theaters so far. First to sign on was the Gardena Cinema in Los Angeles County. Mr. Hong wooed its Korean owners by bringing them his mother's homemade pajun scallion pancakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trying to build a primary base of theaters in the Bay Area, Dealflicks has also inked deals with partners in Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This fall, Dealflicks won a slot in the accelerator run by 500 Startups, a seed fund and program for early-stage ventures created by Dave McClure, a former <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> executive. The relationship developed after Mr. Wycliffe and his co-founders attended Unsexy, a conference for companies that are promising but unlikely to set pulses racing in Silicon Valley. At the conference, they talked to every 500 Startups alumni they could find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Then when walking out of an auditorium, we literally stumbled upon some dude coding on the floor. That dude turned out to be the C.T.O. of <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span>, Aaron Batalion," Mr. Cancio wrote on his blog. "But neither Sean nor I realized who he was at the time. Like a scout, I surreptitiously looked at his name badge. I muttered a quiet suggestion to Sean and before I knew it, Sean marched up to Aaron and introduced himself." That chance meeting wasn't all it took to get into the accelerator -- but it helped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue: So far, Dealflicks has sold a couple of hundred tickets, according to Mr. Wycliffe, who said total revenue has not yet passed the single-digit thousands. "But the growth is there," he said. "This month, we've sold more than in the previous three months combined." The company issued its first paychecks on Nov. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing: Dealflicks has raised $115,000. Friends and family put in about $65,000. The remaining $50,000 came from 500 Startups. The company is seeking $250,000 in angel investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketing: The company holds parties at college campuses to get the word out. ("Dealflicks just hooked us up with a keg!!!" one Berkley student announced on the company's <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page.) It also focused on search engine optimization, working to rank high in <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches when users hunt for ticket deals. They've partnered with several larger sites that take a commission for driving sales their way. And they've also scored appearances on a couple of Bay Area television news affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition: Movietickets.com and Fandango are the Goliaths of the online ticketing space. "They're great but they're different than what we do because they only sell full-price tickets, and they charge a convenience fee as well," Mr. Wycliffe said. Entrants in the discount space are more of a wild card; five or six of them have come and gone in the last couple of years, he said. One contender, MoviePass, offers unlimited theater trips for a monthly fee. (In a sector that loves analogies, it aims to be the "Netflix of movie theaters.")</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH the prospect of significant changes in tax rates and deduction limits, taxpayers have been coming up with all sorts of strategies to save on their taxes, some riskier than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I couldn't help but be skeptical when I was told about a plan aimed at small-business owners in their 50s who have saved little for retirement but can now afford to put aside a lot of money each year. They can then deduct that money as a business expense, resulting in a significant tax savings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I checked with the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>, and the plan is indeed legitimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a defined-benefit plan, much like the one large employers once regularly offered their workers, that guarantees a set monthly payment in retirement. In this case, though, the plan works best for really small businesses -- those that employ just one or two people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. allows a maximum annual contribution to the plan of about $255,000 for people in their 50s. (For younger workers, the contribution limit is lower, because the calculation is based on the number of years until retirement. In some cases, the limit is so low that other retirement savings options might be better.) Total holdings in the plan are limited to $2.3 million to $2.4 million, enough to cover the maximum allowed payment in retirement of $200,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advisers said the plans were less effective in companies with more employees, particularly older ones, because the owner would be required to make contributions for all of them, and at a high level, since older employees are typically better paid and closer to retirement. (If the additional employees were young and low-paid, the cost of offering the plan to them might be low enough for it to make sense.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not too good to be true,'' said Lisa C. Germano, president and general counsel at Actuarial Benefits and Design Company in Midlothian, Va. ''But you need to be able to fund the plan and fund it for an indefinite period. It's a commitment. That's one of the reasons you get the reward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some advisers like Ms. Germano were worried that, like other generous deductions, this one could be threatened in the current tax and budget negotiations. But regardless of how the talks in Washington turn out, this is still the time of year when many small-business owners need to decide whether to set up a defined-benefit plan or stick with more traditional forms of retirement savings, like SEP I.R.A.'s for the self-employed or a profit-sharing plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is some of what I learned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UPSIDE Defined-benefit plans are mainly a way for small-business owners who neglected to save for retirement to catch up. The ideal candidates can put away $100,000 to $150,000 a year for at least 10 years, said Leigh Goldblatt, vice president and chief compliance officer at Glazer Financial Network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the case with John Rogers, a Denver businessman. ''I was in my late 50s and I didn't have a penny saved for retirement,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lost his life savings in his 40s, he said, in a recycling company he started with friends. He also raised six children, four of whom he said he put through college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 2006, he was six years into being an independent contractor for Univera, a company that makes nutritional supplements. (The company's sales model is similar to Amway's, where people like Mr. Rogers sell to individuals or find other people to sell for them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his business providing steady, predictable income -- he and his wife are ranked as top sellers for the company -- he wanted to start saving. He said a defined-benefit plan was attractive for both deferring taxes and for saving for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our adviser tells us at the beginning of the year what we have to contribute,'' said Mr. Rogers, 63. ''We're very disciplined. We pay our defined-benefit plan first and then our business expenses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though the I.R.S. assumes the plan will make monthly payments in retirement, which is why it allows people to save so much over a short period of time, owners shut down most of these plans and roll the money in them to a regular retirement account, said Mr. Goldblatt, whose firm advised Mr. Rogers. This reduces expenses and gives the owner control over how to withdraw the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOWNSIDES Such a chance for a retirement savings do-over, as it were, does not come without catches. And skeptics say these plans lure people with the prospect of quick and large retirement savings without discussing the risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The primary problem with defined-benefit plans is you have to fund at least to a minimum level each year,'' said Jerry Love, a certified public accountant in Abilene, Tex. ''You also have to have an actuary do your actuarial analysis each year. And you have to fund the minimum amount, or your plan's in violation and you have all kinds of problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the retirement benefit is set, it is the responsibility of the person who created the plan to make sure it is financed to that level. This means regular annual contributions. It also means the owner must be prepared to put in extra money if the plan dips enough in value to be considered in default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The No. 1 thing that happens to people is their company or industry takes a dip and they don't have the cash flow to fund the plan,'' Mr. Love said. ''There is no option. You have to fund this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a company with only one or two employees, that problem is somewhat easier to manage. The plan could be reworked to lower the ultimate benefit if the owner cannot make the minimum payment or an additional payment, said Greg Stevens, senior financial counselor at <span class="companylink">Cabot Money Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reworking a plan comes at a cost, which is another criticism of defined-benefit plans. Even if everything runs smoothly, the owner still has to pay someone $6,000 to $7,000 a year to do the actuarial calculations and handle the necessary filings, Mr. Stevens said. That is on top of fees to manage the investments in the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As soon as you get to the point where you're not making contributions, you should dissolve it,'' he said. But he cautioned people against thinking they could put a lot of money in one year and then dissolve the plan. To be compliant with the I.R.S., he said, the plan needs to be in place for at least five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharyn E. Cerniglia, who owns American Recycling Systems, which sells heavy equipment to the military, said her contract with the Defense Department had expired after 15 years. If it is not renewed, she said, she might retire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However bittersweet that might be, she and her husband, who helps run the company, have been able to save a lot of money through a defined-benefit plan they set up in 2006. ''We have a couple of million put away that we wouldn't have put away otherwise,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERFECT CANDIDATES Despite the caveats, most advisers saw a value in defined-benefit plans for certain people. Dr. Timothy Georgelas, a radiologist in Dallas, credited his plan with giving him financial security after 32 years as a doctor in the Army and Air Force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Georgelas, 61, said that when he retired from the military in 2001, he went into private practice and within three years was making nearly triple what he had made in the Air Force. With that and his military pension, he said, he was earning more than he and his wife needed to live on, so he wanted to find a way to save some of it for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was really appealing to set aside a good chunk of money every year,'' he said. ''It was mind-boggling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Georgelas said that since 2004 he had put about $100,000 into his defined-benefit plan each year. He now has just under $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet he admitted that he had not had much luck persuading other doctors to open their own plans. ''I think they're scared to take the plunge,'' he said. ''I mention it to others and they say, 'You're kidding.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition among states and cities to lure businesses in hopes of creating jobs is not new, but it has become more fierce in recent years. An investigation by The Times found that state and local governments are giving out $80 billion a year in tax breaks and other subsidies in a foolhardy, shortsighted race to attract companies. That money could go a long way to improving education, transportation and other public services that would have a far better shot at promoting real economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, with these giveaways, politicians and officials are trying to pick winners and losers, almost exclusively to the benefit of big corporations (aided by highly paid lobbyists) at the expense of small businesses. Though they promise that the subsidies are smart investments, far too often the jobs either don't materialize or are short-lived, leaving the communities no better off.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-part series by Louise Story described how in places like Texas and Ohio, state and local governments have lavished millions of dollars in tax breaks on corporate giants like Samsung and the Big Three automakers -- even as they faced budget deficits and were forced to cut spending on critical services. The tax revenues forgone in this giveaway frenzy should concern Congress deeply. After all, federal funds account for one-fifth of state and local budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one particularly egregious example in Pontiac, Mich., the State of Michigan gave $14 million in tax credits and a state pension fund guaranteed $18 million in bonds to a movie studio that created just 12 permanent jobs. In Texas, <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>, the online retailer, received tax abatements, sales tax exemptions and other benefits totaling $277 million to open a warehouse that promises to employ 2,500 people. Those benefits were granted after the retailer closed another warehouse because of a dispute with the government involving sales taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many governments don't know the full value of the subsidies they hand out in the form of tax refunds, rebates, loans, grants and more. And they don't know if the jobs created would have been created anyway. The fact is, numerous studies show that such incentives result in only a small increase in jobs and that any gains usually come at the expense of other cities and states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local governments would be much better off investing tax dollars in education and public works that would deliver long-term benefits to both businesses and workers. California, for instance, is among the least generous of the larger states in doling out tax breaks. It gave out just $112 per capita compared with $759 in Texas, $672 in Michigan, and $210 in New York. Its experience leaves no doubt that investments made in public institutions like the University of California system can remain critically important to economic growth decades later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The senseless race to give away billions in subsidies is, of course, hard to stop when elected leaders think a pledge of potential jobs might help in their next election. But even when attracting businesses is a legitimate goal, it has to be done in ways that are fair and transparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with targeted incentives is that they are little more than transfers of wealth to a handful of powerful corporations from all other taxpayers, including other businesses. If the problem is excessive tax burdens on businesses in general, then the solution is broad tax reform that also benefits small business owners, who are more likely to stick around if the regional economy weakens and who are unlikely to hopscotch around the country in search of a bigger tax break.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A bill extending a federal program guaranteeing deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts at federally insured banks easily cleared a procedural hurdle on Tuesday, setting it up for a vote on final passage later this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bill, which is supported by most of the banking industry and by the White House, still faces an uphill battle in the Senate and the House.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate voted 76-20 to continue debate on the bill, which would extend by two years a program created to help stabilize the banking system in the 2008 crisis. It was extended in 2010 until the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managed through the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, the so-called Transaction Account Guarantee program provides unlimited federal deposit insurance to what are known as transaction accounts -- basically noninterest-bearing accounts generally used by businesses for payroll, accounts payable and other immediate needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers at nearly all but the largest financial institutions have pleaded with Congress to extend the program after Dec. 31. About $1.5 trillion in transaction accounts would be affected, according to the Independent Community Bankers of America, and industry officials said they expected $200 billion to $300 billion to move out of banks if the program ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.D.I.C.'s standard deposit insurance covers amounts up to $250,000 per account, a limit that was raised from $100,000 before the financial crisis. The higher limit was made permanent in 2010; it is not being considered for change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Transaction Account Guarantee program is financed through assessments on banks by the F.D.I.C., similar to the standard deposit insurance program. Taxpayer money could be at risk if the fund did not have enough money to pay the insured accounts, but that has never happened. The F.D.I.C. says that accounts covered by transaction guarantee program have accounted for 3 percent of all losses because of bank failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program is critically important to the smallest community banks, Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and supporter of the bill, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. ''This program allows these institutions to serve the banking needs of the small businesses in their communities, keeping deposits local,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But procedural moves by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, have left the bill's future uncertain. Immediately after the 76-20 approval to move the bill forward, Mr. Reid said he would not allow any amendments to the bill, something Republicans oppose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides were still negotiating on whether amendments to the bill would be allowed. If an agreement is not reached, it is unlikely that Senate Republicans will help provide the 60 votes needed for the bill to pass the next procedural milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate is occurring against the backdrop of the Senate's fight over its rules regarding the filibuster, which center on whether every bill essentially should continue to require the support of 60 senators -- rather than a simple majority of 51 -- to pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deposit insurance bill could also face a much tougher time in the House, where the mood has been one of allowing the supports and bailout programs put in place during the financial crisis to expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the extension is being supported by the powerful <span class="companylink">American Bankers Association</span> and by the Independent Community Bankers of America, it is opposed by the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents roughly 100 of the largest financial institutions, including banks, mutual fund companies and other asset managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts say the big banks oppose the extension because they figure they are viewed by many depositors as too big to fail. ''They basically are saying, 'No one views us as a failure risk and so our clients are not going to flee,' '' said Joshua Siegel, managing principal of <span class="companylink">StoneCastle Partners</span>, an asset management firm that invests in banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community bankers say their ability to make loans to small businesses will suffer if the program is withdrawn. Cynthia Blankenship, vice chairwoman of <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span> in Grapevine, Tex., a Dallas suburb, said that about 15 percent of its $350 million in assets were protected under the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think all of our deposits under the program would go away if it expired,'' she said. ''But a lot of them will convert to interest-bearing accounts, which cost us more and drives up the price of credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, the <span class="companylink">Credit Union National Association</span> opposes the extension, putting its relatively small institutions on the same side as behemoths like <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. Credit unions are trying to expand their lending to small businesses, and think ending the guarantee program would put them on a more level playing field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''TAG is a crisis-inspired program which Congress intended to be temporary,'' Bill Cheney, president of the credit union association, wrote in a letter to Senate leaders. ''The crisis is over. The program should expire.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's comptroller, John C. Liu, bellowed that the hourly minimum wage should be raised to $11.50. He vowed to crack down on ''corporate welfare'' while endorsing tax cuts for small businesses. And he offered a ringing endorsement of mandatory paid sick leave to ''help the working poor climb out of poverty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Liu wanted to test a few populist themes for what is likely to be an underdog mayoral bid next year, then he found an enthusiastic crowd of roughly 850 elected officials, labor leaders and community activists on whom to try them out Thursday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York should be a city where working men and women can afford to make ends meet and support their families,'' he said, during a 50-minute speech at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice that he billed as a State of the City address, mimicking the mayor's traditional prerogative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Liu was hardly carrying out an exercise in civic tradition. After all, there have only been two State of the City addresses delivered by a comptroller in city history, and both were by Mr. Liu within the last 10 months. A former comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, wrote in an e-mail that she did not ''know the motivation of his speech'' because ''as comptroller, I think I strayed once or twice over the border of simple financial issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, the speech, which was supplemented by pageantry and artistic performances, underscored Mr. Liu's determination to show that he has not been distracted by a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising that is likely to intensify in February, when two of his main allies are scheduled to stand trial for fraud. Mr. Liu did not even refer to the scandal -- unlike 10 months ago, when he joked that his title had been changed to ''embattled,'' and that he needed to get better coverage from The New York Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Liu is evidently crossing his fingers that the scandal does not deepen, so that he is in a position to challenge other likely Democratic mayoral candidates, including Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; Bill de Blasio, the public advocate; and William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other ideas, Mr. Liu suggested raising the minimum wage over the next five years to $11.50 per hour, from the current $7.25 per hour. He proposed to eliminate the city's general corporation tax for businesses with annual city tax bills of under $5,000. He advocated free tuition at the <span class="companylink">City University of New York</span> to the top 10 percent of public school students. And he railed against Madison Square Garden receiving a property tax exemption of $15 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu's leverage is minimal, however, since most of his demands need state approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reviews of the speech were mixed. Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic political consultant who is not affiliated with any mayoral campaign, said he felt that Mr. Liu fell short because his ideas were not particularly original, or within the comptroller's purview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Liu, there's a higher bar, because it's an attempt to demonstrate complete normalcy with a situation that many people in the city are looking at as entirely not normal,'' he said. ''If the idea isn't seen as new, fresh and doable, I think that the chattering class casts a very skeptical eye.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Liu clearly enjoyed the moment, lingering to pose for pictures. Asked by a reporter whether he would announce his mayoral campaign soon, Mr. Liu laughed and said, ''I'm just elated that you are here today.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Jobs Act became law in April, supporters proclaimed a new era for small businesses seeking to raise money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''game changer,'' as President Obama put it in the Rose Garden as he signed the bill, was a provision to let small companies ''crowdfund'' -- that is, sell stock and other securities over the Internet directly to the public. ''For the first time,'' the president said, ''ordinary Americans will be able to go online and invest in entrepreneurs that they believe in.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it now seems that dawn will break late on this new age of democratic investing. The <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> appears certain to miss its end-of-year deadline for issuing regulations to put the provision into effect. And with the departure of the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, and three of her top deputies -- including two who manage the offices writing the regulations -- some in the nascent equity crowdfunding industry worry that it could be 2014 before their line of business becomes legal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay has frustrated many crowdfunding backers. The 270 days that Congress gave the S.E.C. to write the rules ''is not a suggested timeline; it is a Congressional mandate,'' said Kim Wales, an organizer at Crowdfund Intermediary Regulatory Advocates, a lobbying group formed in April to represent the new industry, in an e-mailed statement. ''The S.E.C. answers to Congress, not the other way around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crowdfunding provision, Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, creates an exception to the general rule that before a company can sell its stock to the public, it must register with the S.E.C., a process of disclosure requiring elaborate and expensive assistance from lawyers, accountants and investment bankers that most small companies cannot afford. Instead, businesses seeking less than $1 million will be able to raise capital online from small investors in a streamlined process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the law insists on strong investor protections, and as a result, the S.E.C. must iron out numerous issues concerning how crowdfunding companies, the intermediaries handling the transactions and even investors themselves can operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses, especially start-ups, are notoriously risky; in essence, the S.E.C. is writing rules that will govern a very dangerous game. ''It's actually a significant job to do the regulations in this area, so it was an unrealistic expectation that the S.E.C. would have it completed by now,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span>, which is lobbying the agency on other aspects of the Jobs Act. ''I think they have 21 or 22 separate regulations to write.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S.E.C. employees began accepting comments from and arranging meetings with interested members of the public about crowdfunding shortly after the Jobs Act became law. In those meetings, agency officials ''have come in with our white papers fully highlighted, line by line, to discuss it,'' said Alon Hillel-Tuch, co-founder and chief financial officer at RocketHub, a crowdfunding site that lets people and businesses raise money through donations or by offering rewards. (Current law allows sites to accept donations or deposits on a product.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who largely wrote the crowdfunding measure, said that the S.E.C. was grappling with the more stringent requirements courts had imposed for conducting cost-benefit analyses when writing regulations. This ''has slowed down everything from Dodd-Frank to the Jobs Act,'' the spokeswoman, Courtney Warner Crowell, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With data for analyzing equity crowdfunding in short supply, the S.E.C. asked RocketHub and Indiegogo, another donation-based crowdfunding service, to provide information about their operating practices and campaigns they had conducted. RocketHub complied, Mr. Hillel-Tuch said. But Indiegogo did not, said Slava Rubin, the company's chief executive, because it did not want to share trade secrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hillel-Tuch said S.E.C. officials also requested help from Kickstarter, another leading crowdfunding site. Officials spoke with a Kickstarter executive in July, but neither the agency nor Kickstarter would comment on the meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Title III, companies wishing to sell stock to the public will have to provide information to investors and the S.E.C., including financial disclosures that grow more extensive as the size of the offerings increases. They will be allowed to sell stock only through an intermediary: either a broker-dealer or a specialized crowdfunding Web site, or portal. The intermediaries will have to take steps to ensure that small investors are protected, even from themselves. The law limits how much a person can invest in crowdfunding in a year, depending on income and net worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for both investors and members of the crowdfunding industry have dissected nearly every element of the legislation. ''I think there are probably 25 or 30 legitimately important issues,'' said Douglas S. Ellenoff, a New York securities lawyer who is advising some in the industry. ''But I think they've all been hashed out. They have heard issues from a variety of angles, and I think that the draft proposals are fairly advanced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High on the list of priorities for the portals is to make sure they face less scrutiny from regulators than broker-dealers do. ''What we're asking for is the funding portals are viewed as sort of a broker-dealer-lite sort of model, where the mandates for broker-dealers are not imposed on a funding portal,'' said Ms. Wales, the crowdfunding lobbyist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crowdfunding interests are also warning regulators that some of the stringent investor protection measures could, if fully adopted, make crowdfunding prohibitively expensive. The law, for example, requires intermediaries to ''make such efforts as the commission determines appropriate'' to verify that investors have not exceeded their investment limits, across all intermediaries and stock issuers. But would-be intermediaries fear the prospect of having to confirm this independently, which could entail checking tax forms or creating a database of all investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is likewise taking aim at a requirement that issuers raising more than $500,000 provide investors with audited financial statements. ''If you're a new business and you have to submit audited financials that you don't have yet, it doesn't make sense,'' said Mr. Hillel-Tuch of RocketHub. The law gives the S.E.C. discretion to change this threshold, and Mr. Hillel-Tuch argued that no business seeking to crowdfund should be subject to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calling the requirement unrealistic, Indiegogo's Mr. Rubin said, ''There's no question that this is a massive deal breaker.'' He urged regulators to tread lightly. ''There's a lot to do here, but why not let the industry figure it out?'' he said. ''Along the way there will be some ups and downs, but in the long run, like the Internet, we'll have created an amazing industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor protection advocates remain concerned about those downs. ''The thing about crowdfunding is that it brings together unsophisticated issuers with unsophisticated investors,'' said Ms. Roper of the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span>. ''What could possibly go wrong?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An S.E.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of the rules. This month, Mr. Merkley and several other legislators wrote to Ms. Schapiro, who stepped down on Dec. 14, to urge the agency to propose rules putting the crowdfunding legislation into effect ''in the most expeditious manner possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside observers can only guess at what the commissioners -- now two Democrats and two Republicans -- will do next. But crowdfunding proponents say they remain optimistic, in part because they feel they have developed a good working relationship with their regulators at the S.E.C. ''I believe that with the dialogue we have had with the staff, we will see proposed rules that facilitate a responsible emerging industry with a viable economic model,'' said Mr. Ellenoff, the securities lawyer. ''I've been involved in other programs where I don't feel the same way.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RYAN CALDBECK was stumped. A director at a private equity firm, he was taking part in a panel discussion at a consumer goods conference last summer in New York when an entrepreneur raised his hand with a question: Where could a young company with just a few million dollars in sales go for money to grow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caldbeck and his peers on the panel fumbled for a response. The fact is, most private equity investors and venture capitalists won't touch a consumer products company until it has surpassed $10 million in sales -- anything else is too small to bother with.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best advice the panel could offer was for the entrepreneur to tap his credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The purpose of the panel was to help entrepreneurs raise money, but we had no answers,'' Mr. Caldbeck remembers. ''That's when I knew that there is a big issue here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That big issue caused Mr. Caldbeck to leave his job to start <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span>, a company that aims to connect up-and-coming consumer products companies with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the people allowed to invest through <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> must be accredited, meaning they have a high net worth. <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> hopes that soon not just the wealthy few, but the general public -- whether friends, family members, customers, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friends, or even total strangers -- will be able to invest in deserving companies through a hot new area of finance known as crowdfunding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To its advocates, crowdfunding is a way for capital-starved entrepreneurs to receive financing that neither big investors nor lenders are willing or able to provide. To others, it represents a potential minefield that could help bad businesses get off the ground before they eventually fail, and in some cases could even ensnare unsophisticated investors in outright fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those fears are partly why the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> has delayed rules allowing crowdfunding that were supposed to take effect this month as part of the JOBS Act (Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups), signed by President Obama last April. The S.E.C. is wary of loosening investor protections that have been in place since the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the uncertainty, the outlines of a new industry are emerging as a few crowdfunding start-ups have found ways to raise money within current rules. They include companies like <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> and SoMoLend, which lends money to small, Main Street-type businesses that typically wouldn't interest private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By themselves, of course, a few start-ups can't completely democratize finance. But they begin to illuminate what the future of crowdfunding could look like, as the debate continues over a vast widening of the private investor pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caldbeck formed <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> last fall along with Rory Eakin, a former business school classmate who was working for a philanthropic foundation. Through their start-up, the two men seek to finance food, personal care, apparel and pet-related companies, often with an environmental or social bent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> considers applications from companies with $1 million to $10 million in revenue. Companies whose applications are accepted make their pitches to investors behind a firewall on the <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> Web site, offering equity stakes in return for capital. <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span>, which helps companies raise up to $3 million, takes a small cut of the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under current federal regulations, <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> wouldn't be able to arrange such deals on its own. But it struck a partnership with W. R. Hambrecht, a registered broker-dealer that can handle investments from accredited, or high-net-worth, individuals whom the S.E.C. considers sophisticated enough to invest in private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Living here in Silicon Valley, a lot of people don't understand the need,'' Mr. Caldbeck says. ''If you're a tech company with a good idea, you can raise money. But it's a different story for food, agriculture, retail and other consumer-oriented businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caldbeck sees a big opportunity. Consumer goods companies account for a sizable portion of the nation's businesses, yet very little capital -- from private equity funds or from accredited investors -- flows to them, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, only a tiny percentage of those who qualify as accredited investors actually invest in private companies, he says. (These are people with a net worth of at least $1 million, not including their primary residence, or who have earned more than $200,000 -- $300,000 for couples -- in each of the last two years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> is aiming to simplify the process so that more accredited investors take the plunge and more start-ups can get financing. And it wants to expand its business to unaccredited investors when the rules for crowdfunding are completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> has helped seven companies raise money on its site. They include Episencial, a children's organic skin care line based in Los Angeles; Laloo's, a maker of goat milk ice cream in Petaluma, Calif.; and Little Duck Organics, a children's snack producer in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zak Normandin, 26, the tousled-haired founder of Little Duck Organics, got the money to start his business the way many small businesses do: by maxing out credit cards. He ran the company out of his basement and distributed products himself to local stores before winning his first big client: Whole Foods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, he and nine employees operate out of offices in a brick warehouse in the Greenpoint area of Brooklyn. His goal has been to create healthy snacks and cereals that he would serve to his own three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no healthy fun alternative for kids,'' Mr. Normandin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's first product -- Tiny Fruits, a line of no-sugar-added organic fruit snacks -- can be found in 6,000 retail outlets, including Whole Foods and Stop &amp; Shop stores and on <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>. Mighty Oats, a new cereal line packaged in compostable containers, will hit stores this month. There are juices, fruit purées and other products in the works, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that takes capital -- lots of it. Yet fund-raising takes valuable time away from running the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> has given entrepreneurs like Mr. Normandin a streamlined way to raise money while providing investors with opportunities they may not otherwise hear about. In seven weeks, Little Duck raised nearly $900,000 from about a dozen investors on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pre-<span class="companylink">CircleUp</span>, 80 percent of my time during fund-raising was spent with investors,'' Mr. Normandin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> fund-raising brought more than money. A few investors with experience in building and marketing consumer brands have become informal advisers to Mr. Normandin. ''To have that kind of experience to leverage has been extremely helpful,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another draw is that <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> has partnered with corporations like <span class="companylink">General Mills</span>, which get an early look at new brands they might want to acquire down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> itself has attracted $1.5 million from big-name investors including Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chairman, through his Maveron venture fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another supporter is Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor known for his work on what is called disruptive innovation; he invested in <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> through his Rose Park Advisors investment firm. (Professor Christensen says that seemingly simple innovations can disrupt and displace mainstays in a market the way the personal computer disrupted the mainframe market and smartphones are now disrupting PCs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CircleUp</span>, and crowdfunding in general, have ''the potential to be disruptive,'' Professor Christensen says, by opening up financing to companies that have traditionally struggled to raise capital and to investors who have been excluded from the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOMOLEND, a crowdfunding start-up based in Cincinnati with offices in New York City, is focused on a more modest, but ultimately larger, market: the millions of small businesses that dot the nation's Main Streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These businesses usually rely on financing from friends and family, home equity loans, credit cards and bank loans. Yet all of those financing sources suffered greatly during the financial crisis and in many cases have not yet recovered. While overall commercial lending has rebounded, bank lending to small businesses is still down significantly from 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the crowdfunding focus has been on equity -- selling shares in start-ups -- but SoMoLend is betting that loans to expanding small businesses are a bigger opportunity. Equity crowdfunding will be ''minuscule compared to the impact crowdfunding will have on debt financing,'' says Candace Klein, SoMoLend's founder and C.E.O. ''We think this is literally going to change the banking system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing a recent <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> report, Ms. Klein says that nearly a third of small businesses don't apply for bank loans for fear of rejection. Of those that do apply, two-thirds are turned down, leaving them in need of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the market that SoMoLend -- short for Social Mobile Local Lending -- was created to serve. Ms. Klein's experience with her first start-up, a Cincinnati-based firm that mentors and makes microloans to entrepreneurial women, made her clearly aware of the need, she said. But how to serve that market as crowdfunding worked its way through the legislative -- and now the regulatory -- process? Ms. Klein had an idea: instead of raising money from a group of individual investors, she would seek out institutions to serve as lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her first partner was <span class="companylink">KeyBank</span>, a regional bank based in Cleveland, which helped test the site and develop an underwriting algorithm. Today, SoMoLend counts more than 40 institutions among its lenders, including <span class="companylink">Fifth Third Bank</span>, the Emery Federal Credit Union, the <span class="companylink">Bank of Kentucky</span> and Justine Petersen, a nonprofit microlender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Klein says she offers an efficient way for lenders to find loan candidates and to team up so they can reduce their risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With SoMoLend, ''we can query and filter the types of businesses we're interested in'' and ''only take on the risk that we are comfortable with,'' says Britt Scearce, a business development officer at Emery. In addition, local governments like the City of Cincinnati and St. Louis County, Mo., have signed on, seeing the service as a way to spur economic development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since SoMoLend started about a year ago, it has eased the way for $3.4 million in loans to 89 small-business borrowers, typically retailers, restaurants, salons and other concerns that have inventory and equipment that can be used as collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers have included Candice Peters, who raised $9,000 from three lenders to help with working capital for her two-year-old Hyde Park Body Boutique, a workout studio in the Hyde Park section of Cincinnati. She now employs six instructors and says she hopes to open a second studio in another part of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's Stacey Shiring, owner of Creative Invites and Events, a Cincinnati shop that creates custom stationery and invitations from designs by local artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shiring, who is 34, obtained a $15,000 loan, at 6 percent interest, from Key Bank through SoMoLend. She used the loan to develop software that will allow customers to design stationery online; she plans to license the software to other stationers. As she began building a history of loan repayment on SoMoLend, she was able to secure a $50,000 line of credit from her bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shiring says her business is profitable, and she now employs five full-time and two part-time employees. ''It's hard to open a small business, and SoMoLend has made it a little easier for us,'' she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding sites like SoMoLend aim to act as a kind of financial launching pad. ''Crowdfunding can get companies started to the point where they can get bank financing down the road,'' says Mr. Scearce of Emery Credit Union. ''We're excited about what this can do for the economy -- it can get a lot of companies up and running. And we're excited to be in on the ground floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, Ms. Klein formed a partnership with Gate Global Impact, a broker-dealer based in New York, that allows SoMoLend to add accredited investors, as well as family members and friends, to its mix of lenders. That paves the way for what she calls ''leveraged loans,'' so that institutional lenders can feel more confident knowing that a borrower who has raised money from friends and family has some ''skin in the game.'' It also moves her closer to her goal of enabling ordinary investors to ''invest in the products, people and companies that they already know and love.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HER hope is shared by dozens of other start-ups that geared up after President Obama signed the JOBS Act. One of the law's crucial provisions allows private companies to sell shares to the public over the Internet, but it stipulates that such investments take place on a new type of Web site known as a ''funding portal.'' The S.E.C. was given until the end of 2012 to flesh out the legislation with detailed rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, last spring, the race to reinvent finance for the Internet age was on. With their eye on early 2013, dozens of ambitious start-ups began preparing their crowdfunding portals. They watched the stunning success of sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which have helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, and they vowed to do the same for entrepreneurs. (Donation- and rewards-based crowdfunding is not covered by securities laws, which kick in only when a financial return is promised.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those dreams have been stalled, if not exactly extinguished. The S.E.C., sensitive to critics of the new law, has missed its year-end deadline. Turnover at the top of the agency -- Mary L. Schapiro left as chairwoman in December, and a permanent replacement has not been named -- could further slow progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., wrote in an e-mail that the agency had been working very hard on crowdfunding rules and had said both before and after the JOBS Act was enacted that the year-end deadline was unrealistic for such a complex issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will continue working hard amid a busy rule-making agenda to get these crowdfunding rules done as soon as possible and to get them done right -- with the appropriate investor protections in place,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding portals, meanwhile, are recalibrating their business plans as they operate in a holding pattern. Many people estimate that actual crowdfunding might not occur until early 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For crowdfunding entrepreneurs, ''it's going to be a long, cold winter and spring,'' says D. J. Paul, a former securities professional who was a co-founder of a portal called Crowdfunder and now advises others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the S.E.C. struggles to balance protection for investors with increased access to capital for small businesses, some advocates of crowdfunding worry that the idea's promise will be stifled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slava Rubin, the C.E.O. of Indiegogo, says, ''I'm very concerned about the idea of the government stopping this before it has ever had the chance to get off its feet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rubin, whose company is considering expanding into investment-style crowdfunding once the new rules are completed, says he fears that regulations will be so complex that crowdfunding -- at least as envisioned -- ''will be too burdensome to execute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, the delay reflects the fact that crowdfunding poses risks. Small businesses and start-ups, after all, have a high failure rate. Even advocates concede that there will almost certainly be examples of fraud and failure when crowdfunding takes hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one should expect that it will be flawless,'' Mr. Rubin says. ''As the saying goes, you've got to break some eggs to make an omelet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thom Ruhe, vice president for entrepreneurship at the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span>, says: ''I'm absolutely certain there will be fraud in the crowdfunding space -- it's just too attractive for people with nefarious intent, which is why I hope the S.E.C. is taking all this time to get it right.'' He favors prominent investor warnings on crowdfunding sites and an emphasis on investor education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My biggest concern is when, not if, these fraudulent actions are discovered, that there won't be an overreaction,'' he says. He offers this analogy: If a bank is robbed in Chicago, you don't shut down banks everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, he says, crowdfunding will broaden the pool of capital available to entrepreneurs and bolster the economy. ''The movement behind crowdfunding is a market response to a market reality,'' says Mr. Ruhe, referring to the financial crisis, which caused banks to rein in lending and to deny lines of credit to many healthy small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE JOBS Act contains investor protections. For example, legislators capped the amount that unaccredited investors can invest through crowdfunding in a given year to $2,000, or 5 percent of their income, whichever is greater. Also, businesses that raise money on crowdfunding portals must disclose relevant financial information; for companies seeking more than $500,000, that includes audited figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creators of the new Web portals, meanwhile, have been offering crowdfunding conferences and boot camps, holding business-plan competitions and hosting fund-raising campaigns that allow companies to solicit donations but not investments. Others are re-evaluating whether they want to be involved in what may ultimately be a highly regulated industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One high-profile entrepreneur, Adam Draper, has already thrown in the towel. His start-up, BoostFunder, had planned to create an online marketplace for start-ups and investors when he introduced it last year. But, citing regulatory red tape, Mr. Draper shifted gears and turned BoostFunder into a conventional Silicon Valley incubator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eakin of <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span> continues to work with accredited investors as the S.E.C. completes its work on crowdfunding. ''We're still optimistic about the potential for crowdfunding writ large,'' he says. ''It's been a longer process than many of us had hoped, but one that in the end we think will be a good thing for the country over all.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we begin the New Year, I thought I would share some perspectives on where I think we stand in terms of access to capital and what I think will happen with small-business lending in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part, my perspective comes from reading various reports about the state of small-business lending. These reports, however, don't tell the whole story. For example, the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> releases numbers that apply only to S.B.A.-backed loans. And the data that comes from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> about bank lending activity includes credit card loans. Meanwhile, the alternative lenders don't release any aggregate numbers at all.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This makes it hard to get a clear picture of what's happening. Obviously, no one person or company has a handle on all of the credit markets, but as a loan broker, I speak every day to business owners who are trying to borrow money and bankers who say they want to lend it. Here is what I see happening on the front lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're trying to start a business today, you can almost forget about going to a bank for financing. This situation hasn't changed much in the past year, and we don't see it changing any time soon - with a few exceptions. If you are opening a franchise outlet that is on the approved S.B.A. list or if you have solid personal collateral outside of your new business, you've got a shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, frustrations about the difficulties involved in financing start-ups resulted in a lot of political capital being focused on one possible solution, crowdfunding. Unfortunately, crowdfunding hasn't taken off yet, and I don't think it will in 2013. It will take time to iron out the kinks and figure out how to make it work - how to strike the right balance between helping companies and protecting investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a happier note, things have definitely gotten better for companies that are clearly creditworthy. In 2012, if you owned an existing business and you had collateral, cash flow and good credit scores, it was a good time to borrow money at low rates. And I think that will continue for some time. Banks are now hunting eagerly for these borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that there are not nearly enough of them. And that's why a group of alternative lenders - including factors and merchant-cash advance lenders - are lined up and ready to supply money to most of the rest of us. The challenge is that these borrowers face high rates that make it tough to grow and expand as much as they would like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alternative financing industry is growing rapidly and, I believe, will continue to grow in 2013. These lenders are extremely entrepreneurial and are leaving the banks behind with their speed and use of technology. Many are backed by premier investment banks and Silicon Valley venture capital powerhouses - investors who understand that entrepreneurs and small-business owners are throwing up their hands in frustration over how long it can take to get a loan from a bank, especially if the loan is backed by the S.B.A. More and more businesses are willing to pay the price of the alternative lenders just to be able to get their capital and move on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some indications that the price of alternative lending may be coming down a bit as the industry gets more competitive. I expect this to continue in 2013. That said, there is still a wide discrepancy in pricing between bank loans and alternative loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the growth of alternative financing, we have heard little from Washington about the challenges small-business owners face when borrowing money. For reasons I still don't understand, access to capital for small-businesses was pretty much a nonissue in last year's presidential campaign. When we do hear from Washington in 2013, I expect the conversation will be mostly about the S.B.A., which is fine as far as it goes. I am all for the S.B.A., but as I have written previously, it represents a tiny piece of the overall puzzle - and should be thought of as such.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest banks continue to tout their small-business lending records, but the numbers they provide to back this up are less than convincing. We regularly speak with small-business development officers at these banks who are ready to throw up their hands in frustration at their inability to get their clients the help they need. My expectation is that this will not change much in 2013, as the bigger banks simply aren't equipped to handle small-business lending and Washington puts little pressure on them to figure it out. Community banks, meanwhile, continue to be friends of small businesses, and relationship banking continues to be critical in completing loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hope that in 2013 we will find ways to break the gridlock. While the economists say the recession is over, many of us in the small-business community are still reeling from the aftershocks. My hope is that in 2013 we will find new ways to get lower priced capital into the hands of more small-business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in November, just after the election - and a thorough debate over how higher taxes might affect small businesses - we started inviting readers to share the intimate details of their businesses' financial conditions. We are particularly interested in exploring the relationship between income taxes and investment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with a "fiscal cliff" deal in place that preserves tax rates for most Americans but raises them for the very wealthy, we present the first of what we hope will be a series of small-business tax profiles - posts that look at how tax policies affect specific businesses. Our first owner, Jed Horovitz, believes - contrary to the claim advanced by many small-business owners - that higher taxes encourage more investment. He made this point in a comment to our October examination of claims Mitt Romney made at the first presidential debate. (We have sought owners with differing view points through such organizations as the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> and the S Corporation Association, both of which strongly opposed any income tax increase.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OWNER AND HIS COMPANY Mr. Horovitz, 62, is president and chief executive of Internet Video Archive, which supplies streaming film trailers to the Web sites of 85 clients (including, as it happens, The New York Times). The company employs 19 people and is based in Haddon Heights, N.J., near Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINANCIALS Mr. Horovitz estimates that the company will have $2 million in revenue in 2012. Its biggest expense - or investment - is employee salaries: about $1.1 million, he said, which does not include Mr. Horovitz's pay. (He said he took his own payment as a draw of profits from the company, which is organized as a limited liability corporation.) To do much of its work, the company uses cloud computing. Storing videos and delivering them to clients in 2012 cost about $200,000. Leased software and other Internet services costs came to $100,000. Given this reliance on Internet-based services, capital expenditures on hardware and owned software was just $50,000. Sales and marketing expenses were $150,000. Rent and other office expenses amounted to $100,000. Insurance and legal costs were $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those expenses totaled about $1.75 million in 2012, leaving Internet Video Archive with a taxable income of about $250,000. However, Mr. Horovitz owns the company's building, so the rent it pays goes to him. And his wife draws a salary as the company's director of marketing and communications. All told, Mr. Horovitz expects his taxable income will reach $450,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE TAX BITE For the past few years, Mr. Horovitz's household income has landed him in the top two tax brackets. "My effective rate has been 25 percent," he said. Using the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>'s ever-useful Tax Calculator, we can estimate how much federal tax he would pay in 2013, assuming his (and his company's) financials do not change a lot. If the Horovitzes take a standard deduction off income of $450,000, then according to the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span> calculator, they will pay $121,576 under the newly enacted American Taxpayer Relief Act, a few hundred dollars more than if the Bush tax cuts had remained in place. (Even though the tax rates remain the same for the Horovitzes, the new law phases out the personal exemptions for married couples making more than $267,200, which adds nearly $3,000 to the couple's regular income tax liability. However, with the Bush tax cuts still in place, they would also be subject to the alternative minimum tax, which nearly evens things out.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, on the other hand, his household income is $500,000 in 2013, he will pay $140,815, according to the calculator, almost $4,500 more than if the Bush tax cuts had remained in effect. "The marginal difference is not very much, especially as a percent of our expenses or income," Mr. Horovitz said. "Since my particular bracket is right on the edge of this divide, it isn't that big a push to make me spend or save. If a business is deeply impacted by a tax rate of a few percent, it has other, more pressing problems!" (In fact, the Horovitzes itemize their deductions, which further reduces their taxable income and would presumably result in lower taxes under either situation produced by the tax calculator.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as tax breaks go, Mr. Horovitz said, "I take what's available." But, he added, "I don't devote too much time to it, in terms of planning ahead. My accountant once said to me, 'If you're making money and paying taxes, it's a good thing.' You don't want to waste your life figuring out how not to pay more taxes. Spend your time trying to make more money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AND THE IMPACT ON INVESTMENT In Mr. Horovitz's view, small-business owners are being disingenuous when they claim that higher taxes would discourage further investment in their companies. "It's true if you wait until the end of the year, and you're talking about the money that's been taxed, then of course you have less after taxes. But if you spend it before it's taxed, it reduces the taxes you pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're not really thinking long term, and they're not thinking sustainably," he continued. "That's not a very aggressive way of running a business. It's a timid way of running a business. And I don't think it's what they really do - they're not timid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horovitz said that he is eager to expand Internet Video Archive because the company is finally able to take advantage of economies of scale. "We've just gotten to a tipping point in the last couple years," he said. "Because our expenses have really been the same, but our revenues were $1.5 million, or one-and-a-quarter million." Before 2012, when he drew up a budget, he estimated his pretax income would come to about $300,000. "We grew more than I expected," he said. "I wish that I had come up with more ways to invest in my company over the year. And as I'm doing the budget for next year, I'm planning on spending more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, Mr. Horovitz plans to spend an additional $100,000 to $200,000. "We're spending more on marketing travel, to reach out and find new customers," he said. He plans to hire two additional people - "people who aren't necessary to service the business I've got, but to grow the business." And, he added, "I've given people raises because we grew more than expected and I think part of that is their productivity went up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horovitz said: "People say higher taxes are a disincentive to investment - yes, if this is your last year in business. But if it's not your last year in business, it's an incentive to investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a business owner and an employer, and you're willing to talk openly about your finances, your taxes, and your investment plans, we'd like to hear from you. Please e-mail The Agenda and let us know you're interested.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pebble, the much-hyped wristwatch designed to connect wirelessly to smartphones to display information like text messages, whipped the Web into a frenzy last May when the project raised more than $10 million through Kickstarter, one of the crowdfunding platform's largest campaigns to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the Pebble created almost as much of a stir when the company hit several delays during production, provoking frustration and ire among the 68,000 people who had pledged their money in exchange for a watch.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Wednesday, Eric Migicovsky, the primary engineer behind the idea, promised that the company would begin shipping watches on Jan. 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The models coming off the line look great and software is looking good," he said in an interview late Tuesday night. "We're just ready to get them out in the wild."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Migicovsky officially announced the news at a conference in Las Vegas during the International Consumer Electronics Show, where he also showed off the final design and gave a demonstration of the features and interface of the watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company originally promised that the watches would begin shipping last September, roughly four months after the project was first announced. Its creators expected to receive no more than a few thousand orders from customers. Instead, they were flooded with demand, ultimately taking orders for 85,000 watches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pebble took off faster and larger than we ever expected and we had to switch to a Plan B, which consisted of a more traditional consumer product manufacturing process," said Mr. Migicovsky. The company worked with a manufacturer in China, instead of producing them in Silicon Valley, as they'd planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scaling the operation was a bigger challenge than expected, and included tweaks to product molds that were used on the production line. The company decided to hold off on announcing a new date until they were confident that the final product was robust enough to ship to their customers. The company's software engineers have been busy tweaking the watch's operating system and getting it ready to ship out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you are making a couple thousand watches you can afford a few missteps," he said. "But when you're making 85,000 watches you have to make sure every piece of the puzzle fits together."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Migicovsky said "tens of thousands" more watches had been pre-ordered through the Pebble's online storefront, but the company would not begin shipping those out until all of their Kickstarter orders had been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pebble watch first appeared on the Kickstarter site with the modest goal of raising $100,000 in a month. It attracted much attention for its sleek e-paper display that is optimized for reading in sunlight and can deliver text messages and alerts to bikers and hikers who do not want to risk injury pulling out their phones. The founders also promise the watches will be able to withstand wet weather conditions, including rain and snow and being submerged underwater. The watches will come in several bright colors, including orange and red, and can work with other smartphone applications. Mr. Migicovsky said the Pebble watches would contain a compass and an ambient light sensor. In addition, the company worked to ensure that their software could be updated over the air, and Mr. Migicovsky said that he anticipated releasing updates every two to three weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've thrown our hats into the ring and held up pretty well," he said. "We're proud to see our products alongside others in the market."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDSAN FRANCISCO -- Call it the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> effect. Until recently, investors had been all too eager to pour millions into any Web start-up with rapid growth, regardless of whether it made money or even had plans to do so down the road. But after <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s rocky initial public offering and flameouts at <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> and Groupon, venture capitalists are entering a picky phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Earlier, entrepreneurs didn't need a real monetization strategy,'' said Brian O'Malley, an early investor at <span class="companylink">Battery Ventures</span>. ''They could punt on revenue indefinitely because their investment dollars were their revenue. They could fund their start-ups with funding versus customers.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No longer favored are e-commerce start-ups, which face logistical hurdles and require a lot of money. The celebrated shift to smartphones, once welcomed with an outpouring of investments, is now making some investors nervous as monetization proves harder for mobile devices than it did for the Web.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have also grown weary of start-ups and applications that rely entirely on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and LinkedIn for customers, now that those companies are focused on their own bottom lines. And Silicon Valley is discovering that while it may be easier than ever to start a company, it is harder than ever to build an enduring business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger start-ups are beginning to feel the pinch. CB Insights, a research firm, analyzed 4,056 initial, or seed, investments made in tech start-ups in the United States since 2009. It found that more than 1,000 start-ups that attracted seed financing from angel investors -- wealthy investors who put in money from their own pockets -- will find themselves orphaned this year when venture capitalists reject their requests for more money. As a result, $1 billion in angel investments will evaporate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That carnage hardly compares to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, when $3 trillion was lost on the Nasdaq, but it is enough to give Internet investors and entrepreneurs pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CB Insights predicts that Internet start-ups will be the hardest hit, because they have attracted more seed money than enterprise and hardware companies but will most likely have a harder time securing follow-up investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem is simple math. Angel investors seed businesses with small sums, often less than $1.5 million. But to grow a business, entrepreneurs eventually have to solicit financing from the venture capitalists who invest on behalf of endowments, pension funds, foundations and the like. And while the number of angels eager to write checks has increased, the number of active venture capitalists has decreased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors say it is not just the bottleneck that is to blame. The realities of building an enduring business are starting to sink in. ''It has never been easier to start a company, and never harder to build one,'' said David Lee, a venture capitalist at SV Angel, an early-stage investment firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David O. Sacks, a Silicon Valley executive who sold Yammer to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> for $1.2 billion last year, summed up the challenges in a bearish note on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think Silicon Valley as we know it may be coming to an end,'' Mr. Sacks wrote. ''To create a successful new company,'' he said, entrepreneurs have to find an idea that ''has escaped the attention of the major Internet companies, which are better run than before.'' To attract follow-up money, new companies now have to prove themselves for less than $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, they must be ''protectable from the onslaught of those big companies once they figure out what you're on to,'' Mr. Sacks said. ''How many ideas like that are left?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sacks's comments were widely debated within Silicon Valley. One of his most vocal critics was Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and of Andreessen-Horowitz, a venture capital firm, who said on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> that the opportunities for start-ups were ''unending.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But start-ups are finding that their supply of capital is not. ''The valuations got ahead of themselves,'' said Rich Wong, a venture investor at <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>. ''Where people only paid attention to multiple quarters, now they are looking more than a year ahead for projected results.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wong said e-commerce companies in particular were drawing closer scrutiny. Investors who took note of Amazon's $1.2 billion acquisition of Zappos and its $540 million purchase of Quidsi, the owner of Diapers.com, poured millions into e-commerce sites, only to discover that they are difficult to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gilt <span class="companylink">Groupe</span>, a flash deal site for fashion, raised some $220 million in capital but is still not profitable. Last year, the company was forced to cut staff. It is scaling back on smaller brands like Gilt Taste and Park &amp; Bond, and it has put Jetsetter, its popular online travel site, up for sale. Fab.com, a daily deal site for design, raised money at a lower valuation than it had planned because of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s troubled I.P.O. Investors also predict that Zulily, a flash deal site for mothers, will have a hard time justifying its recent $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ShoeDazzle</span>, Kim Kardashian's shoe site, raised $66 million and Lot18, a flash deal site for wine, raised $45 million from investors impressed with their user growth. Both companies were forced to make staff cuts last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am skeptical of 'Commerce 2.0,' which has come to mean daily deals and discounts,'' said Peter Fenton, a venture partner at <span class="companylink">Benchmark Capital</span>. Mr. Fenton said flash sites like Zulily and Gilt ''are capital-intensive, face structural challenges to their margins, and if they do go public, they trade at low multiples. Plus, I seriously question their ability to compete with a juggernaut like Amazon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, investors are becoming skeptical of social games and applications that build on social networks like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and LinkedIn. These social networks are a shaky foundation for a business because they themselves are feeling pressure to monetize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> made tweaks to its newsfeed algorithm last fall that reduced the number of users who can view <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> status updates. The company said it made the tweaks to serve its users more relevant content, but advertisers complained that the changes cut the audience for their posts in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real impetus for the change, advertisers say, was to force companies to use <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s new promotion feature, which gives users the option to pay to ensure their updates reach a wider audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BranchOut, a professional network that culled data from LinkedIn and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, raised $49 million from venture investors but had to change its business model in 2011 after LinkedIn cut off access to its data. More recently, Tweetro, a <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> application for Windows 8, was removed from the market in November after it outgrew <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s new third-party user limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors are getting smarter about the sources of traffic,'' said Mr. O'Malley of <span class="companylink">Battery Ventures</span>. ''Companies that rely heavily on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, or mobile, are having a tougher time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital investments in mobile companies were up 75 percent in the first nine months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011, according to CB Insights, but developers face different challenges on smartphones than they did on the Web.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was so much hype around the transition to mobile, but people are realizing that mobile is challenging,'' Mr. O'Malley said. Among the obstacles is the fact that developers are subject to Apple's whims. Also, they must persuade people to download their apps, and advertising is more complicated on a smaller screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So which consumer start-ups are likely to survive the chopping block?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are looking more seriously at engagement metrics,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''What percent of your users are coming back? How engaged are they? Are they a 'sticky' user?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dose of reality may be healthy. Mr. Lee of SV Angel said that 18 months ago, every other business pitch he heard was social, local or mobile. Today, he sees more diverse company ideas and more durable, predictable business models.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now companies that have a predictable business model, or a way of getting engaged users, and global, addressable markets are the companies getting the lofty valuations,'' Mr. Lee said. But, he added, ''that's making me more cheap.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 15, 2013, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a tightening of financing for Web start-ups misstated the amount of investor financing raised by BranchOut, a professional network start-up. It has raised $49 million, not $85 million.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National health care spending has been rising at an unusually low rate for three consecutive years. Yet health insurance companies in some states with lax regulations are requesting and winning double-digit premium increases for some customers. That jarring discrepancy suggests that both the federal government and the states need more power to reject premium increases that can't be justified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Affordable Care Act requires that proposed premium increases of 10 percent or more for small businesses and for individuals who lack employer coverage must be reviewed by state or federal regulators to determine if they are reasonable. Most states can reject increases found to be unjustifiable. But some states cannot; they simply rely on public disclosure to deter insurers from getting too greedy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in California, which lacks the power to deny excessive rate increases, three major insurers are proposing premium rate increases for 2013 of as much as 20 percent, 22 percent, and 26 percent for some policyholders. In New York, however, the rate increases for 2013 are far lower than what insurers requested because state law allows state regulators to roll back unjustified increases. For individual policies, the insurers sought an average 9.5 percent increase but were granted only 4.5 percent. For small groups, insurers asked for 15.8 percent but were approved for 9.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the slow rate of growth in national health spending -- a modest 3.9 percent annually in 2009, 2010, and 2011, the lowest annual increases in the 52 years the government has been collecting such data -- is good news. But experts don't know whether this is a temporary, recession-related slowdown or a permanent downward trend. Insurers often claim that high premiums for individual policies are driven by rising medical costs in some states and younger and healthier people forgoing insurance in the slow economy, leaving only sick and costly patients signed up for insurance. That rationale should disappear in 2014 when virtually all Americans will be required to buy insurance or pay a penalty.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW ORLEANS -- C. Ray Nagin, the former mayor of this city who fulminated against the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina but became for many a symbol of the shortcomings of government himself, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Friday on 21 counts including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indictment detailed a wide-ranging scheme of kickbacks and pay-for-play of a kind not entirely unfamiliar in Louisiana history. Contractors and vendors looking for work with the city would provide the mayor with vacations, big checks and even free granite for his family business. In exchange, they would be awarded lucrative contracts with the city, assistance in defusing community opposition to their projects and even forgiveness of tax penalties.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While federal prosecutors have convicted a Louisiana governor, a congressman, a city councilman and members of the school board in the past 15 years alone, this is the first time in New Orleans history that a mayor has been indicted on corruption charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nagin's lawyer, Robert Jenkins, did not return a call seeking comment. However, he called a local radio talk show in the afternoon, and in response to a question from the host, John McConnell, known as Spud, suggested that the indictment had come as a surprise amid continuing plea negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well, we were surprised that the indictment came today because we were still talking with the government and in fact we had talked about meeting next week as well,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it came as no surprise here in the city, where people had been expecting an indictment for months. Aside from someone identified only as ''Businessman A,'' the other figures accused of taking part in the conspiracy have either been convicted or pleaded guilty to bribery and corruption charges in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the timing was not a shock, as one of the contractors pleaded guilty in December to paying a $60,000 bribe to ''Public Official A'' on Jan. 30, 2008, which set off a five-year statute of limitations that would have come to a close this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Nagin, 56, had not been officially named as a target of a federal grand jury, the pretense that Public Official A, who showed up in another plea, could be anyone but the mayor had long since been abandoned on local news reports and in conversations around town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for one of the contractors suggested to reporters last month that a person would have to be ''the worst investigative reporter on the planet'' to not know who Public Official A was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has long been a topic of conversation among the political class,'' said Edward E. Chervenak, a professor of political science at the <span class="companylink">University of New Orleans</span>. ''When are the feds going to indict Nagin? Everybody's been waiting for the shoe to fall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nagin came into office in 2002 as an outsider, a reformer out to clean City Hall, a business executive who disdained the old machine politics and was spouting new ideas. It did not take long for him to develop a reputation as a man whose thoughts far outpaced his actions, with ambitious proposals often going nowhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was really a signature problem in his early administration,'' said Stephanie Grace, a former columnist for The Times-Picayune who covered his entire career as mayor. ''It wasn't corruption. It was just things just not happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the inability to act was an unfortunate if tolerable trait in a mayor during normal times, it took on tragic dimensions after Hurricane Katrina, when the very existence of the city was in doubt. New Orleanians scattered around the country looked to the mayor for direction on how the city would rebuild and, while Mr. Nagin frequently offered colorful commentary on the frustrations of recovery, he gave little guidance even on crucial issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He basically made this decision not to decide,'' Ms. Grace said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, though billions of dollars in federal money were coming into New Orleans after Katrina, few initially thought of the mayor as corrupt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not until a series of investigative reports in The Times-Picayune and, in 2010, the guilty plea of Mr. Nagin's chief technology officer, did that conception start changing. According to the indictment, F.B.I. agents had interviewed Mr. Nagin about kickbacks as far back as 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indictment alleges that the mayor began a kickback scheme in June 2004, with an executive order allowing Greg Meffert, the technology officer, to engage a city vendor in a no-bid contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also asserted that Mr. Nagin received kickbacks from the vendor, a man named Mark St. Pierre, who was convicted in the spring of 2011 on 53 corruption-related charges. Mr. Meffert pleaded guilty in 2010 to taking more than $800,000 in bribes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kickbacks from Mr. St. Pierre as well as other contractors included trips on private jets to New York, Chicago, Jamaica and Las Vegas, free cellphone service, campaign contributions and payments of tens of thousands of dollars, some in the form of checks or cash and others in monthly wire transfers, the government alleges. The payments from one contractor continued for months after Mr. Nagin left office, in May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, those paying bribes received multimillion-dollar contracts for reconstruction projects, as well as smaller property management projects in neighborhoods all over a still-struggling city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the bribery, the government alleges, involved Stone Age, a granite countertop business run by Mr. Nagin and his two sons, Jeremy and Jarin. Company accounts would be used to disguise the payoffs, and some of the payoffs came in the form of several shipments of free granite, or coveted business arrangements with local branches of a ''major retail corporation,'' reported to be <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two family members of Mr. Nagin's are mentioned in the indictment as having received bribes, though no one else has been charged. The penalties are hefty: if convicted, Mr. Nagin could face 20 years on each of the nine wire fraud counts alone. His arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nagin's indictment also underscores the impatience with corruption and bad governance that set in after the storm, the levee failures and the large-scale mismanagement that followed. Crooked contractors and inept officials at all levels were hardly rare here, but a citizenry that may have shrugged them off the past has shown far less tolerance since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, who lost to Mr. Nagin in 2006 only to win election in 2010 in part because of widespread voter remorse, issued a statement calling Friday ''a sad day for the city of New Orleans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Public corruption cannot and will not be tolerated,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday morning, Mr. Nagin, who has been living in Texas and who was known internationally during the trying months of fall 2005 for always having something to say about anything, reposted on his <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed a message from someone else, the televangelist Joel Osteen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are closest to your victory,'' it read, ''when you face the greatest opposition.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has changed since Mr. Neufeldt introduced Mr. Obama before a speech in August 2009 at Monaco Coach, a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid him off after 32 years. Once called ''the R.V. capital of the world,'' Elkhart was experiencing the highest unemployment rate in the country after sales began to plummet throughout the automotive industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he was offered his job back, Mr. Neufeldt instead was hired by a company to speak to businesses about green energy and biofuels.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than three months after Sgt. First Class Jared C. Monti received the Medal of Honor for the courage he demonstrated during the firefight in Afghanistan that took his life, Mr. Obama announced his plan to send an additional 30,000 troops there as part of the surge. For Sergeant Monti's father, Paul, there was no question that it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mission in Afghanistan has changed, Mr. Monti said. He supports Mr. Obama's decision to draw down United States forces over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've lost enough,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about his hopes for the president's second term, Mr. Monti grew quiet for a moment. He expressed deep frustration with Congress, which is so gridlocked, he said, that some legislation does not even make it to a vote.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Neither one of us had health insurance, but we had to be sure the kids were taken care of,'' said Rileen Secrest, his wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, Mr. Secrest, 43, died of a heart attack. He was employed again but still uninsured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Secrest, whose county had the highest unemployment rate in Virginia, earned a business degree from a community college in 2011 and found a job as an assistant manager at a restaurant. Although Ms. Secrest thought her husband was healthy, they worried about what could happen without health insurance, she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the specter of empty <span class="companylink">Maytag</span> factories still lingering, the town of Newton, Iowa, welcomed Mr. Obama with cautious hope in April 2009. Trinity Structural Towers, which builds parts for wind turbines, had moved in and started hiring. Richard Mulbrook, who had worked for <span class="companylink">Maytag</span> and had been hired by Trinity, introduced the president for a speech about energy policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like others in the renewable energy business, Trinity benefited from government support. Mr. Mulbrook, who now works for another company after two years at Trinity, said it felt as if the subsidies helped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trinity hired only a fraction of the former <span class="companylink">Maytag</span> work force and, like the rest of the wind industry, faces an uncertain market. Mr. Mulbrook said the town had not fully recovered, with many houses still on the market and people commuting to jobs outside Newton. But he said he remained hopeful that Mr. Obama could repair the damage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Given was overdrawn twice in 18 months and paid $370 in overdraft fees. A visit to the local branch resulted in the reversal of some of the fees, but Mrs. Given said the situation left her flustered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her lawsuit, which is now part of a larger class action, said she could have avoided the fees if the bank had processed her transactions in the order they were made, instead of from largest to smallest -- a common industry practice at the time that critics derided as a scheme to trigger more fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Given said she supported the consumer protections enacted under Mr. Obama and would like to see him do more on behalf of ''regular Americans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're really necessary,'' she said of the protections, ''because you have to give people knowledge about the financial agreements they're getting into and a voice against big financial institutions.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Chapman was struggling to undo a bad mortgage in October 2009 when she met Mr. Obama, who at the time was calling for the creation of an agency to protect consumers from predatory financial practices. She had been trying to get a loan modification for two years but was turned down for the third time two days earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hours after Ms. Chapman met with the president, she was approved for a trial modification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I absolutely believe it was because of the president that I was able to keep my house,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> was formed in 2011. But to Ms. Chapman's chagrin, the Senate has not confirmed its director because Republicans say the agency encroaches on the free market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Incarnato's records storage company, Metropolitan Archives, was one that Mr. Obama said would benefit if the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> could lend more than $2 million to businesses under its 504 loan program. It provides loans to small companies to buy assets for expansion or modernization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Congress approved expanding the lending authority for the 504 program to $5.5 million, Mr. Incarnato is considering an S.B.A. loan to finance the purchase of the rest of the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're fortunate enough that our business is continuing to grow, so we're in a position where we can utilize more space,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She introduced Mr. Obama when he went to her hometown in May 2009 to promote the Credit Card Act, which included a bill of rights for credit card users, and she sat with Michelle Obama at the State of the Union address in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mrs. Lardner appeared with Mr. Obama, the bank reversed the fee and returned her interest rate to 6.5 percent from 21 percent. It had jumped after her daughter's school accidentally charged a tuition payment to her credit card.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her advocacy caught the attention of the White House in October 2009, when she was invited to stand with Mr. Obama as he pressed for solidarity between his administration and health care professionals on the bill's proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though she is excited about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Mangat has seen the political process up close now and knows that the fight is far from over. The next step in Florida is setting up an insurance exchange under a Republican governor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilkes shared his story while introducing Mr. Obama at an event in Grand Junction, Colo., in August 2009. Though struggles with insurance companies have barely subsided since the passage of the health care law, Mr. Wilkes said it had been crucial in the battle for Thomas's health coverage, especially with the elimination of lifetime caps on benefits.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The twisting and twisted tale of the Broadway musical ''Rebecca,'' which fell apart last fall after several investors were revealed to be phantoms, has a new chapter -- and it's a doozy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers for the producers of ''Rebecca'' sued Marc Thibodeau, the show's former publicist, in State Supreme Court on Tuesday for defamation and breach of contract and fiduciary duty, claiming that he scared off an 11th-hour angel investor whose money might have enabled the show to go on. That investor, who made his $2.25 million offer conditional upon total anonymity, pulled out in September after receiving an e-mail from a fictitious ''Sarah Finkelstein'' that recounted the show's troubles and predicted that ''the walls are about to cave in'' on ''Rebecca'' and its lead producer, Ben Sprecher.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for Mr. Thibodeau responded on Tuesday that, yes, Mr. Thibodeau had sent the Finkelstein e-mail to warn ''an innocent investor'' that the show was caught in a ''web of deceit'' after concluding that Mr. Sprecher was in denial about the ''obvious red flags'' facing ''Rebecca.'' Mr. Thibodeau, a veteran theater publicist who has represented ''The Phantom of the Opera'' for its entire 25-year run, is ''an innocent whistle-blower,'' according to his lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several producers said they could not recall a publicist's going behind their backs to one of their investors. Mr. Sprecher's lawyer, Ronald G. Russo, described Mr. Thibodeau's e-mail as ''a profound act of malice and betrayal'' during a phone interview, and said he was still investigating the motive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russo noted that in addition to Mr. Thibodeau, the lawsuit names ''John/Jane Does 1-3'': associates who may have encouraged Mr. Thibodeau to send the e-mail as a way to scuttle ''Rebecca,'' Mr. Russo said. Mr. Thibodeau has several other clients who, conceivably, might have lost some business to ''Rebecca,'' like ''Phantom,'' another gothic romantic musical on Broadway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he was suggesting that ''Phantom'' executives were colluding with Mr. Thibodeau, Mr. Russo said he had no evidence of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Broadway run of ''Rebecca'' was indefinitely postponed in September after a one-two punch: the revelations that a middleman had concocted four investors who were responsible for $4.5 million of the show's $12 million capitalization, followed by a separate fiasco, the departure of the last-minute investor in response to Mr. Thibodeau's e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alleged scheme by the middleman, Mark C. Hotton, who is now facing federal charges, collapsed after a New York Times article questioned the existence of one Hotton investor, ''Paul Abrams,'' who had supposedly died of malaria in London. Mr. Sprecher, the lead producer, for a time defended Mr. Hotton; he now says he was tricked by Mr. Hotton and was only trying to protect his show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sprecher, who came to Mr. Hotton's attention through his well-publicized struggles to raise money for the show, came to rely on Mr. Hotton's promised access to cash, and did not meet or speak with the four investors who turned out not to exist, including Abrams. Mr. Sprecher is now trying to raise several million dollars to open ''Rebecca'' on Broadway later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russo said he identified Mr. Thibodeau after tracking the phony e-mail to him; Mr. Thibodeau had also sent e-mail under the false name ''Bethany Walsh'' to the last-minute investor's lawyers. Mr. Russo tried to get Manhattan prosecutors to bring criminal charges against Mr. Thibodeau, but they did not -- because no crime occurred, according to Mr. Thibodeau's lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Thibodeau's contention that he was only a whistle-blower, Mr. Russo was withering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If he felt like being a whistle-blower, he should have called the authorities or stepped out of the musical, given that he had a fiduciary relationship to the producer Ben Sprecher,'' Mr. Russo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Broadway publicists rose to the defense of Mr. Thibodeau on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Marc Thibodeau is one of the most outstanding press agents in the business,'' wrote Chris Boneau and Adrian Bryan-Brown, two veteran press agents and business partners, in an e-mail.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you ever bought a gift on your friend's wedding registry and wondered, ''Why can't I do this for me, for nonwedding things?'' If you're in the market for a 2013 Dodge Dart, you can, with the Dodge Dart Registry. If that sounds like a crowd-funding exercise, it is, but one for new cars instead of start-ups and hipster rock bands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aimed at young buyers, the Dodge Dart Registry allows potential Dart owners to solicit donations toward the purchase of a new car. That's right, you can get other people to buy the car for you.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting up a registry is simple. First, you create a profile on the registry. Then you customize the 2013 Dodge Dart of your dreams. Next, you wait for the cash to start flowing in like the roaring waters of Niagara Falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your benefactors pick one of 130 possible options, pay for it and leave the rest of the car to other magnanimous people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a registrant named Michael, from Toledo, Ohio, says he needs a car more practical than his beloved Pontiac Trans Am to drive to school and work. So he created a sporty orange Dart online and has solicited $103 to pay for a sliding armrest and a parking brake lever. As of Thursday, he still needed an engine and wheels and the like, but Michael still has 76 days to raise money for the remaining 69 fundable parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are using the registry for charity. The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span> is building an $18,000, slate-gray Dart to donate to the Meals On Wheels West charity. As of Thursday, the fraternity had raised $1,327 over two weeks, but still has a ways to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social media plays heavily into the registry. Dodge is encouraging participants to connect their registry profiles to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has two purposes: It helps would-be Dart owners attract donations, and it helps Dodge turn the Dart into a social media presence and, the brand hopes, a cultural phenomenon of sorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the young buyer's perspective, the effectiveness of appealing to many people for car-buying money remains unclear. The registry may relieve some of the pressure on parents inured to the traditional single-source approach to automotive funding, but will a departure from focused begging leave these automotive dreamers without wheels?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Automobile Film Club of America has played a supporting role in New York-based film and television productions since 1993. It owns a fleet of vehicles -- including police cruisers, taxis and vintage automobiles -- that have squired stars and models in advertising shoots, TV shows and action films, including two Spider-Man movies and two ''Men in Black'' films. Woody Allen rented a 1964 Porsche Cabriolet for one movie and bought an Aston Martin that was totaled in another. ''When they crash something, they buy it,'' said Ralph Lucci, the owner.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CHALLENGE Deciding whether Mr. Lucci, 60, should put his house up as collateral to get a <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> loan in an attempt to revive his business, which is based in Stapleton, on Staten Island, half a block from the waterfront. In October, Hurricane Sandy's surge swamped the company's 6,000-square-foot lot and garage, submerging 57 cars in salt water. (Three vehicles that were on garage lifts avoided damage.) Lost were an ambulance worth $20,000, taxi cabs that cost more than $5,000 and a police crime scene unit vehicle valued at more than $16,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have mechanics, they all say they're totally junk,'' Mr. Lucci said. ''It took five hours to destroy the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the storm, he spent weeks trying to start cars and ripping out rotting plaster board from his office. The $25,000 tow truck turns over but keeps slipping out of gear. He figures it will cost $400,000 to replace the cars and refurbish the office, the shop and the equipment. Unfortunately, the cars were insured only for liability -- adequate, he thought, for transporting cars from Point A to Point B. (Once they are on a movie set, his vehicles are insured by the production.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE BACKGROUND Mr. Lucci began supplying cars to the movie industry in 1975. Lucci Auto Props, a business he owned with his brother, was based in Red Hook, Brooklyn. After the two had a falling out, Mr. Lucci said, he walked away from the company and opened a shop that sold exotic cars. In the late '80s, he took a sales job with a luxury carmaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he never lost interest in the movie business. In 1993, he opened Automobile Film Club, using a lot from the city's Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Lucci said he worked hard to get production companies the exact vehicles they wanted and stayed on set to make sure everything worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, his business grew to 350 cars and 14 full-time employees, mostly secretaries and mechanics. The company survived the long drought after 9/11, when the mayor's office stopped issuing film permits. Mr. Lucci said a $45,000 S.B.A. loan helped him get by and has been paid back. In 2008, his best year, the business grossed $1.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next year, his contract for the lot ended. Unable to find a large, affordable parcel for his fleet, Mr. Lucci downsized, buying one 10,000-square-foot lot and renting another. He sold hundreds of cars. The payroll dwindled to him and his wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Hurricane Irene in 2011, Mr. Lucci said, 30 of his cars were damaged. Because he was carrying only liability insurance on his vehicles, he could not claim damages. The S.B.A. offered him a $6,000 loan at 4 percent interest. He thought the amount was too small, so he turned it down. The following year, he said, was a struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Hurricane Sandy hit, Mr. Lucci's vehicles were still insured for liability only. His office and garage were insured, as was $30,000 in equipment. But, like many business owners, he carried no protection against floodwaters or business interruption. After the storm, Mr. Lucci said, he received $5,800 for wind damage and nothing for what was destroyed by water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OPTIONS Mr. Lucci has concluded he has two options. He can close the business for good, or he can borrow a lot of money and try to make another go of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City has been offering emergency loans to small businesses of up to $25,000, interest-free for the first six months and 1 percent interest for the 24 months after that. The city approved Mr. Lucci for such a loan, but he said it would barely make a dent. ''I couldn't even fix my office,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A local office of the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> has urged him to apply for a fixed-rate disaster loan. The agency has said businesses can obtain as much as $2 million at 4 percent interest for up to 30 years. One drawback? The S.B.A. told him he would be required to have flood insurance, and Mr. Lucci fears that could cost him up to $25,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Mr. Lucci said he would have to put up the home he shares with his wife as collateral. He turns 61 in May. ''I don't know how I'm going to pay it back,'' he said. ''I'll finish paying when I'm 90. I might not be here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He knows that some businesses that get disaster loans end up defaulting -- according to the S.B.A., the government wrote off $153 million, or nearly 2.5 percent, of the $6 billion in loans made after Hurricane Katrina. If the Automobile Film Club is one of those businesses that never rebounds, he knows he could lose everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to leave something to my family,'' he said. ''What if I lose my house if something doesn't go good?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT OTHERS SAY Kevin Langley, co-founder of Ellis Construction, in New Orleans, whose business was devastated by Hurricane Katrina: ''Use the $25,000 New York City emergency loan and the S.B.A. loan to purchase assets that can generate revenues. Consider working out of your house or a temporary office until you are able to rebuild the office with cash flows. Consider the salvage value of the existing damaged fleet and sell off any vehicles and assets that will not generate revenue or that aren't critical to the operation to generate cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Mathewson, president of Home Comfort Warehouse in White River Junction, Vt., took an S.B.A. loan to rebuild his alternative heating company after it was flooded in 2012: ''I think Mr. Lucci, at age 60, has to ask himself what does he want to be doing in five years. If he wants to retire, he should determine if his business will be sellable in five years and if the projected value is at least what his S.B.A. loan balance will be. He shouldn't take out a large loan, putting his home up for security only to find out the business is worth less than the loan. If that's the case, he might be better off shutting down now and going to work for someone else. I don't think he should spend three years losing money while he rebuilds the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rohit Arora, co-founder of Biz2Credit, which arranges small-business loans: "If he liquidates the business, what sort of work could he do? It would likely be very difficult for him to find a decent paying job at his age. In rebuilding his company, he knows what he is getting into. One thing he should not do is open again in a flooded area. After being hit twice, why open again in Staten Island when he can set up operations elsewhere in New York City?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on the You're the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and on this page, we will give an update on what Mr. Lucci is planning to do.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Will Fuentes planned an extended business trip to Seattle last year, he tapped into the local chapter of a national networking group there. Within hours, Mr. Fuentes, who founded the Arlington, Va., software company Lemur Retail, had secured a work space, introductions and even restaurant recommendations via the group, the Startup America Partnership."Before I flew out there, I already had five or six meetings set up with potential clients and other key contacts, as well as one potential acquirer," Mr. Fuentes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, entrepreneurs would have needed several trips to make similar connections outside their own cities. Even in this era of social networks and venture conferences, start-ups are still surprisingly disconnected on a national level.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Each region has its ties, but in many cases, entrepreneurs are operating in silos," said Carolynn Duncan, the chief executive of Portland Ten, a mentoring program for early-stage companies, mainly in Oregon. "An entrepreneur in Oregon doesn't have an easy way to network with entrepreneurs in Washington D.C."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Startup America, a nonprofit organization with an all-star cast of deep-pocketed backers, is trying to bridge the gap. The organization, which was started in January 2011 as the brainchild of AOL's co-founder, Steve Case, and the <span class="companylink">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</span>, wanted to bring a private-sector support to start-ups - without financial strings attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Supporting start-ups throughout the country is the only way to make sure the American economy is firing on all cylinders," said Mr. Case, who is the chairman of the partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-ups are a crucial driver for job creation in the United States. From March 1994 to March 2010, businesses less than one year old created 3.9 million jobs a year on average, according to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, though that number has declined during the recent economic weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> and United States Chamber of Commerce have long been a resource for start-ups, but these government agencies have a broad mandate. There is a "growing recognition," said Mr. Case, that high-growth start-ups - those with the potential to be national or international companies - have different needs and requirements than traditional small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Startup America's initial focus was to provide support to start-ups through deals on goods and services, like 40 percent off <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> shipping and free flights on American Airlines. But the group quickly realized that start-ups needed more practical help, like sharing best practices and networking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the partnership's start, entrepreneurs around the country starting contacting Startup America, asking how they could create their own networks and reach out to counterparts in other states. "Most of these regions were already coming up with their own initiatives or thinking about them," said the organization's chief executive, Scott Case, a founder and former chief technology officer of Priceline.com (and no relation to Steve Case). "We're helping to stitch together all these parts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking cues from the entrepreneurs, Startup America has turned its attention to building such a network. Nearly 12,000 members are now affiliated with local Startup America initiatives in 30 states. The partnership expects to add another 10 states this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each Startup America region is spearheaded by local "champions" who come together several times a year at national conferences, communicate via <span class="companylink">Google</span> groups and have access to an online "idea center" where they can brainstorm about, say, bringing in outside capital or hosting a start-up conference. These envoys are all "founder types" at different stages of their careers, Scott Case said. "Some have exited companies and are looking to continue to feed that creative drive. Others understand that if they can strengthen their community, they can strengthen their own company."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooks Bell, founder of an eponymous 22-employee digital consulting business based in Raleigh, N.C., became involved with the partnership in 2011 after realizing that many potential clients considered her area a backwater. "I realized that was impacting my company's brand, too," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Bell pointed out that other national groups, like Entrepreneurs' Organizations, offer resources for high-growth companies. Yet, their emphasis is typically on supporting individuals rather than elevating the region and networking nationally. "They also tend to focus on early-stage companies," she said. Until Startup America, she added, "there weren't a lot of opportunities for early-stage companies to interact with funded companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Startup America regions work off the same blueprint, each takes a slightly different approach. In Maryland, the staff and champions volunteer virtually. Startup Tennessee partnered with the Entrepreneur Center in Nashville, which runs a nonprofit incubator program. Startup Colorado works out of Silicon Flatirons, a center for law, technology and entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado Law School, and finds partners to finance specific projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the regional chapters operate independently, they benefit from the credibility of a national organization. "It's helping elevate our start-ups nationally and get them in front of audiences we never would have," said Andy Stoll, an entrepreneur in the Iowa City, Iowa, area, where rebuilding from the floods in 2008 has helped generate a boom in start-up activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To have the opportunity to sit in a room with their board and have Steve Case ask me, 'What are the three things that those of us at this table can do to really help support the Indiana community?' is amazing and a humbling experience," said Michael Coffey, a partner at DeveloperTown, an Indianapolis design and development firm that works with companies of all sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, it's all about business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Schwartz, a co-founder of the San Francisco-based Modify Watches, initially joined Startup America for the discounts. Now, he's also tapping into the partnership to network, including finding corporate clients who order custom watches and vendors. "I now have a contact in Tennessee who has offered to look into manufacturing our watches there," he said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fuentes of Lemur Retail found two potential clients, both national chains, through his connections in Seattle last year; he's currently in talks with those companies. He's also helping his Northwest counterparts make inroads in the Washington area. He likens the experience to a fraternity or alumni organization of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When people contact me from my high school or college, I pick up the phone," he said. "This is no different."</p>

And if they still have to pay more to the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>, it may not be their only extra expense, tax specialists warn. The cost -- in time, money and worry -- of preparing returns, tweaking payroll systems and complying with regulations will rise, too, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were some big changes as we moved into the new year,'' said Kate Barton, the Americas vice chairwoman for tax services at <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>. ''We moved from the fiscal cliff to a fiscal minefield.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners may already be placing themselves on the casualty list. Eighty percent of the ones responding to a Gallup poll last month said that the tax situation was hurting them a little or a lot, versus 2 percent who said it was helping. In the health care realm, the spread of opinion was similar, at 73 percent to 2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners had to start docking their employees' pay, and their own, by an extra two percentage points on Jan. 1, when a two-year reduction in the payroll tax expired. They might also have had to increase withholding or estimated-tax payments to adjust for higher income and Medicare tax rates that went into effect that day for high earners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax rates on dividends also increased for those with high incomes. That could affect owners of businesses set up as C corporations, who often extract money from their companies as dividends instead of salary, Ms. Barton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher rate on dividends could make a C corporation less tax efficient than a sole proprietorship or an entity like a partnership or a subchapter S corporation, in which income ultimately accrues to the owners as individuals. She noted, though, that this is just one of several considerations when deciding which structure is best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It might be better to have a lower corporate rate than a higher individual rate,'' but with the changes made on Jan. 1, ''the difference in rates could be only four percentage points,'' she said. ''You really need to think it through because there's more flexibility with a partnership or some other flow-through entity. You've got to run the numbers to see what's best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several deductions and credits coveted by small businesses have been renewed, expanded or reinstated retroactively, said Carl J. Giardino, managing director of the tax group at the CBIZ MHM consulting firm. The amount of the Section 179 deduction, which allows expenditures on capital items like factory equipment to be written off immediately rather than depreciated gradually, has been raised to $500,000 from $125,000. The increase applies to 2012 and 2013 alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonus depreciation, which allows capital equipment to be written off at a faster rate beyond what the Section 179 deduction allows, has been extended and applies to the first $2 million spent, he said. Unlike the situation with the deduction, only new equipment -- not used -- qualifies for accelerated depreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two credits that expired in 2011 or were sharply curtailed, the Research Tax Credit and the Work Opportunities Tax Credit, have been brought back and made retroactive to 2012, Mr. Giardino said. The first credit is for 20 percent of research expenditure that exceeds a baseline amount or 14 percent using a different formulation. The second is for 40 percent of varying portions of wages for new employees in certain fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Work Opportunities credit, which covers military veterans, workers coming off government assistance, and ex-felons, is useful for ''almost any type of Main Street business,'' he said. ''If I hire 10 people and can put $25,000 to $40,000 back in my pocket, that's significant'' to a small business. ''A lot of companies in the restaurant field were taking advantage of this. It really helped them stay afloat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was until the credit was eliminated for all categories of workers except veterans last year, before the reinstatement. While he acknowledges the value of this and other credits to small businesses, Mr. Giardino finds the on-again, off-again situation unhelpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We keep doing Band-Aids, extending credits a year or two,'' he said. ''We need some permanency with these provisions for them to become meaningful so that businesses can plan accordingly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some intense planning could be in order as the Jan. 1, 2014, deadline approaches for important requirements of the Affordable Care Act. It could cost employers dearly if they fail to meet certain conditions, warned J. D. Piro, head of the legal group of the health and benefits practice at the <span class="companylink">Aon</span> Hewitt consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A business with 50 or more employees who each work at least 30 hours a week must offer them health insurance that meets certain criteria. If it does not and if any employees get subsidized coverage at a government insurance exchange, Mr. Piro said, the business is subject to hefty fines. The calculation is tedious, but it works out to a fine of $2,000, times the size of the total work force -- not just the employees who obtain an exchange subsidy -- minus $60,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses also face a penalty when the premium for the employer's plan exceeds 9.5 percent of an employee's wages and the employee decides to take an exchange subsidy. This penalty is $3,000, but is assessed based on the number of employees who get the subsidy, not the entire staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if companies manage to escape the penalties, Mr. Piro said, headaches may be unavoidable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are going to have to conduct tests to make sure their coverage is affordable and to make sure they've offered it to full-time employees,'' he said. ''There's a lot of work involved to make sure they meet these rules.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barton at <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> agreed. ''A lot of companies of all sizes are grappling with it and are very ill prepared,'' she said. ''I'm really worried about small companies. They should do a feasibility analysis to see if their existing benefit plan is adequate and their employees are educated.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mills became increasingly visible as a messenger of the Obama administration, which has been eager to present itself as relentlessly pursuing an entrepreneurial agenda. She helped lead the administration's Startup America program, which seeks to foster entrepreneurship through initiatives by the government and commitments from business leaders and private institutions. In January 2012, President Obama elevated the position of the agency's administrator to his cabinet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement from the White House, Mr. Obama thanked Ms. Mills for her service. "I asked Karen to lead the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> because I knew she had the skills and experience to help America's small businesses recover from the worst economic crisis in generations - and that's exactly what she's done," he said. "Because of Karen's hard work and dedication, our small businesses are better positioned to create jobs and our entire economy is stronger."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administrator, in turn, praised her staff. "Four years ago, when I arrived at the S.B.A., America's small businesses and entrepreneurs were struggling in the face of the worst economic environment since the Great Depression - and a banking sector that was frozen," Ms. Mills wrote in a memo. "Together, we rolled up our sleeves and went to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She will remain at the agency's helm until the Senate confirms her successor. A White House spokesman would not say when President Obama would name the new candidate.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recovery so far, small businesses have largely been left behind. Initially, loans were hard to come by and consumers weren't shopping. Now, small-business owners say, Washington is throwing up additional roadblocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In survey after survey, owners of small businesses report unbridled pessimism about the economy. The small-business optimism index from the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> -- a major industry group for small businesses that surveys a sample of its members each month -- is stuck at recessionary levels. In January's report, released this week, expectations for business conditions six months from now were at their fourth-lowest reading in nearly 40 years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparable measures for large companies have exceeded their prerecession levels. That is partly because big companies have a larger global footprint, so they are benefiting from strong growth in places like China and India. Small businesses are more closely tied to the leaden domestic economy, said Paul Ballew, chief analytic and data officer at <span class="companylink">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</span>, so weak growth at home is weighing more heavily on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gulf in optimism between small and large companies seems to widen, though, during occasions of greater policy uncertainty and Washington gridlock -- including the present. And while small businesses always grumble about taxes and regulation, they are especially likely to do so now. Asked by the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> about their ''single most important problem,'' small-business owners are now as likely to name taxes or government requirements as they are to name sales, which had reigned supreme from September 2008 until mid-2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Politicians are uniformly quick to offer paeans to small businesses, but their actions have directly held back the sector, to the huge detriment of the economy,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. ''The timing of this latest slump is particularly frustrating because the key precondition for a real small-business recovery -- the normalization of bank lending to commercial and industrial companies -- is within reach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear why policy and economic uncertainty would be taking a greater toll on small versus large businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller companies might have be more alarmed by headlines about the debt ceiling and fiscal tightening because they don't have armies of in-house analysts to advise them about relative risks, said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford who maintains an index on policy uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller businesses are also more fixated on domestic uncertainty because they are less diversified than big firms -- both geographically and in terms of product lines -- and so have smaller margins for error. The last several years have offered multiple false starts in the domestic economy (remember ''Recovery Summer'' in 2010?), and small businesses that acted on any sense of optimism often found themselves badly burned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ralph Jensen, president of Pro Data IV, a nine-person accounting and bookkeeping firm in Green Bay, Wis., has watched and learned. He would like to open another office in Appleton, about 30 miles south, and hire a new employee. But he is concerned about how another blowup in Washington, or at the very least lingering uncertainty about tax increases and spending cuts, might affect his clients' expansion plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike a big company that can take a tax write-off for investing in space or equipment it ends up not needing, ''I just don't have much wiggle room if I fail,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before he would feel comfortable expanding, he said, ''I'd have to see my business is growing consistently for a long time, and I would have to have really, really strong faith in the fact that people were going to be opening more businesses around here that would be looking for services like mine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what fiscal showdown Washington might have in the coming weeks, recent Congressional decisions have already had concrete effects on the economic security of small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many business owners report continued confusion about what their health care liabilities will be in 2014, for example, when some employers will be required to offer health insurance and other changes to health benefits kick in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners who sell directly to consumers say they are also concerned about the effects that Congress's recent tax increases, like the end of the payroll tax holiday, will have on their bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know I'm in kind of a unique situation in that I don't sell anything that anybody needs, the way you need groceries or some other things,'' said Jason Starkey, the owner of Starkey Products, in Orange City, Fla., which sells lighting products and other accessories that are installed in new cars. ''I know I've noticed the tax hike that just occurred, so people making $50,000 to $60,000, the people who buy our products, must be noticing it, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest commercial and industrial lending numbers from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> suggest that the credit market for small businesses is healing. Rising housing values, too, are good for small-business borrowers, who often take out personal loans to finance their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many small businesses are still struggling to have their credit needs met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The banks are not lending. They claim they are, but they're not,'' said Summit Kumar, president of Summit Telecom, a telecommunications company in Hicksville, N.Y. ''I got a line of credit from a bank five years ago and I paid it back. Now the same bank says I'm 'high-risk business' and turns me away.'' He acknowledges that his business has taken a hit in recent years and that he has had to lay off employees, but he says that his inability to get credit is part of the problem. He says he has had to resort to cash advance companies that expect him to pay back loans at exorbitant interest rates. One alternative lender said it would give him $50,000 if he paid it back with $75,000 six months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggles of small businesses ripple through the rest of the economy. They are reluctant to invest in expensive capital equipment, for one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Starkey said that eight or nine years ago he could have justified investing in a $25,000 piece of equipment that would help him make a particular piece for a Ford Mustang, since he knew he would be able to earn back his investment in six months. But today, he doesn't know if he will be able to get a return in six months or two years, and ''having that kind of money tied up in one item is just too great a risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metrics of small-business hiring and hiring intentions are also very low, according to the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> and the Labor Department. That might partly explain why so many middle-age women have dropped out of the labor force in recent years, said Mr. Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisers, since women are more likely to be employed at smaller service sector companies than, say, manufacturers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until the small-business sector starts to feel better,'' he said, ''the rest of the economy isn't going to feel much better either.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLEVELAND -- As Christopher Holbert danced down the aisle of a Cleveland Correctional Center classroom, dozens of other prisoners in matching dark blue uniforms flanked him, clapping and cheering. When he reached the front of the classroom, he spoke for 10 minutes on his business plan for Adrenaline Indoor Paintball, an idea he worked on over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three investors lined up, he plans to create the company when he returns to the Dallas area. But first he has to finish his three-year sentence for arson.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I used to be complacent,'' Mr. Holbert said. ''Without prison, I would have never known how to start my own business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holbert, 39, is one of more than 100 students in the Prison Entrepreneurship Program, an initiative organized by a Houston nonprofit of the same name that teaches business skills to prisoners who will soon be released, including market research, finance and professional etiquette. Inmates across the state can apply, and those accepted are transferred to the Cleveland Correctional Center, which houses the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the program created a partnership with the Hankamer School of Business at <span class="companylink">Baylor University</span> to offer each inmate who completes the program a certificate in entrepreneurship. Although the course of study is not changing, say organizers, the partnership adds credibility and an extra incentive for the men to excel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Carini, associate dean of the graduate program in management and entrepreneurship at Hankamer, serves on the governing board for the entrepreneurship program. He was so impressed with the curriculum that he persuaded the university to give the certificates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 5,000 inmates apply each year, and 120 are selected for the program. ''We ask, 'Is the man genuinely committed to change?' '' said Bert Smith, the program's chief executive. ''The second is, 'Do we believe based on everything he's done before, he's got a strong work ethic?' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three months of classes in character development and computer skills, the prisoners form business plans during six months of entrepreneurship classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students in the program, which started in 2004, currently make up two-thirds of the prison unit's population. Program officials say they raise up to $2 million a year from private foundations and individuals, and they estimate that the program saves the state roughly $6 million in reduced recidivism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it would not work for everyone in prison. ''Part of it is probably that inmates who are interested are those already committed to changing their lives,'' said Marc Levin, a criminal justice researcher with the <span class="companylink">Texas Public Policy Foundation</span>, a conservative research organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership has drawn praise from many Texas business leaders who say that criminal justice reform can benefit the economy, as successful former inmates become employees, consumers and taxpayers. ''Studies have shown that vocational education reduces recidivism more than anything else you can do,'' Mr. Levin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prisoners are delving into various fields. Shawn Evans, two years into his four-year sentence for driving while intoxicated, plans a Web site where people can design custom blankets for babies. Others want to sell vending machines with healthy products and work as party entertainers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program also operates transitional houses in Dallas and Houston that most of the graduates live in for two to three months after release. Jeremy Gregg, chief development officer for the program, said that the biggest challenge was to keep the program's graduates accountable once they were released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the inmates were asked how they plan to deal with questions from future customers about their pasts, many of them said they hoped honesty would trump the stigma of having been in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'll get their confidence by telling the truth,'' said Ricardo Blanco, who is serving a 13-year sentence for manslaughter and kidnapping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the end of his speech about paintball, Mr. Holbert stumbled, forgetting the next part of his speech. The crowd, which had been totally silent, encouraged him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can do it!'' someone shouted repeatedly, slowly overtaken by the cheers of the rest, until Mr. Holbert broke into a smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's up to you,'' Mr. Smith said, ''but you're not alone.''</p>

Quinn in the New York City mayor's race if Ms. Quinn, speaker of the City Council, did not allow a vote on sick-leave legislation that is a cherished cause of liberal groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure, which would require many small businesses to provide at least five sick days a year to employees, has been blocked by Ms. Quinn, who has said the rules would be hurtful in a fragile economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her inaction has complicated her efforts to secure support from liberal groups as she pursues the Democratic nomination for mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring the depth of the disappointment with Ms. Quinn among some left-leaning activists, Ms. Steinem said in a statement that she viewed passage of the sick-leave legislation as more significant than electing the first female mayor of New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Making life fairer for all women seems more important than breaking a barrier for one woman,'' Ms. Steinem said, adding that the bill would ensure that working mothers could better take care of sick children without fear of losing their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Ms. Quinn released a statement saying that the sick-day measure was ''a worthy and admirable goal, one I would like to make available for all.'' She said she would continue to ''discuss the legislation, in the context of the evolving economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Steinem, who once introduced Ms. Quinn at a fund-raiser, has urged the speaker for months to allow a vote on the bill. Her statement was provided to The New York Times this week by the <span class="companylink">Working Families Party</span>, which is leading a campaign in favor of the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party hopes the pressure of an election year can help sway Ms. Quinn on the measure, which is supported by several of her rivals in the Democratic primary contest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation faces stiff opposition from business groups, whose support Ms. Quinn has assiduously courted. An invitation sent on Wednesday by a host of a coming fund-raiser for Ms. Quinn portrayed her as a friend of the city's real estate industry, lauding her support of an expansion of Chelsea Market and her opposition to property tax increases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its Web site, <span class="companylink">Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs</span> on Thursday published the names and addresses of accused tax cheats, along with the amount the department says they owe. The individuals and small businesses owe a combined £1.8 million, or $2.7 million, in fines and unpaid taxes. The department said the list would be updated every three months.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is intended to encourage Britons to pay their taxes in full and put pressure on tax dodgers to come forward, the government said, but some lawmakers and pressure groups argued that it failed to address the real problem in Britain: tax avoidance strategies used by large corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The publication of these names sends a clear signal that cheating on tax is wrong and reassures people who pay their taxes -- the vast majority -- that there are consequences for those who refuse to tell <span class="companylink">Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs</span> about their full liability,'' David Gauke, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives of <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, Amazon and <span class="companylink">Google</span> were questioned by lawmakers in November over concerns that the companies were not paying enough tax in Britain, given the sales they generate here. The companies responded that they had been unfairly singled out, but a month later <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> bowed to public pressure and said it would pay more corporate tax in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going after tax cheats and making it harder for individuals and companies to find loopholes in the tax system is one of Prime Minister David Cameron's top goals. At a time of austerity -- and when average households are increasingly squeezed by rising electricity and food prices -- the government is under pressure to be seen as doing more to limit tax evasion and avoidance. In January, Mr. Cameron said those avoiding taxes ''need to wake up and smell the coffee.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain missed out on £5 billion in revenue in the tax year that ended in 2011 because of tax-avoidance methods and about £4 billion from tax evasion, according to the tax authorities. The Public Accounts Committee, a group of lawmakers representing the largest political parties, called on the authorities Tuesday to consider naming and shaming those who promote tax avoidance strategies to make them less attractive to individuals and companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nine names published on the Web site also include a wine merchant, a grocery store and a bus operator. UK Uncut, a campaign that combats tax avoidance, said the step showed the authorities ''spent time and money going after small companies that avoid tax, but so far we've seen no serious action from the government to claw back the billions avoided by global giants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Morgan, head of tax policy at KPMG in London, said the naming and shaming campaign was a ''perfectly reasonable step'' and would help to deter people from not declaring their full income. The tax bills of large corporations are a different matter because companies generally declare their income properly, he said, but their tax obligations can be interpreted in different ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judith Freedman, a professor of taxation law at <span class="companylink">Oxford University</span>, agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people who have been named on the Web site deliberately evaded taxes'' and were penalized for it, she said, adding that there was ''no penalty you could levy against the big companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far, no one has proven that they have done something wrong,'' she said. ''You might not like what they do, but it is no secret.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- As the United States prepares for mandatory budget cuts on Friday, Hong Kong is grappling with a very different problem: spending money as fast as it sluices into government coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory, presented on Wednesday a budget that calls for a long list of one-time subsidies, particularly for the poor and aging. He also said the government would waive business registration fees and reduce the profits tax, particularly for small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stimulus measures come after heavy criticism in Hong Kong that the government consistently produces large budget surpluses even during periods of weak economic growth, including the last year. The Hong Kong economy grew only 1.4 percent last year, well below its average of 4.5 percent over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong consistently runs budget surpluses mainly because it has low social spending and no military. By comparison, the federal government in the United States dedicates roughly half its spending to assisting the aging -- through Social Security, Medicare and the nursing home portion of Medicaid -- and directs another quarter of spending to the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hong Kong government is now sharply increasing social spending in percentage terms but from such a low base that spending still falls short of revenue. After years of accumulated surpluses, the city is sitting on cash accumulated from previous surpluses equal to 23 months' total spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the heaviest criticism of previous budgets has come from advocates speaking on behalf of what are known locally as the ''multiple have-nots.'' These are low-income residents, often young, who have not been on the waiting list long enough to qualify for public rental housing, so they do not qualify for a two-month rent waiver that Mr. Tsang announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are not older citizens, so they do not qualify for the extra month of old-age allowance payments that Mr. Tsang also announced, nor are they destitute enough to qualify for the extra month of welfare payment that was announced. And they live in shared apartments where they may not benefit directly from the government's $230 subsidy in the coming fiscal year for each residential electricity bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help them, Mr. Tsang announced that the government would give an extra $1.9 billion to the government-controlled Community Care Fund, which does social work like rent assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have every confidence that we will be able to assist more people in need, particularly that group of people who used to complain that they were being left out from the budget relief measures -- the so-called multiple have-nots,'' Carrie Lam, the territory's chief secretary, said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcellus Wong, a senior adviser in the Hong Kong office of <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, a global professional services firm, noted that Mr. Tsang's figures showed that government expenditures have risen twice as fast as economic output over the last 15 years, and expenditures are creeping above one-fifth of output. ''The government needs to closely monitor this benchmark,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hong Kong government uses conservative budget forecasts, consistently predicting small deficits that turn into large surpluses. The government predicted a year ago that it would run a deficit of $449 million for the fiscal year through the end of March, but its most recent estimate is that it will now run a surplus of $8.3 billion instead, and Mr. Wong predicted that the final figure would be a surplus of more than $9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the coming fiscal year, Mr. Tsang again predicted a deficit of $628 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Social spending has stayed low until now partly because Hong Kong has a single-payer government health care system with low pay for doctors and nurses by American standards, and with supplemental charges and waiting lists for expensive medical procedures. But recurrent social spending is on track to rise 33 percent in the coming year, mainly because the government is introducing a monthly payment of $282 to all low-income residents 65 and older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong has also begun gradually building a mandatory retirement savings system based on bank-managed mutual funds. But many of the current older citizens retired before it was started and do not benefit. Many current workers have had extremely low returns on their savings because of annual fees of 2 percent of assets or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families have tended to look after aging members, further limiting social spending for the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In western Hong Kong island, an area with a large population of older residents, four elderly people on the street each said in interviews on Wednesday that they did not expect much money from the government because they lived with their children, who supported them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fifth resident, Wu Jinyao, a retired construction worker who is recovering from oral cancer, did complain that the government was too frugal in only promising an extra month's payment of disability allowances in the coming fiscal year starting on April 1. He said he had high medicine and transportation costs to go to a distant government hospital for continued chemotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have been to the various government agencies and they tell me to come back when I am down to my last 500 Hong Kong dollars,'' or about $64, he said. ''What system is this?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration says it will require health insurance companies to report all price increases, no matter how small, to the federal government so officials can monitor the impact of the new health care law and insurers' compliance with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under current rules, the federal government requires insurers to report information on rate increases of 10 percent or more. New rules being issued by the administration will extend this requirement to all rate increases for all health plans sold to individuals, families and small businesses -- a total of 60 million people.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal health officials said they needed the additional data to monitor trends in premiums as major provisions of the law take effect and more people buy insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The purpose of this policy is to identify patterns that could indicate market disruption, which could occur given the additional standards that apply'' to insurance starting next year, the administration said in a justification of the rules adopted by Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new law, Ms. Sebelius said, she is supposed to ''monitor premium increases of health insurance coverage'' inside and outside the regulated state-level markets known as insurance exchanges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer advocates welcomed the new reporting requirements, saying they would enhance the ability of insurance regulators and the public to scrutinize rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers object to the requirements. The federal government ''is creating a hugely burdensome and expensive reporting system'' that duplicates what most states already require, the <span class="companylink">Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporting requirements generally apply to rate increases sought after the beginning of next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fierce debate has erupted over the impact of Mr. Obama's health care law. Insurers and employers predict that it will drive up premiums, especially for healthy people under the age of 35. The White House disputes that prediction and says that many factors will lead to lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law guarantees coverage for people regardless of pre-existing conditions, prohibits insurers from charging women more, and limits their ability to charge higher rates to older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers now often divide consumers into groups. Premiums are often higher and rise faster for less healthy individuals and groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the new law requires insurers to pool the claim costs of all their customers when setting rates in the individual market in a state. Likewise, insurers must consider the claims histories of all their small-business customers when setting rates for them. Premiums for each product are supposed to reflect the combined experience of all products in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal health officials said they needed to know the prices of all insurance products so they could determine whether insurers were complying with these requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If an insurer wants to increase rates for any product, it ''must submit a rate filing justification for all products'' in the same market, the rule says. ''Products can no longer be reviewed as completely unique,'' but must reflect the experience of the entire market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia T. Philips, a health actuary who works for the Minnesota insurance commissioner, called this one of the law's most important consumer protections. Minnesota has had a similar requirement for 20 years, she said, and consumers have benefited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers say that policies sold under the new federal law will be more comprehensive and more expensive than what many people have now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House says the fears of ''rate shock'' are overblown. Consumers can move from expensive health plans to more efficient, lower-cost plans, the administration says. It says critics who focus on premiums do not take account of other provisions of the law that limit how much consumers will spend out of their own pockets for health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the administration predicts that people gaining insurance will, on average, be younger and healthier than those who already have it, and this would tend to hold down premiums. Finally, it says, even if premiums increase significantly, lower-income people will be able to get federal subsidies to help defray the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmen L. Balber, the director of the Washington office of Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit advocacy group, said: ''We applaud the administration for the new reporting requirements. This is a huge step forward.'' But she added: ''There's a loophole. In 10 to 15 states, insurance commissioners have no power to reject unreasonable rate increases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said she would introduce a bill to provide the secretary of health and human services with power to deny or modify rate increases found to be excessive or unjustified.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SLAPPING a catchy acronym like the JOBS Act on a piece of legislation makes it more difficult for politicians to oppose it -- and indeed that's what happened with the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unveiled a year ago by House Republican leaders, the proposal was rushed into law with large majorities just two months later; its provisions are gradually taking effect.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its enticing acronym notwithstanding, the JOBS Act has little to do with employment; it's a hodgepodge of provisions that together constitute the greatest loosening of securities regulation in modern history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most troublesome is the legalization of ''crowd funding,'' the ability of start-up companies to raise capital from small investors on the Internet. While such lightly regulated capital raising has existed for years, until now, ''investors'' could receive only trinkets and other items of small value, similar to the way public television raises funds. As soon as regulations required to implement the new rules are completed, people who invest money in start-ups through sites similar to Kickstarter will be able to receive a financial interest in the soliciting company, much like buying shares on the stock exchange. But the enterprises soliciting these funds will hardly be big corporations like <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> or Exxon; they will be small start-ups with no track records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picking winners among the many young companies seeking money is a tough business, even for the most sophisticated investors. Indeed, most professionally run venture funds lose money. For individuals, it's pure folly. Buy a lottery ticket instead. Your chance of winning is likely to be higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters say the amounts that can be lost will be limited. But an American earning $40,000 can still risk $2,000 per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other major provisions of the JOBS Act are less terrifying but still problematic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, private equity and hedge funds will be able to advertise -- and thereby separate inexpert individuals from their savings. Putting money in these alternatives is yet another type of investing that Americans shouldn't try at home. Until now, only a small percentage of Americans who qualified to invest this way (the law requires they have an income of $200,000 per year for an individual or a net worth of $1 million) did so. The possibility that advertising will lure more people to participate does no one any favors. Besides, these days, the most successful private equity and hedge funds can already raise all the capital they can efficiently manage without advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I'll wager that most of this new advertising will come from firms that sophisticated institutional investors wouldn't consider investing in. No wonder that the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, whose former chairwoman Mary Schapiro opposed the legislation, has been taking its time writing the regulations to implement these provisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the least, the S.E.C. should insist on standardized disclosure for these funds, particularly of performance and fees, similar to what is required of mutual funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already in effect is the section of the act that makes it easier for small companies (defined as less than $1 billion in annual revenues) to go public. For example, these companies no longer have to file as much financial information as their larger brethren. By some estimates, that could have benefited as many as 90 percent of recent I.P.O.'s, including such prominent names as LinkedIn, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> and <span class="companylink">Pandora Media</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, companies as diverse as the Manchester United soccer team (founded in 1878) and dodgy Chinese businesses have taken advantage of the provisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the Sarbanes-Oxley securities regulation law, passed in the wake of the dot-com meltdown and the Enron fraud, has overly burdened public companies and deterred initial public offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the JOBS Act's update for ''emerging growth companies'' goes too far, particularly in relaxing the prohibition on research analysts to recommend stocks while their firms are underwriting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although 25 Democratic senators and one independent, Bernie Sanders, opposed the legislation, it had broad support from business groups and from some research organizations like the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span>. The Obama administration signed on, convinced that the need to encourage start-up capital was great and that the legislation's shortcomings could be fixed during the implementation phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest number of jobs likely to be created by the JOBS Act will be for lawyers needed to clean up the mess that it will create.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEY'RE called entrepreneurship or small-business certificates, and they don't carry the cachet or the credit of an M.B.A. But they take far less time to obtain, and they cost less, too. More colleges are offering them as a way to help people get their businesses off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classes cover topics like marketing and advertising, financial management, tax and legal issues, business plans, pricing, fund-raising and customer service. Beyond the basics, programs can offer electives covering a specific business or skill, like selling over the Internet. Programs can be tailored to the needs of the surrounding community, and the faculty can be businessmen and women in the area. Teachers have the potential to provide mentoring in addition to knowledge.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teaching entrepreneurship seems clearly a growth business. In the 2010-11 school year, 260 postsecondary institutions offered entrepreneurship and small-business certificate programs, compared with 72 institutions 10 years earlier, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the Education Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We try to prepare students with what they need, but also who they need to know,'' said Raul Deju, director of the Institute of Entrepreneurial Leadership at <span class="companylink">John F. Kennedy University</span>, based in Concord, Calif. Through the institute's certificate program, which began in 2010, executives who serve as teachers might lead the way to connections and financing, he said. The program costs about $4,000, which includes meetings with mentors and potential investors, he said. More than 70 people have received certificates, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Martinez, 33, attended the program last year while working to expand his nanotechnology company, Nanotech Biomachines, based in Berkeley, Calif. The company makes an ultrathin substance known as graphene for computer and industrial applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a bachelor's and a master's in materials engineering, Mr. Martinez knew his science and technology, but he didn't know the answers to some basic business questions: How do I write a business plan? How do I find customers? How do I attract investors? He said the program helped fill those gaps. It also helped him make connections with lenders, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program ''jumps into a lot of the core things that people face,'' said Bill Wiersma, the founder and principal of a management consultancy, who teaches classes on professional values and also serves as a mentor. Starting a business is not for the faint of heart, and mentors can help entrepreneurs through the rough patches ''so they can live to fight another day,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But learning is no substitute for doing, many business people say. ''When you run a business, you learn how to make your gut work,'' said Scott Gerber, founder of the Young Entrepreneur Council, a nonprofit membership organization. ''You can't do that in a classroom setting -- there is no exception to that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certificate programs that provide experienced mentors are superior to ones that don't, he added, ''because these are people who are in the trenches.'' And it's crucial to have faculty who are real-world business people, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time it takes to complete a certificate program can vary depending on a student's other commitments. Many programs try to be flexible to accommodate full-time workers. The program at John F. Kennedy is meant to take around six months, or two quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can take less than a year to two years to complete the small-business and entrepreneurship program at Hunter College in New York, said Cristian Gallardo, associate director of continuing education. A faster pace might work for someone who was let go from their current job ''so they have to reinvent themselves,'' he said. A bachelor's degree is not required to enroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hunter College program began about three years ago to help returning military veterans, who can receive tuition and housing aid, but it is not restricted to veterans, he said. Without financial aid, the program costs $2,350.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Traverse City, Mich., the small-business/entrepreneur certificate program at <span class="companylink">Northwestern Michigan College</span> costs just $400 to $500. An aspiring entrepreneur in Traverse City, a small, resort-style community on Lake Michigan, may well be an artist or craftsman. But just like Mr. Martinez, the nanotech expert, they may be very good at what they do without possessing much business knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northwestern Michigan program offers eight classes in four core areas: starting a business, financial management, marketing and customer service. Elective classes cover topics like how to run a bed-and-breakfast, how to become a personal trainer and how to bring your business online legally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not trying to be an M.B.A. program,'' said Julie Doyal, program coordinator for the college's Extended Educational Services. ''There are plenty of those out there.'' The goal, she said, is to get people on track to fulfill their entrepreneurial goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program can be more nimble with its offerings compared with M.B.A. programs, which can require a longer curriculum review process, she said. Sometimes by the time a class has made it through the review, the skill it covers is no longer relevant, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently the program added classes on how to use Etsy, the online craft site, Ms. Doyal said. Several years ago, ''who would have even known what Etsy was? And even within Etsy, it continues to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Smith-Ronk, 38, decided to attend the program in 2009 because she knew all about making cookies but almost nothing about accounting. Through her company, Custom Cookies by Michelle, she bakes cookies and decorates them for baby showers, weddings, birthday parties, business functions and other events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always liked arts and crafts growing up, and I always liked baking,'' Ms. Smith-Ronk said. ''I just decided to combine the two of them, and I found out I was pretty good at it. I decided I would take some business classes to see if that would be a valid way for me to make some money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the program, Ms. Smith-Ronk learned how to use QuickBooks for small-business accounting. She also set up a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page after taking a class that covered using social media. She incorporated the business last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She now works as a receptionist at an auto dealership, and the cookies are a side business as she raises her young son and daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Doyal said that holding the certificate might give some added credibility to someone seeking financing. But to Ms. Smith-Ronk, the main value of it is that ''I like to know I went through the steps and tried to make myself more knowledgeable about the process'' of starting a business.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day you may have read about Patrick Robinson, the former Gap creative director, who is producing a new line, Paskho, with money he hopes to raise on Kickstarter. Among crowd-funding sites, Kickstarter is the largest, with more 30,000 projects financed and $300 million in pledges. A virtue of these sites is that for a small sum an investor can feel included in the creative process, whether it's a film or an amazing sweatshirt. If the project is successful, investors receive a reward or privilege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while this system is clearly popular, you wonder why investors don't expect something more tangible -- like, well, cash. And, as Jenna Wortham has pointed out in The New York Times, a drawback for creators is that they can spend more time communicating with investors than they anticipated. It's a pain, in short. There are also production snafus that can delay or kill a project.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Byco, a new microfinancing site, seems to address those concerns. It was conceived by Jesse Finkelstein, a retailer and manufacturer behind the downtown label JF &amp; Son, and his sister, Meredith, who formerly worked at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, where she developed financial modeling software. Byco combines old-fashioned capitalism with crowd-funding principles. But instead of a perk, investors receive 10 percent of sales, depending on how much they put in. And the designer, who receives 20 percent of sales -- or 30 percent if he or she is the sole investor -- doesn't have to deal with manufacturing, distribution and sales. Mr. Finkelstein, who works with factories in China and India, does that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not design by committee,'' he said, referring to popular crowd sites where consumers vote for designs. ''We're giving designers the means to make things. We're removing the barriers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how Byco works. A designer submits a design, say, for a dress, using an original sketch or flats that Byco provides for guidance. Mr. Finkelstein then calculates the cost of sampling and, once any changes are agreed upon, posts the sample to Byco's invest page. Investors then pay for the sample, Mr. Finkelstein manufactures it, and the item is offered for sale on Byco for about a month. The designer owns the sample, as well as any copyright, and is encouraged to promote the garment on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and other platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to let designers be designers,'' Mr. Finkelstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Byco setup is ideal for people who don't want to produce a full collection, or who are working for a fashion house as assistants and don't have the means or time to get their own stuff produced. Eventually, Mr. Finkelstein wants to offer designers the option to produce in a country of their choice, including the United States, in part to make the manufacturing process transparent and in part to show the differences in costs. Realistically, retail prices on Byco will be modest: roughly $150 to $350 for a dress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Finkelstein and his partner at JF &amp; Son, Katie King, have been fairly quick-minded about the industry. In 2007, they opened a design studio in India (Mr. Finkelstein sort of grew up in the manufacturing business; his father produces home products.) About four years ago they opened a store in NoLIta and then moved to University Place. They acquired customer expertise and a library of fabrics, which will be useful to Byco patrons. They have done curatorial projects, most recently with the Museum of Art and Design, and spinoff labels, like Family, a successful sweatshirt line. Last summer, Ms. King and Mr. Finkelstein decided to close their retail store (it was taking too much of their time, he said) and focus on Family and online sales -- and, of course, Byco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the temptation in the fashion industry to imitate, Mr. Finkelstein will be on the lookout for copycats among Byco users. He also said that Byco has the means to offer designers a wide range of sizing since production minimums -- typically an obstacle for small companies -- aren't an issue for the site.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBAI -- When Amal Al-Agroobi and Hana Makki, two filmmakers in Dubai, began raising money for a documentary on autism in the United Arab Emirates six months ago, they did not get much attention from government or film festival grant sources. They needed $15,000 to start filming, with a plan to raise the remaining $45,000 for postproduction costs later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After futile attempts to raise money through conventional methods, the two turned to a new means of financing projects in the region through crowdfunding online -- trying to obtain money on the Internet.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than using Kickstarter or Indiegogo, which are popular global online platforms that gather money from the public for a variety of projects, they turned to a new platform called Aflamnah, which means ''our movies'' in Arabic. It started last July in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had never tried crowdfunding before, but since this is a social documentary, it made sense to involve people in funding the project to raise awareness about autism and gain an audience for our film locally,'' said Ms. Agroobi, the co-director of ''A Brain That Sings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Agroobi, who is of Emirati and Syrian origin and lives in Dubai, said, ''If local crowdfunding didn't exist, we wouldn't be filming right now,''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Access to funding is still difficult in the region. Most entrepreneurs turn to a handful of venture capitalists or angel investors for money. Bank lending also remains tight, and for those in creative fields like filmmaking, raising money can be very difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filmmakers rely on grants from large film festivals, like the Dubai International Film Festival, or a few government grants, but competition is fierce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem here is that there are few funding bodies and at the same time our culture is looking for mainstream films, so it was difficult to pitch a local documentary about children with social needs when all you see playing in cinemas are Hollywood movies,'' said Ms. Makki, the co-director of the Arabic-language film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the Mideast, people are ashamed of having children who are different and there's a culture of absolute silence regarding special needs, '' she said. '' We want our film to change that stigma and to encourage the country to provide necessary services to help these families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Aflamnah, they raised the $15,000 for ''A Brain That Sings'' to tell the story of living with autism through the eyes of Mohammed, a 19-year-old Yemeni, and Khalifa, a 6-year-old Emirati. One of the themes of the film is how music therapy helps children communicate in a world they don't understand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filming will continue until the end of May. Then fund-raising will begin again for postproduction costs to complete the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will probably turn to crowdfunding again to raise money for postproduction,'' said Ms. Makki, who is Yemeni and British. ''You would think it would be easier to get access to funding through some sort of grant, because Amal is Emirati, but it's been difficult for us, and it's crowdfunding that made our plans a reality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aflamnah is modeled after Kickstarter, a global platform that started in 2009 in New York to gather money from the public for creative projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Aflamnah started, some entrepreneurs based in Dubai were turning to global platforms like Kickstarter to try to raise funds, instead of banks or venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna Stillwell and Erika Ilves, who are both based in Dubai, raised their target of $25,000 in just five days on Kickstarter for ''The Human Project,'' a multimedia book on the challenges for the survival of humanity after disasters like pandemics and asteroid impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the Internet, if your ideas are sound and you're willing to break a sweat and stick with it, you can find people scattered all over the world who want to back you,'' Ms. Stillwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of their campaign in November 2011, ''The Human Project'' had almost doubled the goal and raised $46,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're staring at the computer screen and receiving $1,000 from a Bangladeshi-Iranian we've never met and $250 from a South African woman,'' Ms. Stillwell said. ''Crowdfunding is a platform that brings ideas and interested financial backers together, and with such diversity, it's clear that crowdfunding is not just a passing trend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there are more than 100 clones of Kickstarter worldwide and Aflamnah is one of the first to cater to entrepreneurs for creative projects specifically in the Arab world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still testing the waters to see if crowdfunding really takes off here, but there is demand for more financing of creative projects in this part of the world,'' said Vida Rizq, co-founder of Aflamnah who used to manage film productions for Dubai International Film Festival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aflamnah, which has 31 projects listed since it started in July 2012, takes 6 percent of money raised and asks clients to pay a $100 upload fee that is used to market their project. The largest single contribution so far was $5,000, and the average contribution is $140.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is catching on, with another entry to the crowdfunding market by the end of this month: Zoomal, whose mandate also is to focus on projects in the Arab world or by Arabs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need something like this in the Arab world to support concept ideas, unlike venture capital firms that need to see a track record of success in a company that's already making money before they invest,'' said Abdallah Absi, an experienced entrepreneur and founder of Zoomal. ''It's still a new model in a market that is immature, but there's a clear demand for this kind of financial support at a very early stage that simply doesn't exist yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is in Arabic and has received financing from four prominent venture capital firms in the region, including Wamda Capital, which is based in Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crowdfunding not only lowers frictions to access capital, but allows the creation of projects that could significantly improve societies in the Middle East,'' said Habib Haddad, chief executive of Wamda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges still remain in terms of educating the market on the benefits and safety of pledging money online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though it is still too early to determine the success of crowdfunding in the region, one thing is clear: The demand for new avenues of financing is strong.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has hammered her over the surging level of fines against small businesses, chided her for not demanding greater oversight of New York's police and denounced her for failing to support a bill providing paid time off for sick workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, the mayoral campaign of Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, has seemed like a crusade to shame Christine C. Quinn, a rival in the Democratic primary for mayor, into adopting the most cherished positions of their party's liberal wing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His problem: She is starting to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limitations of Mr. de Blasio's strategy were laid bare on Friday when Ms. Quinn, the City Council speaker, struck a compromise with liberal advocates and unions to pass the paid sick-leave legislation she had long blocked. Advocates called the agreement imperfect, but still showed up to applaud her at a celebratory news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the latest episode in which Ms. Quinn's deal-making acumen deprived Mr. de Blasio of a potent line of attack, showcasing the power that her incumbency as speaker gives her to outmaneuver opponents in the race for mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past several weeks, amid criticism from Mr. de Blasio, Ms. Quinn has introduced legislation to create a police inspector general and to reduce fines levied on street vendors, seemingly timing her announcements for maximum political effect: her office unveiled the street vendor bill minutes before Mr. de Blasio was to assail her at a news conference at City Hall on the same subject.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As effective as Ms. Quinn's tactics can be, she runs the risk of appearing more pragmatic than principled, leading some critics to question what, precisely, she stands for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had long resisted paid sick-leave legislation, saying that in a tough economy, the requirement would be too burdensome for businesses. But late Thursday, without much warning, she accepted a deal that would require thousands of businesses to provide the benefit, covering more than 800,000 of the 1.3 million New Yorkers who do not currently have it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he castigated Ms. Quinn on Friday for not pursuing a more comprehensive bill that would cover more workers, Mr. de Blasio suggested her recent embrace of liberal issues had been belated and cynical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's not leadership,'' the public advocate said at a news conference. ''That's acquiescence to public pressure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a later interview, Mr. de Blasio predicted that Democratic primary voters would see through Ms. Quinn's reactive approach and favor a candidate more in tune with its liberal wing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm talking about the values of Democratic voters in New York City,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''If the speaker constantly has to reach for that, as opposed to being naturally in that position, it's a problem for her.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At City Hall on Friday, Ms. Quinn played down any lingering doubts about the sick-leave compromise, saying she had secured a deal where ''all sides ended up having a voice.'' Echoing a theme of her campaign, she described it as an example of ''what effective policy making is all about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quinn campaign moved quickly to portray her as an inclusive champion of the middle class, sending a message to supporters in which Ms. Quinn pledged, ''I will never stop bringing New Yorkers together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But people with knowledge of the negotiations over the sick-leave bill said Ms. Quinn only reluctantly joined the discussions, hours after discovering that a dozen council members had signed an unusual petition that would seek to force a vote on the measure despite her opposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn, seeking to prevent the imminent filing of the petition, said she would discuss a deal. But she at first insisted on a broad exemption for small businesses that employ thousands of workers. Frustrated by the speaker's position, advocates issued an ultimatum: Unless Ms. Quinn agreed to apply the requirement to businesses with as few as 20 workers, the talks would be off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, as they stood with the speaker to celebrate the agreement, advocates still conveyed that Ms. Quinn had played a grudging role in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We hit her pretty hard on this, and she got pushed to the point where she needed to negotiate,'' said Javier H. Valdes, an executive director of Make the Road, a group involved in the negotiations. ''When she did see that writing on the wall, she took a leadership role in finalizing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feminist writer Gloria Steinem, who had said she would withhold her endorsement of Ms. Quinn if she did not allow a vote on the paid sick-leave measure, thanked the speaker for the compromise. But in a statement, Ms. Steinem pointedly referred to ''the 1 percent'' that had pressured leaders like Ms. Quinn to block action on the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the city's most powerful unions, 1199, registered a starker form of disapproval, withholding its support for the compromise this week when advocates were asked to endorse it, according to people involved in negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The murmurs of discontent on Friday provided some solace to Mr. de Blasio, who insisted the paid sick-leave question ''remains absolutely alive in the debate about the future of our city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio said he would join the Rev. Al Sharpton at a weekend rally to call for a more stringent sick-leave measure in New York, and he took pains to explain why advocates were now willing to stand by Ms. Quinn's side. ''As the saying goes,'' Mr. de Blasio said, ''when a hungry man is offered half a loaf, he will take it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, hours after Ms. Quinn's boisterous news conference had ended on the steps of City Hall, it was clear that the day's political momentum was with her. Shortly after she finished, Mr. de Blasio delivered his remarks, standing behind a spare lectern, all alone.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Unable to meet tight deadlines in the new health care law, the Obama administration is delaying parts of a program intended to provide affordable health insurance to small businesses and their employees -- a major selling point for the health care legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law calls for a new insurance marketplace specifically for small businesses, starting next year. But in most states, employers will not be able to get what Congress intended: the option to provide workers with a choice of health plans. They will instead be limited to a single plan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The choice option, already available to many big businesses, was supposed to become available to small employers in January. But administration officials said they would delay it until 2015 in the 33 states where the federal government will be running insurance markets known as exchanges. And they will delay the requirement for other states as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promise of affordable health insurance for small businesses was portrayed as a major advantage of the new health care law, mentioned often by White House officials and Democratic leaders in Congress as they fought opponents of the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the law said they were disappointed by the turn of events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay will ''prolong and exacerbate health care costs that are crippling 29 million small businesses,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana and the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the weeks leading up to the passage of the health care legislation in 2010, Ms. Landrieu provided crucial support for the measure, after securing changes to help small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration cited ''operational challenges'' as a reason for the delay. As a result, it said, most small employers buying insurance through an exchange will offer a single health plan to their workers next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health insurance availability and cost are huge concerns for small businesses. They have less bargaining power than large companies and generally pay higher prices for insurance, if they can afford it at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2010 law stipulates that each state will have a Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP exchange, to help employers compare health plans and enroll their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most important tasks of the exchange is to simplify the collection and payment of monthly premiums. An employer can pay a lump sum to the exchange, which will then distribute the money to each insurance company covering its employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration told employers in 2011 that the small business exchange would ''enable you to offer your employees a choice of qualified health plans from several insurers, much as large employers can.'' In addition, it said, the exchange would ''consolidate billing so you can offer workers a choice without the hassle of contracting with multiple insurers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exchanges are scheduled to start enrolling people on Oct. 1, for coverage that begins in January. However, the administration said that the government and insurers needed ''additional time to prepare for an employee choice model'' of the type envisioned in the law signed three years ago by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D. Michael Roach, who owns a women's clothing store in Portland, Ore., said the delay was ''a real mistake.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will limit the attractiveness of exchanges to small business,'' he said. ''We would like to see different insurance carriers available to each of our 12 employees, who range in age from 21 to 62. You would have more competition, more downward pressure on rates, and employees would be more likely to get exactly what they wanted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John C. Arensmeyer, the chief executive of Small Business Majority, an advocacy group, said that the delay of ''employee choice'' was ''a major letdown for small business owners and their employees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The vast majority of small employers want their employees to be able to choose among multiple insurance carriers,'' Mr. Arensmeyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small Business Majority supported Mr. Obama's health care law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That support was invaluable to Democrats who pushed the bill through Congress. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who was speaker at the time, cited the group's research as evidence that ''small businesses will benefit from health insurance reform.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in recent weeks, insurance companies urged the administration to delay the employee choice option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Experience with Massachusetts has demonstrated that employee choice models are extremely cumbersome to establish and operate,'' the health insurer <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> said in a letter to the administration in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers said that the administration was partly responsible for the delay because it did not provide detailed guidance or final rules for the small-business exchange until last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses with up to 100 employees will be able to buy insurance in the exchanges. In 2014 and 2015, states can limit participation to businesses with 50 or fewer employees. Companies with fewer than 25 workers may be able to obtain tax credits for up to two years of coverage bought through an exchange. States can open the exchanges to large employers in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few states running their own exchanges, including California and Connecticut, said they planned to offer an employee choice option next year, though it was not required by the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stated goal of the 2010 law was to increase ''consumer choice'' and stimulate competition among insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law makes it easier for consumers to compare health plans by defining four standard levels of coverage, ranging from the least to the most generous. The law says an employer can pick a level of coverage and then allow employees to choose among all the health plans available at that level.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- With Britain's moribund economy struggling to avert a return to recession, a government-backed lending program was extended and reworked Wednesday in the hope of freeing up borrowing to credit-starved small and medium-size companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative, announced a day before official figures will show whether Britain has avoided a third extended contraction in five years, underlines concerns about the difficulty British companies still face in raising cash after the financial crisis.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Introduced last year, the program, the Funding for Lending Scheme, allows British banks that extend credit to borrow from the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>, against a wide range of collateral, at an annual interest rate as low as one-quarter of a percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plans announced Wednesday, the program will be extended for a year until January 2015. It will focus more on smaller businesses, and participating banks will be able to lend to alternative providers of credit like financial leasing and factoring corporations, which help small companies raise money, and to mortgage and housing credit corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its inception last August, the program has had mixed results, and the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> says that an improvement in credit conditions has been less marked for smaller businesses than for larger businesses and households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank said last month that in the fourth quarter of last year, 11 financial institutions made total drawdowns of £9.5 billion, or $14.5 billion, under the program, taking the total amount drawn to £13.8 billion. But it said that overall net lending by participating banks was down over the quarter by £2.4 billion, or $3.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes mean that for every £1 of additional lending by banks to small and medium-size businesses in the rest of 2013, the amount of funding that banks will be able to draw upon increases by £10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> and Treasury are throwing the kitchen sink at the problem,'' Robert Wood, chief economist for Britain at <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span> in London, said. He added that as well as helping small businesses, the move may lift the British housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tight credit conditions have been a key factor in the holding back recovery,'' he wrote in a commentary. ''This extension should help to solve that. The terms on offer to banks are now about as generous as they could possibly be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wood added, however, that the move was not a silver bullet, both because of the broader economic situation and because of pressure on banks to build up their capital reserves to reduce risks in future financial crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Firms are not borrowing and investing because the outlook for the economy is weak as strong headwinds, from Euro-worries to weak household income, are keeping confidence under wraps,'' he wrote. ''The scheme also requires banks to want to lend more. Banks are under heavy pressure from the other arm of the B.O.E. to raise more capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, said in a statement that an extension of the program was ''valuable, as it gives banks continued assurance against the risk that market funding rates increase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, described the move as a big lift for small and medium-size businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Funding for Lending Scheme has already reduced the costs of household mortgages and loans for businesses,'' he said in a statement. ''This innovative extension will now do even more for small and medium-sized businesses so that they can play their full part in creating new jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne has faced increased criticism since the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> raised doubts last week about the pace of his deficit reduction strategy, and Fitch became the second credit ratings agency to strip Britain of its prized triple-A credit rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, first-quarter economic output data will be released, showing whether Britain's economy has slipped into a triple-dip recession, as some analysts have predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Leslie, Treasury spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, welcomed the move announced Wednesday but said it fell short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite scheme after scheme -- from the failed Project Merlin deal with the banks to credit easing and now Funding for Lending -- net lending to businesses has fallen month by month under this government,'' he said. ''Labour called for reforms to this scheme last year, so these belated changes are welcome. But with net lending to businesses down by £4.8 billion in the last three months alone, they do not go far enough.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- Smaller companies that provide most of the jobs in Europe face an ever more difficult struggle to win customers and get bank loans, according to a survey from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> on Friday that contributed to a picture of spreading economic stagnation in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small and midsize companies in South European countries like Spain and Italy reported the most trouble making a profit, maintaining revenue and getting loans, according to the E.C.B. survey of 7,500 firms. Underscoring the plight of people in Southern Europe, the Spanish government said Friday that economic growth in coming years could be even worse than previously thought.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the survey also pointed to signs of trouble in Northern Europe, further raising expectations that the E.C.B. might be all but compelled to cut its main interest rate in the coming week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems very difficult for the E.C.B. to leave the monetary policy stance unchanged,'' Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>, said in an e-mail. Economists expect the E.C.B. to cut its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent when it meets Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. economic growth continues to stand in contrast to Europe's. The American economy sped up in the first quarter of this year, with output expanding at an annual pace of 2.5 percent, according to a U.S. Commerce Department report Friday. That number was lower than the 3 percent forecasters had been expecting, but it is a rosy picture compared with the doldrums in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, companies in Germany and other North European countries had come through the euro zone crisis relatively unscathed. But the E.C.B. survey found that a growing number of companies in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria were suffering, with more and more reporting that ''finding customers'' was now their biggest worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the 17 countries in the euro zone are more and more in the same economic boat, though, tensions among their leaders are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a position paper prepared for a coming political convention, and quoted by the French newspaper Le Monde, leading members of France's Socialist Party complained of what they said was ''the selfish intransigence'' of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Merkel, the document said, ''cares only for the bank depositors of the upper Rhine, the trade balance in Berlin and her electoral future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Merkel raised eyebrows Thursday when, in remarks to German bankers, she said that Germany should have higher, not lower, interest rates. It is considered taboo for a political leader to try to put pressure on the E.C.B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the E.C.B. survey, conducted in February and March and which focused on firms with fewer than 250 employees, companies throughout the euro zone reported declines in profit, except in Germany and Austria. Even in those countries, though, earnings were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with separate data from the E.C.B. that showed a dip in bank lending last month, the survey adds to a growing body of evidence that a recovery of the euro zone economy may not materialize until next year. The figures suggest that, while fear of a breakup of the 17-member euro zone has ebbed, the currency union is at risk of long-term stagnation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a document has come to light in which Jens Weidmann, president of the <span class="companylink">German central bank</span>, the Bundesbank, argued that some measures by the E.C.B., which are largely responsible for the decline in financial stress, would be illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidmann made the critique in an opinion he submitted in December to the German Constitutional Court, which is considering a complaint against Germany's participation in measures designed to keep the euro zone together. The 29-page document was confidential until Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper, published it Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidmann wrote that the E.C.B. would violate its mandate if it bought government bonds of euro zone members on a huge scale, as it has pledged to do if needed to keep down borrowing costs for troubled countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The E.C.B. has not needed to buy any bonds because the promise alone has been enough to calm financial markets. In one sign of receding financial tension, bank data compiled by the E.C.B. and published Friday showed no sign of a flight by depositors following turmoil in Cyprus last month, except in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidmann wrote to the Constitutional Court that E.C.B. bond purchases ''would burden the independence of the central bank, which is a central precondition for successful fulfillment of its main duty -- defending price stability.'' The Bundesbank confirmed the authenticity of the document.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is no surprise that Mr. Weidmann opposes E.C.B. bond buying, but publication of his remarks was a reminder of divisions within the E.C.B.'s Governing Council, of which he is a member.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidmann is scheduled to testify before the Constitutional Court in June. The court probably does not have the power to block E.C.B. action, but a ruling critical of the bank might make it harder for it to act if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an E.C.B. rate cut is now widely expected, it could be the subject of intense debate when policy makers meet Thursday. A cut may be unwelcome in Germany, where low borrowing costs have helped fuel a sharp rise in real estate prices in some metropolitan areas during the last year. That might have been part of the impulse for Ms. Merkel's remarks on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Chancellor Merkel, insisted that she had not intended to encroach on the central bank's independence. ''There is no reason to assume that the chancellor meant to give any kind of warning or suggestion to the E.C.B. in her speech,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the northern countries risk sliding into recession, the downturn along the Mediterranean has been getting worse. The Spanish government on Friday gave a darker forecast for the economy, saying it expected a contraction this year of 1.3 percent compared with an earlier forecast of a 0.5 percent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, said Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, the deputy prime minister, the economy would grow 0.5 percent. Unemployment would rise to 27.1 percent this year and fall to 26.7 percent next year, she said, according to Reuters.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the dream of entrepreneurs to sell their company for millions of dollars. But the dirty secret of venture capital is that the dream can be dashed as the venture capitalists make millions in a sale, leaving the founders with nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent Delaware court case arising from the 2011 sale of <span class="companylink">Bloodhound Technologies</span> illustrates how this happens.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloodhound was founded in the mid-1990s by Joseph A. Carsanaro to create fraud-monitoring software for health care claims. After several years of going it alone with a handful of colleagues, Mr. Carsanaro was able to raise Bloodhound's first venture capital round for $1.9 million in 1999, followed by a second $3.1 million round in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Internet bubble burst, the company underwent rocky times. It was then that the venture capitalists seized control. Mr. Carsanaro was pushed out as chief executive. By 2000, he was gone from the company, as were four other members of his founding team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next decade, Bloodhound recovered and slowly grew, raising seven more rounds of financing. In April 2011, the company was sold for $82.5 million. It was a time for Mr. Carsanaro and his founding team to celebrate their millionaire status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But venture capital investments are structured to ensure that the venture capitalists are paid before founders and employees. When venture capitalists invest, they typically demand preferred shares that accrue a yearly dividend of about 8 percent. The dividend goes unpaid until the company is sold. In a sale, the original amount and the interest all come due. It must be paid out before the common shares, which are typically held by the founders and other employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The requirement that the venture capitalist be paid first, and with interest, can sometimes hit founders and employees in a brutal manner, as Mr. Carsanaro and his colleagues discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture capitalists took almost all of the sale price. Bloodhound also paid a $15 million bonus to its current management team. The five founders of Bloodhound were paid in total less than $36,000. One received all of $99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is not much information on payouts to founders and employees when a company backed by venture capital is sold. But from the few studies on the subject, it appears that the situation involving Bloodhound is all too common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent study, by Profs. Brian J. Broughman and Jesse M. Fried, found that among a sample of venture capital deals, the common investors in roughly half the cases were entitled to nothing when the company was sold, even when the sale was for tens of millions. And in all but one instance, the majority of the sale proceeds went to the venture capitalists and other holders of preferred shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unpublished study by Shikhar Ghosh at the Harvard Business School found that three out of four companies backed by venture capital did not return the investment. Again, it is in these cases where the founders and employees typically are entitled to receive no payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those entrepreneurs who think they will be the next Mark Zuckerberg and ride their company to riches, think again. A number of studies have found that most chief executives of companies that take venture capital investments end up being replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the successful businesses. The rule of thumb among venture capitalists is that some 20 percent to 30 percent of companies fail, returning nothing to any investor, including the venture capitalists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloodhound case is a reminder that the founders of start-ups backed by venture capital often end up nothing like Mr. Zuckerberg. Instead, they find themselves thrown out and without significant profits even if their company is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists will argue that this is the price to pay to get their money and services. Cash is king, and in order to survive, venture capitalists will demand a high price and return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet entrepreneurs can protect themselves. Professors Broughman and Fried found in their study that founders who negotiated greater control rights ended up receiving on average $3.7 million more. They did this even when the common shareholders were not entitled to a dime. By negotiating board seats or other representation, the founders were able to ensure that a sale happened only with their approval and a demand for some payment in return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the rights negotiated by entrepreneurs when taking venture capital money really matter. Many entrepreneurs are so excited to get money that they don't push for such rights or just don't know to ask. Yet those who negotiate to keep a say in their company have a future, while those who don't are more likely to be tossed aside. And it can be that this happens even in lucrative situations. Remember that Mr. Zuckerberg would have been forced by his venture capital investors to sell <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> had he not kept control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Bloodhound, its founders were pushed out of the company about eight years before the sale. During that time, they lacked control or ability to stop the venture capitalists from financing the company on the venture capitalists' terms. The only substantial communication the founders had after they left was when they found out that the company had been sold for a huge price and that they would receive almost nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five founders sued in Delaware court, claiming that Bloodhound's board and the venture capitalists had structured later rounds to favor themselves and dilute the payout of the founders. In a motion, the defendants countered that they acted fairly and that the plaintiffs' claims were untimely because they were brought years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. Travis Laster, vice chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court, found that the claims that the venture capitalist had favored themselves to the detriment of the founders could be a viable claim claim if the facts they stated were true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Bloodhound's founders are successful in their lawsuit, the case could change practices. It might require boards that take venture capital money to consider the founders and their interests before taking the next round. This could force boards to lean against diluting the payout of the founders and employees to avoid litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even if Bloodhound's founders prevail, other entrepreneurs will sometimes find that their company is sold with nothing going to them. The sad reality is that there are times when the price demanded by the venture capitalists for the company to survive means that the founders will lose. Let's face it, sometimes the company survives only because of that money and the skill and effort that the venture capitalists put in. This may have been the case in Bloodhound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Bloodhound case publicizes this practice and will perhaps push boards to think harder before the founders are discarded. This may foster caution among venture capitalists, but the only thing that will truly save entrepreneurs is negotiating harder in the beginning. They may otherwise find themselves like the Bloodhound founders, left with nothing.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 2011, a group of American high-tech executives and angel investors traveled to North Africa as part of an innovative State Department economic development program. Local entrepreneurs flocked to workshops in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, where the Americans judged their business proposals and encouraged them to open start-ups. The initiative embodied the ''economic statecraft'' at the heart of Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton's vision for American foreign policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the program turned out to be so poorly financed that it had no prize for the winners. Embarrassed delegates cobbled one together: an internship at a start-up incubator in Detroit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Middle East is an economic powder keg. About 60 percent of the Arab world's population is under the age of 30; millions of jobs are needed or already high unemployment levels will explode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's efforts in the region should be more economic than military. ''The United States government has done a terrible job of focusing on economic issues in the Middle East,'' Thomas R. Nides, a former deputy secretary of state, told me recently. ''You have huge youth unemployment and no hope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This argument is hardly new. ''To succeed, the Arab political awakening must also be an economic awakening,'' Mrs. Clinton said, more than a year ago. ''Economic policy is foreign policy,'' her successor, John Kerry, said this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month he asked Congress to approve the creation of a $580 million ''incentive fund'' that would reward countries in the Middle East and North Africa for enacting reforms that foster market-based economies, democratic norms, independent courts and civil societies. But Mrs. Clinton's proposal for a similar fund received scant support last year from a Congress that was understandably focused on domestic issues. With the sequester now in effect, Mr. Kerry's request could suffer the same fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Iraq and Afghanistan, it's no longer politically feasible to sponsor vast development initiatives with little regard for whether they create self-sustaining growth for the region. We must find innovative ways to conduct economic statecraft in an age of austerity. The incentive fund -- a small fraction of the $1.2 trillion Washington has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan -- is a good start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some countries in the region have had success implementing, on their own, the kinds of reforms the fund would encourage. Over the past decade, Turkey has carried out a harsh <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> economic reform program, opened its economy and attracted foreign investment as part of its effort to join the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. Today, few Turkish business owners care if the country is part of the union. In 2011, Turkey boasted a faster growing economy than any other European nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the West Bank, the economic and security reforms of Salam Fayyad, who recently resigned as prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, deserve much praise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kerry should also focus aid in areas where viable markets and partners exist. Tareq Maayah, a Palestinian engineer who runs a West Bank high-tech firm, said $100,000 from the <span class="companylink">United States Agency for International Development</span> helped his firm gain a tryout with <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>. Today, his company writes software for Cisco, <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> and <span class="companylink">Alcatel-Lucent</span>, with no government assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahmed El Alfi, an Egyptian-American Silicon Valley venture capital investor, said American officials could ''do a lot more'' at little cost. Mr. Alfi, who began a high-tech incubator in Cairo, said Egyptian start-ups clamor for access to American investors. ''Have a weekly call for companies from the region doing 10-minute presentations to American companies,'' he suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Mr. Kerry should emphasize to American companies that investment opportunities exist in the region, particularly in infrastructure, energy and aviation. Chinese firms exported an estimated $150 billion to the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, twice as much as American firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some countries in the region are too unstable for American private investment. But in others, public-private initiatives that foster trade, investment and job creation with little taxpayer funding could be expanded. The high-tech entrepreneurship delegations started by Mrs. Clinton should be increased and properly funded. Wealthy Persian Gulf countries should be asked to finance a regional bank for small and medium-size enterprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most important, we should stop thinking we can transform societies overnight. Even if the United States perfectly executes its policies and programs, they alone will not stabilize countries. We need viable local partners. Nations must transform themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should scale back our ambitions and concentrate on long-term economics. By trying to do fewer things over longer periods, we will achieve more.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Note Records, a storied label in jazz, has plans to partner with ArtistShare, a pioneering crowd-financing platform, for a hybrid called Blue Note/ArtistShare. The joint venture suggests one tactical response to the pressures now facing the record business, especially in and around the jazz field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new arrangement -- orchestrated by Brian Camelio, the founder of ArtistShare; Bruce Lundvall, chairman emeritus of Blue Note; and Don Was, Blue Note's president -- will essentially serve as a low-risk development arm of the label. Blue Note will help select the artists, and apply its imprimatur and promotional resources to each finished album. But the costs of recording will be shouldered by fans, in the standard mode of ArtistShare projects. Musicians will retain full ownership of their master recordings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Young artists worldwide are making fresh musical statements left and right, but are forced to do their own marketing campaigns, too, often when their main focus should be their creative output,'' Mr. Lundvall said in a statement released on Wednesday. While Blue Note/ArtistShare has the potential to lighten that burden, it still leaves the artist in charge of his or her own fund-raising efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in ArtistShare, which Mr. Camelio formed a decade ago, there's an admirable track record, one that predates Kickstarter, by far the best-known brand in crowd-financing. (There have been some recent legal entanglements between the two companies.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The composer-bandleader Maria Schneider, who just released her third album through ArtistShare, has been its emblematic success story, winning widespread acclaim and multiple Grammy awards. Among the other prominent jazz musicians using ArtistShare are the pianist Billy Childs and the guitarist Jim Hall. But experienced, established figures like these will expressly not be the focus of Blue Note/ArtistShare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, its emphasis will be on up-and-comers, acts on which Blue Note has historically prided itself. The label recently released well-received albums by the singer José James and the pianist Robert Glasper; among its coming releases is a debut effort by the bassist Derrick Hodge, due on Aug. 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Patrice Wynne shuttered her independent bookstore, Gaia, in Berkeley, Calif., and retired, she knew three things. She wanted to move to a place where she could slow down the tempo of her life, and it was cheaper to live, but where she could continue to work in some fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I promised myself -- I'm not going to slip into going to cocktail parties and playing tennis,'' Ms. Wynne, 61, said. ''I wanted engagement.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's what she got. Three years ago, along a cobblestone street in the center of San Miguel de Allende in Mexico, she opened Abrazos, a 650-square-foot retail shop selling colorful Mexican-themed fabric aprons, kitchen and cooking accessories, handbags and clothing, all sewn by a dozen local seamstresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply retiring abroad has become old news, as people seek cheaper places to live and to slash health care costs while enjoying more temperate climes. But now enjoying a ''working retirement,'' like Ms. Wynne's, appears to be gaining traction with expats, as it has in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, an increasing number of retirees, who can expect to live longer, healthier lives, are choosing to work in retirement, at least part-time, typically for fear of outliving their money or to keep active and engaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a dearth of hard numbers on American retirees abroad, the same seems to be true for them, to judge from the rising number of Social Security checks sent to Americans living in inexpensive retirement havens in Latin America and the Caribbean, and from much anecdotal evidence from expatriate retiree-entrepreneurs like Ms. Wynne and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems that the factors that are driving continued work later in life, including part-time work, would be the same for Americans at home and abroad,'' said Kevin Cahill, an economist with the Sloan Center on Aging and Work at Boston College. ''So I think it's fair to say that, if the employment opportunities exist, we shouldn't be surprised to see similar trends with respect to part-time employment for U.S. retirees living abroad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a wide range of jobs that globe trotters may consider. Of course, there's the possibility of accepting contract assignments from former employers. And there are often positions available to teach English, work as a translator, lead English-speaking tours, or work at hotels that cater to English-speaking travelers, according to Betsy Burlingame, founder of ExpatExchange.com, a leading Web site on international living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many countries, though, you are required to have a work permit for certain jobs and prove there are not citizens there who could fill the position, she added. In Panama, for example, you can't work as a doctor or nurse unless you are a Panamanian citizen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many expats, like Ms. Wynne, start their own businesses like restaurants, shops, real estate agencies, art galleries, bed-and-breakfasts and small hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those with an entrepreneurial bent, International Living, a magazine and Web site specializing in retirement abroad, has published an index of the countries with the best conditions for starting a business. The index factors in things like visa requirements, the ease of setting up a bank account, expenses, local taxes and language barriers. In the most recent survey, Panama was the winner, followed by Belize, Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ms. Wynne, Mexico appealed for several reasons. It was a country she had visited frequently over the years and where she spoke the language. There were also plenty of expats, the weather was appealing, and it was affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $105,000, Ms. Wynne bought a single-family home with vistas of the entire city of San Miguel de Allende, a cultural hub in central Mexico, and the surrounding countryside. She spent about $35,000 to modernize it and found happy surprises along the way. ''Everything from food to flowers to medical care were considerably less than anything I had known for the last 25 years in California,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her ability to inexpensively start a small business, initially in her home, was critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynne's start-up costs for Abrazos totaled about $12,400 for the basics, including inventory, lighting, advertising and computers. And since opening the shop in January 2010, her monthly rent of $600 is a fraction of the $8,000 she was paying for her bookshop space in Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, rents in San Miguel de Allende are 72.6 percent lower than in San Francisco, according to Numbeo, an online database of user-contributed information about the cost of living in cities around the world. Restaurant prices there are 54.4 percent lower than the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady retail sales, which have increased 25 percent since the year the shop opened, provide enough income to allow Ms. Wynne to live a comfortable lifestyle with plenty of time to travel and even visit her parents in Pennsylvania, without having to tap into her retirement accounts. And she has no plans to start the clock on her Social Security payments when she becomes eligible next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But her decision to open a business and keep working goes deeper than the monetary reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you make a decision to live abroad, there's never a singular reason,'' Ms. Wynne said. ''There's always a complexity of reasons. Yes, it has to do with affordability and having your retirement income be expanded. But like other expats working here, I wanted to be adventurous and have new learning opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, she feels ''jazzed on life,'' she said. ''By opening my store, I place myself in the pulse of the community. We're on a main thoroughfare so people drop in and talk to me. My life is a touchstone into other lives in the community. I feel healthier and more alive because I am embedded in these social networks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for many who work in the Internet age, it does not matter much where you live these days, and this can be especially true for retirees abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Prescher, International Living's special projects editor, and his wife, Suzan Haskins, are both writers living in Cotacachi, a tiny town in Ecuador, since closing their marketing and public relations firm in Omaha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have a job that you can do online, ''you can do it from anywhere on the planet,'' Mr. Prescher said. ''You don't have to pick a place depending on whether there's a job opportunity there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His advice: Take your profession and turn it into a business you can do online. For example, if you have been a dietitian, you can be a consulting dietitian online. You can be a proofreader online, an editor online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All my wife and I need is a laptop and an Internet connection,'' he said. ''We can send in our stories and our photographs to editors anywhere in the world. Instead of retiring, we retried our lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turalu Brady Murdock, a lawyer who specializes in title insurance, has also discovered the allure of virtual work in retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Murdock, 68, and her husband live in El Tránsito, a small fishing town just off the Pacific coast of Central Nicaragua, in a 10,000-square-foot house (interior patios included) perched on a hillside 200 feet above the rolling ocean waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, she retired as vice president in charge of Latin America and the Caribbean for <span class="companylink">First American Title Insurance Company</span>, based in Washington, where she had worked for more than three decades. Her primary duties had been to help individuals and companies obtain title insurance for properties they were buying in those regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While she lived in many places during her First American career, including New Orleans, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico and Miami, her final posting was in Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When her employer closed the office, she chose to stay in Nicaragua. ''I didn't think I was going to actually work.'' Ms. Murdock said. ''But people kept asking me the same questions they had for years when I worked at First American. So with a former employee, I started a consulting business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her firm, Title Coordination Services, is based in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, but Ms. Murdock does not have an office, and the two women do everything by e-mail and phone, so there is no overhead cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few downsides. For instance, the Internet connection goes in and out at times, and the electricity has been known to fail for six hours at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Murdock charges an hourly fee of $150 for advice, as well as a flat fee of $250 for specific searches, like setting someone up with a local lawyer or surveyor. The online consulting business brings in roughly $30,000 a year, which the women split.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's nice about it is that I can put in as few or as many hours as I want,'' she said. ''A typical week might mean seven or eight hours of work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with Ms. Wynne, there's more to the work than the financial appeal. ''I really like being connected with people,'' Ms. Murdock said. ''I love learning about the new laws and the intellectual fun of it, trying to figure out how to get something done, how to work with a particular attorney in a particular country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working abroad may sound swell, especially if you can be gazing off at the sand and surf and padding around in your flip-flops while you do it. But it can be complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, making mistakes on taxes is common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to work overseas and earn even a modest salary, you must find a tax adviser expert in international tax issues,'' said Olivia S. Mitchell, a risk management professor who focuses on retirement policy and serves as the executive director of the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You should make sure you're doing everything right because there are some tricky tax laws for Americans living overseas,'' Professor Mitchell said. ''Both the United States and an expat's country of residence could try to tax your earned income while living overseas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States government requires American citizens living and working abroad to file an American tax return annually. Americans working abroad, however, are eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion, which in 2013 exempts the first $97,600 from tax. If you earn much more than this threshold and you pay income taxes to a foreign government, you may be able to take a foreign tax credit. In any event, this can require working with a tax adviser aware of the ins and outs of these policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who are moving abroad and plan to work need to go in with their eyes wide open,'' Professor Mitchell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before I would decide to settle anywhere, I would certainly want to go visit for six months or a year, not take a lot of money and not try to buy property right away,'' she added. ''You want make sure it's the kind of environment that is conducive to letting you do what you want to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring a bilingual person who can help you navigate the operational challenges you're likely to face is crucial for many expat small-business operators. ''Independence is hubris in a foreign country,'' Ms. Wynne said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learning proper etiquette for a business relationship is also important. In Mexico, for example, even a simple business call takes extra time. You need to ask about the other person's family, their day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even if you are fluent in the language, to understand even the first paragraph of a business contract, it's essential to have a legal adviser or skilled translator. And, of course, there's the challenge of operating in two currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to work abroad, the challenges are going to be exasperating, so don't just do it because you like it or you're good at it; do it because you really, really love it and enjoy every minute of doing it,'' Ms. Wynne counseled.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing numbers of people of retirement age or nearing it are remaking a hobby, interest or passion into a money-producing enterprise. That includes Carla Ingram of Sarona, Wis., who is using her expertise as a seamstress to develop a business in weather-resistant porch shades, and Donnetta Watson of Kansas City, Mo., who is turning her love of decorating and weddings into a wedding planning service and venue.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like many pursuing a ''second act'' enterprise, these older entrepreneurs don't have all the business tools they need. So they are tapping into a new joint effort by AARP and the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> to help people 50 and older learn about business plans, advertising and marketing, and social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two groups held an ''encore entrepreneur'' mentoring day last October and followed up with four weeks of outreach last month, offering 100 events around the country to link fledgling business owners with mentors and other resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research showing an uptick in such entrepreneurs prompted AARP to get involved so its members ''can pursue entrepreneurship as a means to generate income, boost financial security and assist others in meeting needs,'' said Jean C. Setzfand, AARP's vice president for financial security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent AARP survey, she said, found that nearly one-quarter of those self-employed, which comprise a large share of small businesses, are 60 years old and older. Another AARP survey found that 10 percent of wage earners planned to start a business after they retired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</span> has found retirement-age people starting businesses at the fastest clip of any age group. Its Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, released in April, found that the share of businesses started by entrepreneurs from the ages of 55 to 64 was 23 percent last year, up from 14 percent in 1996 and higher than the 20- to 34-year-old age group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ingram, 65, who sewed custom draperies while helping her husband run their small dairy farm, recently attended a mentoring event in Eau Claire, Wis., and spoke about the help she received from a retired patent lawyer when she was applying for a patent on her porch shade system. She also was looking for help to navigate the legal complexities of running her expanding business, Weather Queen Shades, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to make sure I have the right insurance, my trademark is protected and I know everything about writing up contracts,'' said Ms. Ingram.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is being paired with a mentor from Score, a nonprofit association that provides business counseling. More than 12,000 volunteers, many of them retired company executives, participate, offering free advice and guidance to start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People need to know how hard it is,'' Ms. Ingram said, explaining that she spent two years creating, then working out the kinks, in her shade operating system. ''What makes the difference is not being given money but the advice when you need it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kansas City, Ms. Watson last month attended a seminar on financial statements and borrowing as she learns to manage her business, which uses an event space called the Promise in the city's crossroads arts district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's totally different when you are trying to do this yourself,'' said Ms. Watson, 54. ''I have been learning about budgeting so I can bring aboard the people I need to help me run the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''The No. 1 rule is to do the bookkeeping every week, no matter what else is happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Watson has been working with a Score volunteer, Gary Brickman, a retired federal bank examiner. He said many aspiring small-business owners who turn to Score for start-up advice got cold feet once they learned of the financial commitments and requirements. But he said Ms. Watson ''has a business plan prepared and probably will meet her goals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question of whether to invest savings typically comes up during mentoring sessions that are either live or online, said Ms. Setzfand, and ''we always tell people that it is not a good idea to dip into retirement funds to fund any venture. We recommend setting aside a separate fund.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another stumbling block for retiree-entrepreneurs is the work-at-home swindle, she noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid such pitfalls, retired people, who are often starting their own venture after stepping away from a structured workplace, can pair up with experienced business people at the events for older entrepreneurs, said Michael Chodos, associate administrator for entrepreneurial development at the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>. ''Predators are circling around because that is where the deep pockets are,'' Ms. Setzfand said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The AARP</span>'s Fraud Fighter Call Center is receiving a rising number of complaint calls about self-employment frauds. The center fielded 150 such complaints from February to April, which was ''more than twice as many as we had at this time last year,'' said a center spokeswoman, Jean Mathisen.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very simple concept,'' said Daniel Miller, co-founder of Fundrise. ''You should be able to invest in your neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Miller, 25, and his brother Benjamin, 36, are the pioneers behind Fundrise, a Web platform that lets communities invest in local real estate projects. Sons of a prominent developer in the Washington area, the brothers began wondering a few years ago why people in a community, like the transitional H Street NE neighborhood, couldn't have more of a say in what was being built there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They realized that who the investors are and where the money comes from determine what gets built: distant private equity backers who see a deal as simply an investment vehicle tend to put up cookie-cutter projects and strip malls anchored by chain stores -- hardly what the community may want or need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who your money is affects what you build, but no one ever thinks about that,'' said Benjamin Miller, who also co-founded a site called Popularise that lets developers solicit input from the community. ''We're taking an institutional asset and changing who gets to invest in it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A faded two-story brick building on Washington's H Street seems an unlikely site for a revolution. But the unassuming structure -- at 906 H Street NE -- on Monday became the latest commercial development project to be open to public investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial stakes in the renovation project were offered to residents of Washington and Virginia on Fundrise.com. By Tuesday morning, investors had snapped up 1,500 shares priced at $100 a share. All told, 3,500 shares were offered to the public -- or 25 percent of the project cost (the rest was raised from private investors and West Mill Capital, the Millers' development firm).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cameron Cook, a 25-year-old project manager and Web developer who lives close to H Street NE, was among the first to invest, paying $1,000 for 10 shares. In addition to the potential financial gain -- an estimated 7 percent annual dividend from rental revenue plus appreciation in the property -- he was drawn to the novelty of the idea and the ability to directly take part in the neighborhood's revival. ''I think it's cool that the community can be more in control of what's happening around them,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seemingly simple idea is actually a radical departure from conventional practice, and requires some financial and regulatory gymnastics. Under current law, only wealthy ''accredited'' investors (typically those with a net worth of $1 million or more) are allowed to invest in private firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent changes to securities laws ushered in by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, signed into law in April 2012, will soon make it much easier for the Millers and other new-breed developers to ''crowdfund'' real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under that law, unaccredited investors may invest up to $2,000 a year, or 5 percent of their income or net worth (whichever is greater), in private firms, like a real estate limited liability company, as long as the investment takes place on a site or broker-dealer registered with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. The law, however, has been bogged down at the S.E.C., which missed an end-of-year deadline to complete rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, crowdfunding companies must either restrict investments to accredited investors or, as Fundrise has done, register each development project with the S.E.C. -- a process that can take months and tens of thousands of dollars. For now, says Benjamin Miller, offerings are being subsidized to prove the concept. But the brothers hope that eventually the process of offering shares to the public will become much easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of their first projects, 1351 H Street NE, a tear-down building in Washington's H Street Northeast neighborhood, will include a Taiwanese ramen restaurant run by a chef with a local following, food stalls and a retail shop -- an idiosyncratic project that would have been a hard sell for conventional investors. But scores of neighborhood residents were happy to invest an average of $2,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That first deal took three months to close. A subsequent offering -- for $320,000 worth of shares in 1539 Seventh Street NW, a 3,600-square-foot building in the Shaw neighborhood -- sold out in three hours. And the 906 H Street deal was on track to sell out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investing public will also benefit from appreciation of the property -- a new streetcar line that will run down H Street is expected to accelerate a revival already under way and bolster real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gina Schafer, the owner of several Ace hardware stores in the Washington area, invested in two Fundrise projects. ''I thought it was cool the minute I saw it,'' she said. ''We don't own our hardware store spaces, because real estate is so expensive here, but wish we could.'' The H Street projects are ''a way for us to get involved in the crazy D.C. real estate market and support our local community.'' She said that her first dividend payment was on its way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, the Miller brothers have been to New York, where they talked with local developers about using the Fundrise platform on community-scale projects in the $500,000 to $1 million range. They have been in touch with Jason Goodman, the chief executive of Third Ward, the co-working space that is building a 30,000 square-foot commercial kitchen and incubator in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, and Dan Biederman, the developer behind the Bryant Park revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their first New York partnership, they teamed up with Glauco Lolli-Ghetti, founder and principal of Urban Muse, to bid for rights to develop the John Street parcel on the northern edge of the Brooklyn Bridge Park development project. The site, a fenced-in lot adjacent to the Manhattan Bridge, is zoned for up to 130 residential units as well as ground-floor retail. Mr. Lolli-Ghetti envisions a 120,000-square foot building designed by <span class="companylink">Snohetta</span>, which created the Norwegian Opera House and the September 11 Memorial and Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the joint bid, Urban Muse would allow New Yorkers to invest up to $1 million in the retail component. ''Retail is such an amenity, I wanted it to be woven into the community,'' said Mr. Lolli-Ghetti, although he worries that city officials handling the request for proposals may consider public participation ''a gimmick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's not sure crowdfunding is suited to large, complex projects. ''In real estate, $10 million to $20 million projects are easy. But if you need $500,000 to buy a (small) property and put a local tenant on the street floor, you can't do it. It's too small for private equity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman of Third Ward, the co-working and educational space in Bushwick, is a long-term leaseholder who said owning the building through usual lending would require putting 50 percent down in cash -- or $7.5 million, an amount out of reach for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying it with the help of small investors is ''something we've started to explore again,'' he said. (Its Crown Heights commercial kitchen project opening next year is largely financed by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Third Ward mailing list of 80,000 people, 3,000 members, 15 investors and thousands of students who have taken classes there over the last six years could be a ready investor base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of them would be very interested in different ways of participating,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''This is game-changing for small businesses like ours but also for the neighborhood. It's bottom-up development instead of top-down, and that is totally unique. Nobody understands a neighborhood better than the people who live there or are stakeholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, it's like, why hasn't this already happened?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How does your background as a police officer help you as a C.E.O.?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. When you're a police officer and you walk into a situation, you're in charge. If you're not in charge, you're not going to live, or somebody's going to get hurt, or something is going to happen. You have to take control. You have to manage the situation instantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've got to assess the situation and make the right determination quickly. You learn how to read people instantly, figure out how to manage every aspect of the situation and prioritize. That's the best M.B.A. I think anybody could ever get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've done some undercover work, too, and I've done raids. The people going in with you need to trust you, and I need to trust them. That's one of the first things I learned. Who can you trust, and why can you trust them? Who's got my back? They don't have to like you, but if you're the person going through the door, that person needs to do what you say. They're going to respect you, because you don't have trust without respect. I would never exchange that life lesson for anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. After attending law school, you transitioned into business. Tell me about your leadership approach now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I firmly believe that the No. 1 job I have is to set the culture of the company. That's going to drive success. That's going to drive integrity. That's going to drive everything about the company. Early on, I started trying to think, how could I create that trust? I've got offices in 32 states, and I'm spread from Hawaii to Arkansas to Texas to Maine. Our all-employee calls are great, but I'm just a voice on a call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then a couple of things happened. One was I bought a motorcycle. It wasn't a midlife crisis. I have a brother who's three years older than me. Over a period of about three years, he had seven heart attacks. I walked into his hospital room after he was recovering from one of them and said, ''What do you want out of life?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I came back the next day and he said: ''I thought about that all night long. I want to get a motorcycle and ride Route 66.'' I said, ''Done.'' I bought the biggest one I could, a Harley Ultra Classic, law enforcement blue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around that time, we were organizing a big company conference with all of our general managers. So I had 200 employees in Oklahoma City for a marketing conference and I thought, I've got this brand new motorcycle. It's about a six-hour drive from our headquarters near Kansas City. I decided to ride the motorcycle to the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I pull up and I've got all my leathers on. I walk in carrying my helmet and everybody's dumbfounded. I became the buzz of the conference. The next thing I know, everybody's out looking at my bike. I had so many fingerprints on it because the employees were just swarming this bike. They thought it was the coolest thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started riding it to our offices in different states. I'd take everyone to dinner, and they would ask me why I bought the motorcycle, and then we would start talking casually about the company. I thought, ''Wow, this is a very comfortable, easy setting.'' I started getting phone calls from my general managers in different cities, saying: ''We want you to come visit us on the motorcycle. The employees think this is really cool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I came up with this concept of ''Ask the C.E.O.'' I would show up and tell the employees, ''Ask me anything you want to ask me.'' They were asking me all sorts of personal questions, and it kind of got everybody's guard down, so they felt more comfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had expected people to ask me about our five-year strategy. But I started getting questions like: ''Where did you go to school?'' ''Why did you get into law enforcement?'' ''Why did you leave law enforcement?'' ''How many kids do you have?'' I'm on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> a lot, too. So people would say: ''I see that you like to wear pink shirts when you play golf. Why?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would say, especially early on, 80 percent of the questions were personal and 20 percent were about business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why do you think that is?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They want to trust the leadership. They want to trust that you're making the right decisions. And it's not so much whether you're making the right decisions as far as strategy. It's more, can they trust you to come up with the strategy, and to make the right decisions when issues come before you? They want to know the person. They want to trust the person. That was interesting. That really did change my entire perspective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What is it about the motorcycle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They know I'm coming from corporate and I'm there to answer questions. When I show up on a motorcycle, a lot of it becomes about the trip, and there's just something about a motorcycle. There is a rebel aspect. And they can also track me because I have a GPS device on my bike. They know I'm riding to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they see me in a different light. They see me as human -- and not trying to be one of them, and not trying to be something I'm not. That is where I think most managers and leaders struggle. How do you get to the point where they perceive you as human? They want to understand how you think, how you tick. It goes back to the trust thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one thing I tell C.E.O.s when I meet them is, how do you know your employees trust you? Your employees have to trust you. I never ask them, ''Do they trust you?'' I'll say, ''How do you know?'' Because if you don't, you won't be successful. More times than not, they say, ''I don't know.'' It makes them think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want your employees to follow you, if you want the team to go the right way, they want to trust you're making the right decisions. But why do they trust you? Because of these visits on my motorcycle, I started to understand what was really going on. They want to understand my thought process, and they want to understand basically the core of who I am. That's why most of the questions are about my family and about my history.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cunningham, an ESPN sports analyst who has produced documentaries like ''Undefeated'' and ''The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters,'' on Sunday turned to the crowdfunding service Kickstarter. He is trying to raise money to finish what has been a nearly six-year labor of love: a film about the peregrinations of a severed leg that turned up in a smoker grill that was sold at a North Carolina storage unit auction in 2007.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who missed all the drama, the leg had been removed from one John Wood, who lost it in a 2004 plane crash and had been storing it, mummified, in the smoker. Shannon Whisnant, on finding the limb in his newly purchased grill, wanted to keep it, and maybe charge people for a look. Judge Greg Mathis, on his reality television show, gave Mr. Wood custody of the leg in November of 2007, but awarded Mr. Whisnant $5,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cunningham said he had since been trying to capture this bit of what he called ''true Americana'' on film, and, not incidentally, to learn ''what ultimately became of the leg.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking by telephone last week, Mr. Cunningham said the answer lay in spoiler territory. All will be revealed in a feature documentary, called ''Finders Keepers,'' that is being directed by Bryan Carberry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his Kickstarter campaign, Mr. Cunningham is seeking $80,000 to prepare the film for submission to festivals, including next year's Sundance Film Festival. If he can raise $307,000, said Mr. Cunningham, he will use it to finish a final version for commercial distribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the movie, he explained, is built around the interplay between Mr. Wood and Mr. Whisnant. But the underlying story, he said, also involves Mr. Wood's path to sobriety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This isn't a spoiler -- he's clean, and sober, and working in eastern North Carolina,'' Mr. Cunningham said of Mr. Wood.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDIn America's contentious tax reform debate, it is seen as C-Suite versus Main Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the United States are fighting for a cut in the official corporate tax rate, arguing that it is necessary to allow them to compete more effectively in the global market. But the nation's millions of small businesses fear they will be the ones paying for it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in favor of comprehensive tax reform that includes both corporate and personal tax, but we are not happy with anything that raises the rate for us,'' said Chris Whitcomb, the tax counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, the leading small business lobbying and advocacy group, representing about 350,000 members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conflict, which in some ways is even larger than the controversial issue of how to properly tax multinational corporations on their global profits, arises because the vast majority of American businesses, including some large, well-known companies and prominent Wall Street firms, actually do not pay corporate taxes at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in earnest in the 1980s, millions of businesses shed their traditional corporate status to become what are known as pass-through companies. That led to a boon for business, but was a drain on the Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what began as a typical Washington dispute between big and small business has been transformed into a fierce lobbying battle that pits some of the richest firms in the country against one another. Some big pass-throughs ''are trying to conflate themselves with smaller pass-throughs,'' said one official working on tax reform in Washington -- so much so that they could be accused of ''small business identity theft.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business executives have long complained that a traditional corporation's profits are taxed twice, first at the corporate level, and then again on the dividends received by shareholders. Pass-throughs, by contrast, are allowed to distribute their profits directly to their owners and investors, who then pay federal taxes on their personal income tax schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This arrangement, previously used almost exclusively by partnerships, very small businesses and the self-employed, proved especially attractive after the major 1986 tax overhaul, which cut personal rates below corporate ones. That spurred a vast migration to pass-through status, a shift that has continued up to the present day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 34 million business tax returns filed in 2009, the most recent data available, 32 million were pass-throughs, representing about 70 percent of net business income, compared with about one-quarter in 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most businesses are pass-throughs,'' said Eric Toder, institute fellow at the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> in Washington. ''They dominate the business landscape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that switched said the simpler, generally lower single-tax rules gave them a leg up and helped them grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGregor Metalworking Companies, a family-owned business in Ohio and South Carolina, had 80 employees when it converted in 1986 and now has a work force of 370.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been a real force for reinvestment,'' said Dan McGregor, 69, chairman of the company, which has seven shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the top personal income tax rate of 39.6 percent once again exceeds the maximum corporate rate of 35 percent, the pass-through arrangement remains attractive to companies like McGregor Metalworking, analysts say, by avoiding double taxation. And it is even more appealing to firms that are able to treat some of their income as long-term capital gains, which are taxed at no more than 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, the introduction of ''check the box'' tax return procedures sped the growth of pass-through businesses. Other rule changes, allowing companies with more shareholders to qualify and affording investors increased protection against personal liability for their business's debts, made pass-throughs even more popular -- and not only among smaller companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rules were originally written with small businesses in mind like restaurants, laundromats and small real estate developers,'' said Victor Fleischer, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. ''But the same rules are being used by some of the largest companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> estimated that the switch by corporations to pass-through status cost the federal government about $76 billion in tax revenue in 2007 alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crossing the line has been way too easy,'' said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the <span class="companylink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</span> in Washington. ''More and more these are very large companies, and they should be paying corporate taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, there were almost as many pass-throughs -- 15,360 -- with revenue exceeding $50 million annually as there were traditional corporations earning that amount. Among the big names escaping corporate taxes and paying taxes as pass-throughs is Bechtel, the global construction and engineering giant. A spokeswoman for Bechtel said it was a private company and would not comment on its tax status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies typically surrender their pass-through status when they go public, but some energy firms won an exemption. Kinder Morgan has organized its units as publicly traded partnerships, and investors pay taxes at individual rates, as do investors at <span class="companylink">Enbridge Energy Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some financial giants were also able to opt out when they became publicly traded partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>, the first hedge fund and private equity company to go public in the United States; Blackstone; the <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>; <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management</span>; and <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</span> all pay as pass-throughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Blackstone said it supported ''comprehensive tax reform that puts everything on the table including a possible tax increase'' as part of a broader tax package that manages, in its view, to simplify and improve the overall business tax landscape. The Private Equity Growth Capital Council, a lobbying group, said the spread of pass-through companies had created jobs and helped the economy, arguing that adding another layer of tax by treating them as corporations would run counter to bipartisan efforts to streamline the tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pay for a cut in corporate tax rates, some large corporations and the Obama administration propose eliminating some of the billions of dollars in tax deductions and credits that both corporations and pass-through businesses enjoy. The White House has also broached taxing some of the largest pass-through companies as corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Large companies are increasingly avoiding tax by organizing themselves as pass-through businesses'' an administration issue paper noted, putting traditional corporations at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, Timothy F. Geithner, who was the Treasury secretary, told the Senate Finance Committee: ''Congress has to revisit this basic question about whether it makes sense for us as a country to allow certain businesses to choose whether they are treated as corporations for tax purposes or not. It is not a fundamentally sustainable balance now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pass-throughs are fighting back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just want a level playing field,'' said Ron Travis, vice president for tax and legal affairs at O'Neal Industries, one of the largest metals distribution and manufacturing companies in the United States, with headquarters in Birmingham, Ala. O'Neal switched to pass-through status in 1987. It has a work force of 3,800, in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you do a corporate-only tax reform, we don't get a rate benefit,'' Mr. Travis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger pass-throughs have plenty of allies among the vast ranks of small businesses that lawmakers are particularly attuned to. ''We would lose critical deductions and benefits and gain nothing back by a lower corporate tax rate,'' said Forrest McConnell, whose father started his family-owned car dealership business in Montgomery, Ala., in 1919.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that alliance between the larger and smaller pass-throughs helps explain why any plan to cut corporate tax rates faces such tough sledding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of the reasons why it is going to be difficult,'' said Howard Gleckman, a fellow at the nonpartisan <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span> in Washington. ''As long as it is seen as raising taxes on America's yeomen business sector in order to cut taxes for Exxon, that is a really hard political sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 29, 2013, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the debate over corporate tax rates erroneously included one company among those that escaped corporate taxes by paying taxes as a pass-through company. The candy and food maker Mars does indeed pay corporate income taxes on its profits.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- One company threatened to sue 8,000 coffee shops, hotels and retailers for patent infringement because they had set up Wi-Fi networks for their customers. Another claimed that hundreds of small businesses were violating its patents by attaching a document scanner to an office computer system. One claimed rights to royalties from anyone producing a podcast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Obama administration is cracking down on what many call patent trolls, shell companies that exist merely for the purpose of asserting that they should be paid because they hold patents that are being infringed by some software or electronic process.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies exploded onto the technology scene in the last two years, accounting for more than half of the 4,000 patent infringement lawsuits filed in the United States last year, according to several studies, up from 45 percent the year before and from less than 30 percent in every prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That surge can be traced partly to the very law that was supposed to stamp out some of the trouble. The America Invents Act, signed in 2011, made it illegal to file a single lawsuit claiming a whole bunch of defendants had infringed a patent in the same way. Now, a patent holder must file individual lawsuits against each company, which has caused the number of lawsuits to soar, patent experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, President Obama took direct aim at the companies and their practices, announcing several executive orders ''to protect innovators from frivolous litigation'' by patent trolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama ordered the <span class="companylink">Patent and Trademark Office</span> to require companies to be more specific about exactly what their patent covers and how it is being infringed. The administration also told the patent office to tighten scrutiny of overly broad patent claims and said it would aim to curb patent-infringement lawsuits against consumers and small-business owners who are simply using off-the-shelf technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some big software companies, including <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, expressed dismay at some of the proposals, saying they could themselves stifle innovation. A trade group known as BSA: The Software Alliance, which represents software companies, urged caution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of the White House proposals are problematic,'' Matt Reid, senior vice president for external affairs for the group, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid said a proposal to expand the patent office's program allowing for special review of computer-related patents ''could inadvertently put at risk innovation for many industries that rely on software, from manufacturing to biotech.'' Changing measures that have been in effect for less than a year ''before we see the results doesn't make sense,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states have decided to act. Vermont passed a law last month that would allow companies singled out by patent-infringement lawsuits to sue their tormentors. Usually companies cannot fight back by countersuing because the patent trolls don't make anything that itself could violate a company's patents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vermont, companies that bring patent lawsuits and lose could be forced to pay the legal fees of the winning side and damages up to $150,000. Vermont has one of the highest per-capita rates of issued patents in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers encountered resistance in 2011 to some of the measures Mr. Obama ordered on Tuesday. The opposition came from, among others, pharmaceutical companies that feared that the legislation would hinder their ability to defend their own patents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and drafting a bill to address the patent troll issue, said at a panel discussion Tuesday that the opposition was stiff enough that ''it led a number of people to believe that it was going to delay overall patent reform.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodlatte said the jump in the number of lawsuits brought the issue back to the fore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arti K. Rai, a patent law professor at <span class="companylink">Duke University</span>, said in an interview that those numbers ''are a little bit manipulated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There probably would still be more lawsuits without the provision in the 2011 law that required a plaintiff to file separate lawsuits, said Ms. Rai, who in 2009-10 was the administrator for the Office of External Affairs at the patent office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she added, it was ironic that victims of patent infringement suits were asking for relief because of a law that was created to help them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> expressed wariness about some of the president's plans. Horacio Gutierrez, deputy general counsel at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, said in a blog post that the company was ''concerned and surprised'' that the proposal ''goes beyond patent assertion entities and instead targets software innovations more broadly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest companies that specializes in owning and protecting patents, said it believes the provisions requiring more disclosure on ownership of a patent are ''misguided and merit further discussion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and who was a primary sponsor of the 2011 law, said he backs the president's effort to suppress patent trolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The United States patent system is vital for our economic growth, job creation, and technological advance,'' Mr. Leahy said in a statement. ''Unfortunately, misuse of low-quality patents through patent trolling has tarnished the system's image.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others described the patent-assertion entities in less polite language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These guys are terrorists,'' said John Boswell, chief legal officer for SAS, a business software and services company, said at a panel discussion on Tuesday. SAS was cited in the White House report as an example of a company that has spent millions to defend itself against what it believes are frivolous lawsuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does not cost much to be a troll and to make broad, vague demands,'' Mr. Boswell said in the White House report. ''On the other hand, the risk to the company receiving a troll threat is enormous.''</p>

Mr. O'Keefe, 18, struggled with weight issues in middle and high school and felt compelled to speak out. He created a petition on the Web site Change.org, encouraging Mr. Jeffries to sell clothes to people of all sizes. That was on May 8; the petition has now attracted more than 75,000 signatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the people who heard about the petition was Greg Karber, a Los Angeles filmmaker. Five days after the petition went up, Mr. Karber posted a video about Mr. Jeffries' comments on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>. On May 15, a vague apology appeared on <span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span>'s <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page, and a week later, Mr. Jeffries met with Mr. O'Keefe. Afterward, the company issued a statement saying it would continue the dialogue and take ''concrete steps'' to support anti-bullying, diversity and inclusion.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is just the kind of thing Ben Rattray says he was hoping for when he started Change.org in 2007. The idea behind it began percolating when he was a senior at Stanford in the late 1990s, studying economics and intent on a career in investment banking. While he was home for winter break, his brother, Nick, who was in high school at the time, told his family and friends he was gay. ''Before he came out,'' Mr. Rattray said, ''Nick saw lots of homophobia and bullying, all these insulting comments made, but his friends didn't stand up for the L.G.B.T. community, no one spoke out. And it was so painful for him, seeing people he loved not saying anything against all this hate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a pivotal moment for Ben. That conversation began his transformation, he said, from wanting to be in finance to wanting a career that revolved around social change, ''enabling people to speak out for issues they care about.'' He thought he would do that by studying public interest law at <span class="companylink">New York University</span> -- and then he saw <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. ''I saw the potential power of that technology to connect people around issues of common interest,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rattray ditched law school and wrote a 90-page business plan for Change.org and then introduced the site with a college friend, Mark Dimas. They wanted it to provide tools for social organizing and fund-raising and tried a number of approaches, including virtual political action committees, skills-based volunteerism, social fundraising and personal pledges. It turned out the simplest tool, the petition, worked best. ''This merging of old-school advocacy with social media made the petition much more effective,'' Mr. Rattray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the company has 170 employees in 18 countries and is growing faster outside the United States than in it, with two million new international users each month. Last year, revenue was $15 million, which came from sponsored petitions, started and paid for by businesses and organizations. These are usually nonprofit, political and charitable organizations, although the site will accept sponsored petitions from any business or organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a month ago, the site made promoted petitions available to its users worldwide. Promoted petitions allow individuals to pay to get a petition in front of Change.org's 38 million users. The more a signer pays, the greater the number of users who will see the petition. For example, it costs $10 to promote a petition to 50 users, $100 for 500 users. The average contribution is about $19, and there is a $1,000 cap. Mr. Rattray projects that by year's end, 10 percent of Change.org's revenue will come from promoted petitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Change.org also secured a $15 million round of investment led by the philanthropic investment firm Omidyar Network. Mr. Rattray has declined to take traditional venture capital because there are few venture capitalists willing to accept his terms: he says he will never sell the company, go public or cede control. ''We aren't in the business of optimizing and maximizing profits,'' he said. ''We're in the business of impact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has been certified as a <span class="companylink">B Corporation</span> by the nonprofit B Lab, a certification available to for-profit companies that pass B Lab's B Impact Assessment, which shows a company meets certain standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. Mr. Rattray says he would ultimately like to incorporate as a benefit corporation, which is a legal status akin to a C corporation, S corporation or L.L.C. He can't do so because Change.org is incorporated in Delaware and that state has yet to pass legislation to allow companies to incorporate as benefit corporations. ''We operate as if we were incorporated that way anyway,'' Mr. Rattray said. ''We respect the interests not just of shareholders but of stakeholders too.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- A bold new billboard looms over U.S. 101, the highway that runs through the heart of the global technology industry. ''H-1b problems?'' it reads. ''Pivot to Canada.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sassy invitation is directed at the thousands of foreigners having trouble getting temporary visas, known as H-1b's, to work in the United States. Canada's new so-called start-up visa offers them the prospect of permanent residency and with it, the country's relatively low business taxes and public health insurance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is not alone in reaching out to foreign entrepreneurs. In a bid to create their own versions of Silicon Valley, Britain and Australia have dangled start-up visas like this too. Chile is even offering seed money to lure foreigners to come to Santiago and get their start-ups off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the seductions of this Silicon Valley are hard to resist for the men and women who dream of building the next <span class="companylink">Google</span> (or at least being the next <span class="companylink">Google</span> acquisition). This is where they want to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like being in Florence during the Renaissance,'' is how Xavier Lasa, a Spanish computer coder, put it recently. He sounded dead serious. He had come to Mountain View, just south of San Francisco, on a short-term business visa to join a technology incubator program called 500 Startups. He was building a tool for brands to advertise on the Web.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many foreign tech entrepreneurs angling to stay here, he had his eyes on Washington, not Ottawa. The landmark immigration bill that the full Senate is to take up next week includes a provision that Silicon Valley investors have pressed hard for: a new visa category for entrepreneurs who have persuaded American investors to back them with at least $100,000 in financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind that immigrants don't need special visas to be entrepreneurial; research shows that they are far more likely than native-born Americans to start businesses. Start-up visas are an easy political sell, which also explains Canada's latest gamble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Canada's immigration minister, Jason T. Kenney, came to visit 500 Startups recently, on a gloriously sunny Friday afternoon, he got a taste of what attracts foreigners. Dave McClure, a co-founder of the incubator, took him straight to the wall-to-wall 12th-floor window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is that way,'' Mr. McClure said, pointing to the 360-degree view. ''You can see Apple over there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's Sand Hill Road,'' he continued cheerfully, motioning toward the wide boulevard lined on both sides with big-name venture capital firms. ''Stanford is just up that way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The room was full of foreign entrepreneurs, huddled over laptops or sketching out business plans on whiteboards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julian Garcia, a programmer from Chile who was building a tool for marketers to target potential customers by location, explained his view of the Valley. ''Here, you build something incredible, in two years, you get acquired.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aditya Sahay, the founder of a men's fashion site, from India, retorted, ''Even if you build something not incredible, you still get acquired -- in four months!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kenney kept his game face on as Mr. McClure waxed about the attractions of the Valley. In an interview later, he said he was certain that some of the foreign entrepreneurs, uncertain about their immigration status in the United States, could be tempted by, say, Manitoba. He called them ''a captive audience,'' and said he hoped to take advantage of what could be a short window of opportunity for his country while Congress argues over how to fix its own immigration law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Canadian visa is not for tech entrepreneurs per se, but the venture capital requirements favor technology start-ups over more traditional immigrant businesses, like corner shops and restaurants. And the offer is far more generous than its American counterpart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone with one year of college and 75,000 Canadian dollars from an approved Canadian angel investor, or 200,000 Canadian dollars from an approved Canadian venture capitalist, can apply for the visa. Applicants need to be able to speak basic English or French. They need not prove they will create any jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kenney said he believed that investors, rather than workers in his ministry, were more capable of vetting who would be good for his country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The kind of rigorous assessment made by investors will ensure that the qualified applicants have really a high level of human capital and they are going to be able to move around the economy,'' the minister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked what happens if their businesses fail, he said he was confident that skilled, entrepreneurial foreigners would dust themselves off and find jobs in Canada's technology industry. ''It's a risk we're willing to take,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American lawmakers have opted for a more cautious approach. The proposed Senate bill would grant temporary visas valid for three years, unlike Canada, which would grant permanent residency. The Department of Homeland Security would have to report to Congress every three years on what kinds of businesses the recipients create, how many jobs they produce, and how much revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not geared toward entrepreneurs in any specific industry, though the rhetoric around it has centered mainly on technology. Technology investors, like Mr. McClure, have been actively pushing for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From a political perspective, the goal of the start-up visas is to demonstrate they're bringing in the sexiest, highest-value people,'' said Madeleine Sumption, assistant director for research at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, who has studied start-up visa programs worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she pointed out, most immigrant entrepreneurs -- <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s co-founder, Sergey Brin, included -- come in on other visas. ''You don't need an entrepreneur visa to have entrepreneurs,'' she added. ''You would have to let in a lot of people before you guarantee some Sergey Brins.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia offers its version of a green card to those who secure 1 million Australian dollars in financing from approved Australian venture capitalists. Britain offers temporary visas to those who procure £50,000 from a venture backer. Chile doles out $40,000 in equity-free seed capital to foreign visitors who want to start a technology business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayan Barua, from India, has already spent six months in Chile and taken advantage of its offer. Even though his girlfriend, who is Australian, has tried to persuade him to apply for her country's start-up visa, he has resisted. Instead, he and his business partner, Vamshi Mokshagundam, have returned to Silicon Valley repeatedly to develop their business, a recommendation engine for businesses shopping for software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their funders are here, they said, as are their initial customers. So too are other entrepreneurs whose guidance they seek. ''It's hard to find advice and mentorship anywhere else,'' Mr. Mokshagundam said. ''That's a big deal for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barua described California as the N.B.A. of the start-up world. ''The adrenaline rush you need as an entrepreneur is here,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the omnibus immigration bill winding its way through the Senate were to become law, he said, he would absolutely apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it did not, he and his partner said they might consider the Canadian visa. They would still want to come to Silicon Valley as often as possible. But they could use Canada as their base, as they use Bangalore, India, now. ''It would be a shorter flight,'' Mr. Mokshagundam said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a year ago, Congress passed legislation that its supporters said would help revive new company offerings. Now, the market for initial public offerings is starting to heati up, but the law, the Jump-Start Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, has had little to do with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You need only to look at the recent I.P.O. of the upscale grocer Fairway Group Holding Corporation. It's an illustration of the forces that drive the market for offerings and why the JOBS Act was a missed opportunity to truly spur more I.P.O.'s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in the 1930s, Fairway caters to Manhattanites -- and those who want to be like them -- offering lots of olives, cheese and other fine foods and produce. <span class="companylink">Sterling Investment Partners</span> acquired control of the company in 2007 and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the concept. Today, Fairway has 12 stores and wide eyes for a nationwide expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These plans were seeded with a successful I.P.O. in April that raised $158.8 million. More eye-popping than its expansion plans was the stratospheric valuation the stock market has given the chain. Fairway's stock price is up more than 60 percent since its I.P.O., giving the company a market capitalization of around $825 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do the math, each Fairway store is now valued at about $71 million. That's a lot of cheese and olives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairway is classified as an emerging growth company and therefore arguably benefited from the relief offered by the JOBS Act. But the question is, did its I.P.O. success have anything to do with the legislation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably not. In fact, the law may have even harmed investors in this case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand why, let's walk through what the JOBS Act did for Fairway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first thing is that the company was able to obtain confidential review of its I.P.O. documents with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. In the first year of the JOBS Act, this was one of the more attractive provisions of the legislation. A study by <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> found that 63 percent of emerging growth companies elected confidential review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like this provision because their numbers are reviewed and revised by the S.E.C. without the public's knowing the agency's focus. But this also puts investors in the dark about possible problems. We saw the value of this review in the offerings of <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> and Groupon, when aggressive accounting tactics exposed by an S.E.C. review alerted investors to problems at both companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another significant advantage provided to Fairway by the JOBS Act was the ability to avoid for up to five years making extensive disclosure on its executive compensation or holding a ''say on pay'' vote. Not surprisingly, this is popular among emerging growth companies. <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> counted that 82 percent of them took advantage of this provision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairway also took advantage of the law to avoid disclosing the full compensation of its executives, but it did disclose its full financial information. The JOBS Act allows companies to disclose only two years of financial information instead of three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, Fairway was again in the majority, as some 66 percent of the companies in the <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> study chose the same route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairway's selective use of the JOBS Act shows that it is being used to avoid disclosure of information that may cause embarrassment to the company or alert investors of problems. But at the same time, it shows that the law may have allowed companies to get away with not disclosing financial information that investors value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this has anything to do with whether Fairway would have gone public. Investors bought the offering because they viewed it as the next Whole Foods and not the next Pets.com. The fantastic pricing is a bet that the company will continue to expand. The JOBS Act had nothing to do with this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of an impact of the legislation is seen in the number of I.P.O.'s before and after its passage. Dealogic recorded an average of 33 I.P.O.'s per quarter in the year before the JOBS Act versus 31 I.P.O.'s per quarter in the year after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The act was intended to help spur a moribund market in small I.P.O.'s. But for offerings that raised less than $100 million, there were actually fewer after the JOBS Act. According to Dealogic, there were an average of 15 such I.P.O.'s per quarter in the year before the new law versus an average of 13 per quarter the year after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what does spur I.P.O.'s? Advantages that the Fairway offering had, like a robust stock market and a reviving economy in addition to a growth story that investors wanted to buy. Investors want to minimize risk and invest in the new thing, with economic factors dominating. This is why the United States I.P.O. market is down only 12 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a decline of 41 percent in the rest of the world, according to Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is a surprise to critics of the JOBS Act. The act was passed hastily, viewed as a cheap way for a Congress to be seen as doing something -- anything! -- on the economy. But the act's critics, including the S.E.C., opposed the legislation as deregulating public companies and perhaps encouraging fraud without doing much to spur I.P.O.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging by the companies that have used the act to hide things that might have raised uncomfortable questions, the critics have a point. The JOBs Act does make it easier for companies to go public in some ways, relaxing the prohibitions on analysts covering companies after an I.P.O., for example, but the law so far does not appear to be having its intended effect: creating jobs by spurring I.P.O.'s. This is not to say that the changes established by the law will not be of some use, because they got rid of needless regulation, but they aren't going to do much for the I.P.O. market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a shame because small I.P.O.'s have virtually disappeared. In 1997, 477 companies raised $100 million or less in an offering, for a total of $15.8 billion, according to Dealogic. In the year after the JOBS Act, only 53 small companies went public, raising $3.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We aren't even sure what caused the death of the small I.P.O. Some say it was decimalization, when share prices were no longer priced in fractions and brokers lost profits; others point to overregulation in the form of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. But neither argument seems compelling, because offerings fell off the cliff in 1997, before either of those events happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may instead be a result of larger structural shifts in the market and investors who are no longer willing to take the risk on smaller I.P.O.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress would have done better to have taken time to look at the market to see what was actually wrong. It may well be that in today's economy, this market cannot be revived. Or perhaps Congress should have allowed for the creation of a true small-issuer market like the Alternative Investment Market in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will not happen now. The passage of the JOBS Act sucked any remaining will out of Congress to legislate innovatively. The S.E.C. is engaged in a rear-guard action to minimize the harm from provisions in the act that it opposed, like crowdsourcing. As for Fairway, it would have gone public regardless, but did so without disclosing information that investors might value. It's too bad that Congress wasted a good crisis.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Stephen Glassman's idea for an art installation was an ambitious one: Transform a billboard above one of the busiest freeways in Los Angeles into a living bamboo forest, surrounded by a cloud of mist and augmented with air-quality monitors and Wi-Fi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding an appropriate site was only the beginning: Using the billboard required a permit, a crane to remove the existing commercial infrastructure, a welder, a plumber, a lawyer, a substantial amount of bamboo, water misters, technologists to set up monitors for air quality and Internet access. It would all come at a significant financial cost, and crucial pieces were missing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the hassles that come with large-scale and complex pieces, those like the one imagined by Mr. Glassman are increasingly in vogue because of their potential to draw people, said Samuel Scharf, an American installation artist. ''Nothing says 'come see our space' like an ambitious installation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But large installations can also serve a valuable role in promoting and drawing attention to smaller pieces, said the American artist Grayson Cox, whose installation with the title ''The Water's Fine'' transformed the entire gallery at Gasser &amp; Grunert in New York last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such complex and often massive works are not easy to deliver. ''Up and coming installation artists are increasingly interested in new technologies,'' explained Maurice Benayoun, a French artist and professor of creative media at the City University of Hong Kong. ''Their work can be very costly, and can require teams of people to assemble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Glassman, many installation artists are now turning to crowdfunding Web sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo to realize their ambitions. According to Kickstarter, 640 projects in the site's Public Art category, many of which are installation art, have been fully funded since 2009. In 2012 alone, the site financed more art projects than the <span class="companylink">National Endowment for the Arts</span> in Washington. Danae Ringelmann, a co-founder of Indiegogo, acknowledged that installation campaigns were showing strong growth, although the site does not release statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public nature of many installation projects makes them a natural fit for crowdfunding, Mr. Glassman said. ''I had a growing sense of urgency to create work that would be accessible to, and generate impact in the public realm,'' he said, ''and the democratic nature of crowdfunding made perfect sense.'' Mr. Glassman raised $100,772 on Kickstarter for his bamboo installation, called ''Urban Air.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with the spirit of crowdfunding, artists who have turned to the Internet for financing build in a range of rewards for their backers that is linked to the size of the donation. In some cases, the reward is a piece of the installation itself, an added benefit for the art form, whose bulky, site-specific or ephemeral works are notoriously difficult to sell or store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the American artist Molly Crabapple sought financing on Kickstarter for a live art installation, she eventually raised $25,805 from 745 backers. For her piece, titled ''Molly Crabapple's Week In Hell,'' the artist locked herself in a room for five days, covered the walls with paper and covered them in drawings, which she offered to those who had given her financial support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ari Fruchter organized a Kickstarter campaign for a work of Spencer Tunick, a project featuring 1,200 nude participants assembled and photographed at the Dead Sea in Israel. Good rewards were essential to the success of the campaign, which raised $116,270, Mr. Fruchter said. Donors who gave $5,000 to Mr. Spencer's campaign were given a limited edition photograph of the installation, which is now selling for more than $10,000, he said. ''There was a real return on their investment,'' Mr. Fruchter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other artists offer their backers the less tangible reward of being included in the installation itself. The American artist David Levine used Kickstarter to raise funds for his ''Habit'' installation in a New York warehouse that involved a 90-minute play, performed in a loop eight hours a day. Mr. Levine offered those who pledged $200 or more a chance to have their photographs framed and placed on set. For a pledge of $500 or more, the donor's name could be included in the play, spoken aloud for all to hear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapidly increasing use of new media by installation artists opens up possibilities for even more participatory rewards. As part of ''Molly Crabapple's Week In Hell,'' the artist created a live stream of her installation, which she made available to those who gave money to her project. She also let her backers send in e-mails with suggestions for her drawings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was definitely an interactive process,'' Ms. Crabapple said. ''By the last day of the installation I was so exhausted but I knew they were watching, and that was really encouraging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reactions to the increased role of crowdfunding in art installations are mixed. Mr. Cox, for one, is concerned that the practice will make the creation of installation art excessively commercial. ''There is something magical about opening yourself up to a community and creating a work through the generosity of different people,'' he said. ''But the spirit of an installation could be spoiled if the artist becomes too fixed on obtaining funds -- the intention behind the work could be commoditized or corrupted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others worry that crowdfunding relies too much on the ability to quickly attract public attention. ''I would consider the way crowdfunding depends on some form of notoriety or spectacle to be a disadvantage,'' said Ann Messner, an adjunct professor of fine arts at the Pratt Institute in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the shortcomings, crowdfunding campaigns are becoming an entrenched part of the world of installation art, and in art in general. For Chrissie Iles, a curator at the <span class="companylink">Whitney Museum of American Art</span> in New York, the trend could actually democratize the universe of installation art. ''It's crucial that smaller galleries, curators and artists have the capacity to be ambitious,'' she said. ''Crowdfunding could grant many artists a voice.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a dozen municipalities across the state have decided to enact moratoriums on retail marijuana sales, restricting them for now or at least until after the rules are finalized later this year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, unsettled at the prospect of dispensaries within their borders, have banned marijuana sales entirely -- which they are permitted to do under Amendment 64, the 2012 constitutional amendment passed by voters that legalized recreational use of the drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As we talked to our police department and our building code enforcement people, it didn't seem to be a very logical answer for us,'' said Mayor Tom Norton of Greeley, a conservative farm town north of Denver that banned marijuana sales outright this month. ''It seemed like it had the potential for creating more mischief than what we wanted to put up with.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discussions about how marijuana is to be regulated, and how the state will handle a legal drug market, played a central role during Colorado's 2013 legislative session. Meanwhile, communities from Littleton to Vail have taken it upon themselves to ponder the issue publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past six months, a task force of lawmakers, representatives of the state's growing marijuana industry and others have wrestled with developing the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial regulations, including licensing provisions -- described as ''emergency rules'' by the <span class="companylink">Colorado Department of Revenue</span> -- will go into effect on July 1. Permanent rules will be drafted later this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters will also consider proposed sales and excise taxes on marijuana on the ballot in November. The first license to sell marijuana in Colorado will not be issued until 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the meantime, local governments have until October to decide whether they will allow licensed marijuana businesses to start operating in their areas early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, reactions in Colorado's communities have varied according to whether their citizens supported Amendment 64.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, where residents overwhelmingly backed the measure and medical marijuana dispensaries line thoroughfares, city councilors have indicated their desire to move forward with marijuana sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller communities like Montrose, the seat of Montrose County, where most voters opposed legalization, have chosen to prohibit sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have opted for a middle ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City councilors here in Aurora, for example, voted last week to delay the date when residents could start applying for marijuana business licenses to next May, so that local officials could take more time to devise their own regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is another legislative session next year following the ballot issue this fall, which could change everything,'' Mayor Steve Hogan said. ''We're interested in the possibilities related to retail establishments. But we're not going to do anything until next spring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data compiled by the <span class="companylink">Colorado Municipal League</span>, nearly three dozen cities and towns have banned retail marijuana sales outright so far, while 25 have passed moratoriums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Christian Sederberg, a lawyer with the Amendment 64 campaign, pointed out that many local governments had taken no action and were planning to embrace the new law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he said he thought it was more prudent for officials to examine the regulations after they were codified before deciding on a full-scale ban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think opting out before you've seen the regulations on July 1 is premature,'' he said. ''A lot of these officials don't understand that there is nothing compelling them to act right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, after reviewing the final rules, a community opts out, ''then that's something people can live with,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in the state's second-largest city, Colorado Springs, will be weighing the issue at a meeting this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters in El Paso County, where the city is situated, were split down the middle on the question of legalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council president, Keith King, said he believed most residents were in favor of a moratorium on marijuana sales until the final rules and taxes were fully in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For us, we're making sure our approach doesn't hurt the military bases here and doesn't hurt the economy,'' Mr. King said. ''We'll be very deliberative on this and take our time, no matter which way we go.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- At the intersection of clean power and information technology, a new breed of digital start-ups is harnessing the power of the Internet to make smarter, more efficient use of energy and other resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents call it ''cleanweb,'' and they say the sector is poised to bring about huge leaps in efficiency, saving money and cutting planet-warming carbon emissions.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As its backers define it, cleanweb is any software or Internet application that makes it easier to use resources -- like textiles or cars or electricity -- more efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The label is applied to a diverse mix of companies, some of them far removed from the power sector. Cleanweb enthusiasts often point to <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, a Web site that connects people seeking vacation accommodation with others looking to rent out their homes, reducing the use of hotel rooms -- and, in theory, the number of hotels that need to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nest, a sleek, smart home thermostat that can be controlled from a mobile phone, is cleanweb, too. So is Mosaic, a crowdfunding platform that links individual investors to solar energy projects that reduce the use of fossil fuels. RidePal tallies online votes from commuters to design routes to work for employer-funded buses, taking cars off the road in the congested San Francisco Bay area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For me, it's about bringing the optimism and the creative energy of the Web to the big challenges of sustainability,'' said Jack Townsend, an organizer of Cleanweb U.K., a network of British entrepreneurs and technology experts. ''It's early days right now, but it's very fast-developing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the problems of sustainability are information problems, so information and information technology can be a big component of the solution,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors scared off by volatility and falling prices in more traditional areas of clean technology -- big wind farms or solar arrays that require hundreds of millions of dollars to get up and running -- are turning in growing numbers to cleanweb, where capital requirements can be lower and returns can come quicker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globally, investors put at least $1.2 billion into cleanweb ventures in 2011, according to research by Pure Energy Partners and the <span class="companylink">Cleantech Group</span>, a market research company. A quarter of clean technology deals had a cleanweb component that year, a 55 percent increase from 2009, said Nicholas Moore Eisenberger, the managing partner at Pure Energy Partners, a venture capital and strategy firm in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitch Lowe, the managing partner at Greenstart, a San Francisco venture capital and design company focused on cleanweb, said the number of start-ups in the area had doubled in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a lot of interest in this category right now,'' he said. ''The number of entrepreneurs who are starting businesses in this space has grown a lot in the last couple of years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth of cleanweb is another example of the huge change information technology has brought to so many sectors of the economy, Mr. Lowe said. This time, he says, it is energy's turn to be revolutionized by the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cleantech is moving from its first chapter, where it was all about wind farms and solar panels and these huge industrial things,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now that all that technology has been built, the question is how do you distribute it, how do you get it out to the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh out of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago's Booth School of Business</span>, Archie Gupta, an electrical engineer, saw a way to help independent energy generators operate more efficiently. Big utilities have smart systems guiding their decisions about how much power to produce and when, but in the United States alone, there are 24,000 smaller-scale businesses and institutions -- universities, hospitals, airports and factories -- that also generate power, mainly for their own use, Mr. Gupta said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because energy is not their main business, many have not bothered to install sophisticated systems to manage it, he said. Root3 Technologies, a start-up that he co-founded a year ago, offers software and services to do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the data is already there,'' he said. ''We are taking the data and converting it into actionable information -- and this is actionable information hour by hour. What do you need to do? What do you need to turn on? How much do you need to produce?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a significant bottom-line benefit,'' that helps clients cut their power generating costs by up to 30 percent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with leaders in the field like the entrepreneurs Sunil Paul and Blake Burris, Mr. Eisenberger, of Pure Energy Partners, recently helped to start the Global Cleanweb Initiative to promote the sector. In cities including Houston and Rome, the group has sponsored weekend meetings for programmers to brainstorm and build apps that save energy or other resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information technology can have a bigger impact on resource management ''than any hard technology in our lifetimes,'' Mr. Eisenberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to energy-related applications, the cleanweb world includes companies in what has been dubbed the ''sharing economy,'' connecting individuals who want to share baby clothes, appliances, cars and more. That saves money as well as the cloth, metal and other materials used in manufacturing such goods -- and the greenhouse gases their creation would have produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Steel, the co-director of the Cleantech to Market program at the Haas School of Business, at the University of California, Berkeley, said the popularity of cleanweb could lead to a glut of companies in the area, followed by a shakeout and consolidation. Yet even if that happens, he said, the sector looks likely to play an important complementary role, alongside more traditional renewable power companies, in helping to cut carbon emissions and conserve resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lowe, of Greenstart, said that venture capitalists who had lost money on clean energy investments in recent years might still be wary. But investors from outside the energy sector have been showing lots of interest, he said, looking at the new companies simply as strong start-ups with good prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenstart is investing in one new cleanweb company every four weeks. ''We're superbullish on it,'' he said: With a growing global population and tightening constraints on carbon emissions, ''it's just a massive financial opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eisenberger said he hoped the opportunities would draw even more entrepreneurs with big ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of thinking about making a billion dollars by creating some sort of photo-sharing program, which is great,'' he said, ''we would like that next generation of entrepreneurs to see how they can make a billion dollars using tech to tackle resource problems.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- THE Supreme Court's unanimous ruling last Thursday, barring patents on human genes, was a wise and balanced decision that clears away a major barrier to innovation in the areas of biotechnology, drug development and medical diagnostics. But the decision is just a first step toward finding the right balance between protecting legitimate intellectual property and securing an open future for personalized medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <span class="companylink">Association for Molecular Pathology</span> v. <span class="companylink">Myriad Genetics</span>, the court ruled that ''a naturally occurring segment'' of DNA -- genetic material that has been isolated from human chromosomes -- cannot be patented because it is simply a product of nature. For policy wonks, the case was a David-and-Goliath fight, one of the most important patent cases in a decade, with an outcome sure to affect the $100 billion biotechnology industry, no matter how it was decided.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the Supreme Court's ruling has been welcomed enthusiastically by many, the Myriad case has been only a modest victory for the advocates of genetic-data sharing. Indeed, none of the underlying tensions have truly been resolved: we still need to find a way for the biotech industry to keep a competitive advantage without endangering the welfare of patients and slowing medication innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, gene patents were only one part of the problem. A more vexing, and still pressing, issue is how companies withhold genetic data as a trade secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company at the heart of the case, <span class="companylink">Myriad Genetics</span>, was awarded two patents in the late 1990s for the human genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 and offered an exclusive test to detect inherited mutations in them; certain variations in a copy of either one can markedly increase a person's risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, nearly one million patients have taken the Myriad test and have had their genetic data compiled in the company's proprietary database. That, in turn, has helped provide the company with an extraordinary informational advantage when it comes to interpreting patients' test results. While Myriad has published some research based on its findings and says it plans ''to progressively release'' more, for the most part it has designated its trove of patient data as confidential business information: a trade secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Myriad was able to isolate the BRCA genes in the first place largely because it had access to government-financed public databases. But fairness aside, there are significant public health consequences when any one company gets to wall off such important human biological data from its competitors and, ultimately, from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That information, stripped of any patient-identifying data, could be a boon to cancer researchers as they try to design optimal treatments for breast and ovarian cancer patients, based on the individual genetic ''signatures'' of their tumors. Such a trove could help scientists better understand the cancer process itself. It seems crazy to keep that potentially lifesaving knowledge away from the broad cancer research community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before last week's Supreme Court decision, the importance of gene-related trade secrets, compared with that of outright patents, was clear. Myriad had already announced that it would begin, this fall, to replace its BRCA test with one that examines multiple genes implicated in hereditary cancers -- most of which were outside the scope of its gene patents before Thursday's ruling. The new test, likewise, is expected to use complex proprietary algorithms, developed from its prodigious patient data, and therefore be largely protected from competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the court's decision may prompt biotech companies to rely even more heavily on that strategy than they do now -- an unintended consequence that could stall research in many critical areas. Those with established beachheads on a gene-related disease or condition will be able to deter competition, much as they did before last Thursday's gene-patent ruling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, it will be patients and the public who pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We shouldn't wait as long to fix this problem as the Supreme Court waited to remedy its 1980 decision that enabled the patenting of human genes until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a first step, the <span class="companylink">United States Food and Drug Administration</span> should immediately investigate the impact of trade-secret protection on innovation in personalized medical treatments. The F.D.A. could also mandate public disclosure as a condition of market approval for genetic testing. Insurers too have some leverage: they could refuse reimbursements unless clinical data is shared for interpretation. But perhaps an even more effective remedy would be for scientific researchers themselves to get genetic information out into the public domain before any one company can call it a secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ad hoc efforts in this regard, including that by the Personal Genome Project at <span class="companylink">Harvard Medical School</span>, have already put an impressive amount of genetic and molecular information into open-access databases. But to make sure no company gets an exclusive hold on human genetic data, we need a data-disclosure effort that reaches critical mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 5, a consortium of 69 organizations in 13 countries made a great stride toward this end, agreeing to facilitate the sharing of DNA sequences and clinical information. But the effort still needs financing for researchers to work together on technical standards for sharing and interpreting genetic data. An annual public investment of just $1 million would be a start. Research funders like the <span class="companylink">National Institutes of Health</span> could induce more institutions to join by asking grantees to abide by standards set by the consortium.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brought together under the aegis of the Partnership for New York City, a group better known for supporting the city's major financial firms, the coalition, to be called GoBizNYC, will seek to amplify the voice of small businesses in the city's political process, said Stu Loeser, the group's spokesman and a former press secretary for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, which will include the chambers of commerce for each borough, will push for the formation of a small-business caucus in the City Council and will seek to become a source for elected officials and candidates on small business concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The formation of the group reflects a frustration among small-business owners that has become an issue in the mayoral campaign, where many candidates are pledging to address concerns about fines and regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One coalition member, John Park, a Korean immigrant who runs a business selling medical uniforms in Jackson Heights, Queens, said the number of fines issued by the city in recent years had skyrocketed. He said that the city was still the best place in the world to open a small business, but that there needed to be more dialogue between small-business owners and the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not crying, I'm happy, but still we need a voice,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another coalition member, Carol DiMarco, whose firm, Blue Label Design, is based on Staten Island, said the city's policies had hurt more often than they helped. She said she was motivated to join the coalition because she had watched many small businesses in the borough close during the economic downturn, and then after Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know a lot of my friends that are in the restaurant business have really been hit over the head with violations and little things,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosina Rubin, an owner of Attitude New York, a limousine service in Manhattan, said many small-business owners were concerned about a law passed recently by the Council that requires businesses over a certain size to provide paid sick leave. But she said she also had a more mundane concern: her drivers' getting traffic tickets when they were trying to pick up or drop off passengers.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roman Stanek and Robert J. Moore had the same dream. The two entrepreneurs saw businesses collecting lots of data about their customers' Web transactions and decided there could be a huge market in helping those businesses analyze the data to determine who their customers were and how best to reach them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Mr. Stanek and Mr. Moore went after roughly the same market at roughly the same time, they differed in one critical aspect: how they financed their dreams. One quickly raised more than $50 million, while the other mostly self-financed, thus creating a rare opportunity to assess the difference venture capital can make and bring new perspective to an age-old debate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Stanek, a Czech entrepreneur, founded GoodData in San Francisco in 2007, he already had plenty of experience with venture capital. He had sold a venture-backed software development tools company, NetBeans, to <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span> in 1999 for a little more than $10 million. And in 2006, he sold Systinet, a Web-service company, to <span class="companylink">Mercury Interactive</span> for $105 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After financing the first year of GoodData's software development with several hundred thousand dollars from his Systinet sale, Mr. Stanek began to seek investors. Eventually, he brought in $53.5 million from the likes of <span class="companylink">O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures</span> and Andreessen Horowitz. ''We spent three years building a product and we are still building big pieces. That was funded by the V.C.'s and myself,'' said Mr. Stanek, 47. ''It's like the printing business. I have to spend money on my printing machine. There's an initial large investment, and then once you have the printing press running, it's very predictable. So if we wanted to create a dominant large company, we didn't have a choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, before starting RJMetrics, the co-founders, Robert Moore and Jake Stein, worked as junior analysts at a New York venture capital firm, <span class="companylink">Insight Venture Partners</span>, where they came across entrepreneurs who had built profitable businesses without a lot of capital and put off fund-raising as long as possible. ''What happens in those situations is those entrepreneurs do extremely well personally,'' said Mr. Moore, 29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they started RJMetrics in late 2008, Mr. Moore and Mr. Stein invested $10,000 of their own money. Mr. Moore wrote the first version of the company's software in his attic in Collingswood, N.J. They did not hire their first employee until 2010, and they moved to an office in Philadelphia, where costs are far less than in New York or San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time they did raise some money, in early 2012, they had 100 customers and annual revenue of about $1 million. ''That put us in excellent negotiating position, because we had a proof point that other companies at our stage didn't have,'' Mr. Moore said. The owners raised $1.2 million, almost all from RJMetrics customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two approaches have created very different companies. RJMetrics signed its first paying customer to a rudimentary prototype just three months after it started. To build revenue, it had to hope for good word of mouth (which it got) because it did not have a sales staff. But bootstrapping, or self-financing, did allow the founders to keep a large percentage of the company's equity and to avoid the distortion that can come from having money and the demanding investors who supply it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture capital industry views bootstrapping in the face of a big market opportunity as false economy. John O'Farrell, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said that it generally took an investment of $75 million to take a software company from start-up to initial public offering. ''If you want to capture a big open market, you want to bring in money to grab land,'' he said. ''If you bootstrap, the tendency is to try to get profitable early so you don't need to put in more money, but you end up missing a big opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GoodData's war chest allowed Mr. Stanek to staff up for the land grab. The company now has about 250 employees, half dedicated to the product and half charged with sales and marketing. RJMetrics, on the other hand, has 26 employees, more than half of them working in product development and only four on sales and marketing. The company's first director of marketing started in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inevitably, the companies have gravitated toward different markets. While RJMetrics has gone after small and midsize companies, GoodData has pursued Fortune 2000 clients that demand robust products and have the money to pay for them. RJMetrics had about $1 million in revenue in 2011 and about $2 million in 2012, according to Mr. Moore. Mr. Stanek declined to specify his company's revenue, but he noted that last year GoodData signed 42 contracts that were each worth more than $100,000 a year, which would suggest an annual run rate of at least $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founders also see their customers differently. Mr. Stanek said that multiple customers had come to GoodData from RJMetrics because RJMetrics was too small. ''We have large customers who would not go to RJMetrics, who need 24/7 software, and special security, privacy and so on,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore, on the other hand, said his lack of financing allowed his company to pursue its vision without rushing after customers that did not fit. ''Our vision is that there is as large or more opportunity in the small-to-midsize market, and we have the flexibility to pursue that and be a disruptive player,'' he added, a luxury he said GoodData has not had. ''To scale the business, they have to make very big investments in getting very big contracts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the question is whether it is better to hold equity or trade it for growth. Mr. Moore noted that RJMetrics' founders and employees continued to hold more than 80 percent of the company even after taking seed financing. That meant, he said, that if RJMetrics were to sell for, say, $50 million, the founders would be set for life financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If GoodData were to sell for $50 million, it would be a disaster. ''The personal upside for someone who owns 5 percent of a company that sells for $100 million and the person who owns 50 percent of one that sells for $10 million is the same,'' Mr. Moore said. ''And a lot more companies sell for $10 million than for $100 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stanek said the higher expectations he faces were worth it because he and his investors expected the company to be worth at least $1 billion. ''I would not interpret it as pressure,'' he said. ''Life is short and we shouldn't waste it on opportunities that aren't worth it.'' He declined to say what percentage of the company he still owns: ''I am no longer the majority holder, but I have enough to keep me interested.'' Last week, his company announced that it had raised another $22 million in venture capital, bringing its total to $75.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. Stanek nor Mr. Moore sees this as a black-and-white issue. Mr. Stanek said he was a ''big believer'' in bootstrapping and that getting too much capital too early could be dangerous. And the RJMetrics founders recently decided that, after five years of bootstrapping, it was time to raise money to compete with GoodData and others. In May, they announced a $6.25 million investment led by a California venture firm, Trinity Ventures. ''The timing was right to put the pedal to the metal,'' Mr. Moore said. ''Whereas in the past we'd been growing at 100 percent a year, we see a path to substantially increasing that rate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Stanek, Mr. Moore declined to specify what percentage of the company the founders retained. ''It is an atypically large percentage compared to others in our position,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the key economic arguments underpinning the immigration overhaul is that immigrants create jobs -- not only because they spend money, but because they tend to be unusually entrepreneurial and innovative and so create job opportunities for the people around them. Think of Silicon Valley figures like Sergey Brin, Andrew Grove or Vinod Khosla -- or the designer Liz Claiborne. The bill that passed the Senate last week, under Subtitle H, even included special provisions for what is being called a ''start-up visa,'' to be granted to people who start companies that meet certain venture capital, hiring and revenue requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is it true that immigrants are unusually entrepreneurial? The data available suggest that yes, immigrants are overrepresented among America's business founders and innovators.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>-commissioned report in 2012 by Robert W. Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the business ownership rate is higher for immigrants than the native-born, with 10.5 percent of the immigrant work force owning a business compared with 9.3 percent of the native-born work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers refer to ownership of existing businesses; immigrants are also more likely to start a business in any given month. In 2010, the business formation rate per month among immigrants was 0.62 percent, meaning that of every 100,000 non-business-owning immigrants, 620 started a business each month. The comparable rate for nonimmigrants was 0.28 percent (or 280 out of every of 100,000 non-business-owning adults). The gap in new business formation between immigrants and nonimmigrants has been growing recently, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher business formation rates among the foreign-born may be driven by necessity, especially when the economy is bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of limited job opportunities in the Great Recession there appears to be an even greater response of starting businesses among immigrants than among nonimmigrants, which may have to do with lower-skilled workers having more difficulty in finding jobs,'' Mr. Fairlie writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrant-owned businesses tend to be smaller, with an average of $435,000 in annual sales and receipts, compared with $609,000 for native-owned companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for job creation, companies owned by immigrants are slightly more likely to hire employees than are non-immigrant-owned companies, though they tend to take on fewer employees on average in the cases when they do hire. Among immigrant-owned businesses with employees, there are an average of eight employees and an average payroll totaling $253,000. Native-owned firms that have employees hire an average of 11.9 staff members, with an average payroll of $429,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of companies that export their goods and services is also higher for immigrant-owned than for native-owned businesses (7.1 percent versus 4.4 percent). This might be because immigrants have existing business networks within their home countries, but it's hard to know from the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Immigrants' entrepreneurship rates are especially high in the engineering and technology sector. About a quarter of engineering and technology companies founded between 2006 and 2012 had at least one founder who was born abroad, according to a 2012 <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span> study. In Silicon Valley, the share was 43.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian-born immigrants are most highly represented among entrepreneurs in the engineering and technology sector; of all immigrant-founded companies in the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span> study, a third had Indian founders, up from 7 percent in 2005. The next most common nation of origin for these high-tech immigrant entrepreneurs was China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Kauffman follow-up paper also found that these high-tech immigrant founders were highly educated (74 percent held graduate or postgraduate degrees), and a majority had originally come to the United States to study, not specifically to found a new company or to accept a job at an existing company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A co-author of those papers, Vivek Wadhwa, has since written a book suggesting that we may be on the verge of a decline in high-tech immigrant entrepreneurship because of legal barriers to staying in the United States and improving economic opportunities back in immigrants' home countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from business start-up rates, another measurement that suggests immigrants are unusually innovative is the disproportionately high number of patents awarded to the foreign-born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2007 <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span> study found that foreign nationals residing in the United States were named as inventors or co-inventors on about a quarter of international patent applications filed from the United States in 2006. This figure probably understates immigrant patent filings, too, since it excludes immigrants who have already become naturalized citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A subsequent study on immigrant patent filings (conducted by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a nonprofit group of which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is a co-founder) likewise found that immigrants were named in more than three out of four patents at America's Top 10 research universities.</p>

Earnings at Toyota and Japan's other big manufacturers have already gotten a big boost from the tumbling currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tankan also showed improved sentiment in the service sector, with the index for big non-manufacturing companies rising 6 points to 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey ''showed a broad-based improvement of corporate sentiment from March to June, as widely expected,'' Masamichi Adachi, a Tokyo-based economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading fell short of Mr. Adachi's forecast of 9, however, thanks in part to cautiousness on the part of many manufacturers in assuming that the yen will remain weak in the longer run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyohei Morita, Japan economist for <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, wrote in a note that improved business sentiment was in line with expectations and set the stage for strong economic growth for Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We look for Japan to outpace its G7 peers'' in economic growth, he said, referring to the conference of seven industrialized nations. Last month, government figures showed that Japan's gross domestic product grew at a robust annualized pace of 4.1 percent in the first quarter, by far the fastest clip among the Group of 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are now watching to see whether the positive turn in mood at Japan's big companies will trickle down to Japan's consumers. On that front, the evidence is mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tankan measures sentiment by conducting a survey of Japan's largest companies and subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are negative from those who say they are positive.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2007, as a new paid sick leave law -- the first in the nation -- was about to take effect in San Francisco, Bill Stone was worried. Mr. Stone owns the Atlas Cafe in the city's Mission District, and the new law directed him to provide his 21 employees with one hour of paid time off for every 30 hours worked, up to nine days a year. ''Basically, it's just going to make it more expensive to operate your business,'' Mr. Stone told NPR at the time. ''Small business is going to have to pass that cost onto their customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years later, Mr. Stone admits to having been a little alarmist about paid sick leave. ''As a small restaurant business, it's really hard to make money, and when they add another requirement, it makes you nervous,'' Mr. Stone said in a recent interview. ''But all and all, I actually think it's a good thing.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, paid sick leave came up for vigorous debate in cities around the country. Portland, Ore., passed a law in March, and New York followed suit last week when the City Council overrode a veto by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In Philadelphia, sick-leave legislation died after Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed it. In each case, the same concerns about the bill -- that it is unnecessary and intrusive, and especially expensive and burdensome for small businesses -- have surfaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a contentious six-hour New York City Council meeting in March, representatives of at least a dozen trade associations testified against the bill. Jay Peltz, representing independent grocers, called it ''a de facto annual $800 million tax increase.'' Those arguments appeared to carry the day in the half-dozen states that have passed laws this year prohibiting cities and towns from enacting their own sick-leave laws. But in San Francisco, the District of Columbia and the state of Connecticut, places that have had such laws in force for more than a year (Seattle adopted one in September), it can be difficult to find small-business owners who say they have been hampered by the law's obligations -- though some object in principle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the statutes vary by jurisdiction, most require a company to provide an hour of paid time off for every 30 to 40 or so hours worked by full- and part-time employees. The laws make allowances for small businesses, setting varying accrual rates or limits on the amount of paid time earned or exempting the smallest businesses altogether. (In New York, initially, businesses with fewer than 20 employees will have to provide unpaid leave, not paid leave.) Companies that offer an equivalent benefit, including vacation days that can be used as emergency time off, do not have to change their policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the law took effect in San Francisco, nearly two-thirds of all businesses there already provided the equivalent of paid time off, according to a 2011 study for the Institute for Women's Policy Research, which supports paid sick leave and other family-friendly laws. ''I don't remember when we didn't have paid sick leave,'' said Paul Cowden, who employs four people at Cowden Automotive, a San Francisco car repair shop he started in 1978. ''To me, it's a humane way to run a business. And I give my guys their time if they don't use it. I figure I'm making deposits in my karma bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those companies that did have to put a new policy in place, about half reported that adopting and managing it was not difficult, according to the study. And many businesses fearful that paying for sick leave would drive up expenses have since reported that those concerns were unfounded. Richard Crain, who runs the Village Grill in San Francisco, said his nine employees were not sick that often. ''You have to give them one week per year,'' he said. ''But usually it's just a day or two here and there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stone agreed, and said that paid sick leave increased his payroll costs by less than 1 percent. ''In retrospect,'' he said, ''it really hasn't been a big expense at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not to say that no small businesses claim to have been affected by the law. Daniel Shackford, who operates Great Beginnings, a day care center in Plainville, Conn., said his payroll costs increased by $20,000 last year because of paid sick leave -- just over 2 percent. Under the new statewide law, which took effect early in 2012, when someone takes a day's leave, Mr. Shackford said, ''I now have to pay the temporary worker who comes in, as well as the person who's out sick. That either comes out of my pocket, or I have to charge my customers more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the law exempts smaller competitors as well as nonprofit organizations like the Y.M.C.A., said Mr. Shackford, who is a member of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, a trade group that fought the law, ''it's pretty hard to raise my prices to cover this expense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Businesses that are affected by the law don't like it,'' said Peter Gioia, a vice president and economist for the Connecticut trade group. Many companies already had their own version of a sick-time policy, he said. ''But this imposed a one-size-fits-all, union-type, strictly regulated set of procedures on everybody.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the number of businesses affected was limited in Connecticut, because the law was drawn narrowly. It applies only to companies with at least 50 workers, and manufacturers were excluded altogether. (New York City also exempted manufacturers.) Moreover, the Connecticut labor department has allowed business owners who have organized their ventures into individual legal entities to apply the 50-employee threshold to each entity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a restaurateur with six medium-size establishments might employ 200 or more people in total, but if each restaurant is established as its own business -- and this is common, according to Carmen Vacalebre, whose Carmen Anthony chain operates four restaurants in Connecticut -- the owner does not have to comply. Mr. Vacalebre said he provided sick leave only to his salaried employees. ''In the restaurant business, the hours are very flexible. If someone wants to trade hours, they do it every day,'' he said. ''My folks make a lot of money, but only when they work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials of the Connecticut trade group concede that, as written, the law applies to only about 8 percent of its members, and that many of these companies already have paid sick leave policies, or something similar, in place. Bob Davis, president and chief executive of Schulz Electric, a New Haven company that repairs industrial equipment, said he offered a generous vacation policy -- two weeks in the first year -- to attract talented workers. ''I belong to a number of different forums and industry groups,'' Mr. Davis said, ''and the way the law is written currently it doesn't affect any of the members.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, which mandated paid sick leave in 2008, companies with fewer than 25 workers need to provide only as many as three days of sick leave a year. A report released in June by the District of Columbia's auditor found that nearly 90 percent of responding businesses said the law would not encourage them to move out of the city. Nearly a third of the businesses, however, said they did not offer paid sick leave to their employees, in apparent violation of the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Damato, an owner of the popular Restaurant Nora -- in the '90s, the Clintons dined there frequently -- said he was not aware of the obligation until he heard about it from a reporter. ''It's never been an issue, because we just pay for it,'' Mr. Damato said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Racing to meet an October deadline, Obama administration officials said Thursday that they had awarded a contract worth as much as $1.2 billion to a British company to help them sift applications for health insurance and tax credits under the new health care law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, <span class="companylink">Serco</span>, has extensive experience as a government contractor with the Defense Department and intelligence agencies, and it also manages air traffic control towers in 11 states and reviews visa applications for the State Department. But it has little experience with the Department of Health and Human Services or the insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, where individuals and small businesses are supposed to be able to shop for insurance.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Serco</span> will help the Obama administration and states determine who is eligible for insurance subsidies, in the form of tax credits, and who might qualify for Medicaid. Tasks include ''intake, routing, review and troubleshooting of applications,'' according to the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a huge undertaking,'' said Alan Hill, a spokesman for Serco's American unit, in Reston, Va. ''We have some tight deadlines to meet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exchanges are supposed to be in operation in every state by Oct. 1. Under the contract, Mr. Hill said, <span class="companylink">Serco</span> and its subcontractors will immediately begin hiring 1,500 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the government first invited proposals, the importance of the exchanges has grown for several reasons. Many states have decided not to expand Medicaid, and the White House announced this week that it would delay, until 2015, a requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to employees. In addition, many states have decided not to set up exchanges, leaving the task to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several insurance and health policy experts said they were surprised at the selection of <span class="companylink">Serco</span> because it did not have experience with the exchanges. But that may have helped the company win the contract. In the last six months, federal health officials expressed concern that companies already working with exchanges could have an unfair competitive advantage because they had access to nonpublic information about how the government was setting up its eligibility and enrollment system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Serco</span> will also help the administration decide who is entitled to exemptions from the tax penalties that can be imposed on people who go without health insurance starting next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials say that in many cases federal and state computers will be able to verify a consumer's income and citizenship status and determine eligibility in a matter of minutes. But contract documents indicate that federal officials still expect that one-third of the 19 million applications in the first year will be filed on paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of <span class="companylink">Serco</span>'s biggest tasks will be to run a giant mail room, where it will receive paper applications, supporting documentation, and correspondence from individuals requesting coverage and from employers and employees seeking insurance. <span class="companylink">Serco</span> is supposed to make digital copies of the documents and then destroy most of the originals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the contract, the company is also supposed to help consumers and the Obama administration resolve ''complex eligibility issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contract documents say that <span class="companylink">Serco</span> must be ready for an increase in the volume of work, as some states planning to run their own exchanges may need extra help from the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said it could expand and extend the initial 12-month contract, bringing its potential value to $1.2 billion over five years. Mr. Hill said the contract could be ''one of the largest we've won'' in the United States, where <span class="companylink">Serco</span> has 8,000 employees and more than $1.2 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the Defense Department and other agencies face across-the-board budget cuts, the health law has been a boon to contractors. It would be virtually impossible for the administration to carry out the law without contractors to run a call center, a ''data services hub'' and a public-relations campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> found that the administration had spent $394 million on contracts to establish federal insurance exchanges. More than three-fourths of the money went to 10 companies. They include <span class="companylink">CGI Federal</span>, a subsidiary of a Canadian company, the CGI Group ($88 million); <span class="companylink">Quality Software Services Inc</span>. ($55 million); and Booz Allen Hamilton ($38 million).</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal regulators on Wednesday lifted an 80-year-old ban on advertising by hedge funds, buyout firms and start-up companies seeking capital, a move that will fundamentally change the way that many issuers raise money in the private marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> voted to approve a rule that Congress included in last year's Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, a law meant to help bolster small businesses and create jobs after the financial crisis.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move allows start-ups and small businesses to use advertising to raise money through private offerings. Hedge funds and buyout firms, whose investment vehicles fall under regulations for private offerings, will also be able to promote their products to the general public, though restrictions remain on who can invest in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some regulators, lawmakers and consumer protection groups faulted the S.E.C.'s decision. Luis A. Aguilar, the lone dissenter among the S.E.C.'s five commissioners, called the adoption of the rule reckless. He said it was being approved without appropriate investor safeguards and worried that it would lead to abuse. ''The record is clear that general solicitation will make fraud easier by allowing fraudsters to cast a wider net for victims,'' Mr. Aguilar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Carl M. Levin, the Michigan Democrat who has pushed for greater regulation of Wall Street, criticized the rule and the S.E.C.'s new chairwoman, Mary Jo White. ''Proceeding today with this flawed rule will ultimately damage the investing public and investor confidence in U.S. markets,'' Mr. Levin said in a statement. ''I am disappointed that Mary Jo White, who knows what it's like to combat financial fraud, let this rule go with so few investor protections.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of the rule argue that there still are substantial limits on who can invest in these private offerings. Those who qualify -- called ''accredited investors'' -- must have a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or annual income of more than $200,000 in each of the previous two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, opponents contend that there are lax safeguards for verifying that investors are accredited. The regulation dictates that the company or fund raising money have a reasonable basis to conclude that the investor is qualified and includes various verification methods, including reviewing tax returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several state securities regulators also denounced the rule. The Arkansas securities commissioner, A. Heath Abshure, said that the S.E.C., in allowing small, speculative companies and high-risk hedge funds to raise money through public advertising, had failed to ensure the integrity of the market. ''You can't just open the door of a new way of offering securities without ensuring the integrity of the market,'' Mr. Abshure said. ''And the idea that the accredited investor is a sophisticated investor is ridiculous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of its effort to guard against potential abuse, the S.E.C. also voted on Wednesday to bar felons and other ''bad actors'' convicted of securities fraud from raising money through private offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of the rule said that it helps bring securities regulations in line with modern financial markets. The advertising ban on private offerings was adopted in 1933 as part of a series of investor protection laws enacted during the Great Depression. Today, hedge funds, private equity and private offerings, once exclusively the domain of large pension funds and wealthy families, have become far more accessible and visible to the investing public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a larger and deeper investor base, a bigger and more diverse pool of issuers, and a proliferation of technologies that allow information to be conveyed across the globe nearly instantaneously,'' said Matthew E. Kaplan, a partner at the law firm <span class="companylink">Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</span>. ''Those factors underpinned the general consensus that it was time to consider updating rules that many viewed as being a bit long in the tooth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge fund managers were once small, niche players in the financial markets and rarely sought publicity. Today, many of them grant interview requests, make frequent television appearances and lecture at conferences. Some large ones, like Och-Ziff Capital Management, are publicly traded companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, several of the world's largest private equity firms, including the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</span>, are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Even investing in privately held companies has become more accessible to the public. In recent years, so-called secondary exchanges like SecondMarket have developed on which trading in private companies takes place. And small companies are looking to raise money through social media and other technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though they get far less publicity than splashy initial public offerings, private placements play a prominent role in the financial markets. The amount of money raised through private offerings in 2011 was about $900 billion, compared with about $1.2 trillion in public stock offerings and debt deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ban on advertising will officially end some time later this year, after a 60-day waiting period. The rule will require hedge funds and companies that use general advertising to notify the S.E.C. 15 days before the solicitation begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most hedge fund and private equity lawyers said that they did not expect the airwaves to be filled with hedge fund ads promoting their superior risk-adjusted returns. Because only about 7 percent -- or 7.6 million households -- are accredited investors, mass advertising through television or magazines makes little economic sense for most funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's likely that the new rules will take some time to pick up much momentum, and that there will only be a handful of pioneer-types at first who will look to dip their toes in the advertising waters,'' said Steven B. Nadel, a lawyer at Seward &amp; Kissel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elisse B. Walter, an S.E.C. commissioner who voted to eliminate the advertising ban, noted that the agency must continue to be vigilant in monitoring whether the looser regulations and increased advertising put investors at greater risk.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATHENS -- As Greek lawmakers prepared to vote on a package of new austerity measures, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said Wednesday that the country's lenders had agreed to a major concession, a sharp reduction in the sales tax on restaurant meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting on Aug. 1, the tax will drop to 13 percent from the current 23 percent, a move devised to aid small businesses and bolster the crucial tourism sector.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the first time, we are not just averting something unpleasant, but we are bringing positive change,'' Mr. Samaras said in a televised address. He noted that government officials had also dissuaded Greece's lenders from imposing new cuts to pensions and a tax on the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, euro zone finance ministers approved 6.8 billion euros, or $8.9 billion, in rescue loans, to be disbursed in installments. But the payouts are subject to the Greek government's honoring its commitments to the so-called troika of lenders, the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>, the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> and the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extent of the austerity measures, which Greek lawmakers are set to vote on early Thursday, has been a point of contention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Samaras has long lobbied for the lowering of the value-added tax on restaurants and taverns. Government officials had insisted that a cut in the V.A.T. would increase revenue, not reduce it, as well as curb tax evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't believe it yet,'' Mr. Samaras said, referring to the troika. ''But they agreed to try reducing taxes for the first time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European Commission spokesman said the reduction would be made on a trial basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A reduction in the V.A.T. rate for the restaurant sector would be possible without running any budgetary risks, so long as it was just a temporary measure,'' the spokesman, Simon O'Connor, said in Brussels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative drew a caustic response from the main political opposition, the leftist party Syriza, which accused Mr. Samaras of ''cynicism and hypocrisy'' for announcing the tax cut a few hours before a parliamentary vote on new austerity measures that calls for thousands of layoffs and wage cuts in the Civil Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The delayed and temporary reduction on V.A.T. in the food service sector is a drop in the ocean of the catastrophic policies of the memorandum,'' the party said in a statement, referring to Greece's bailout deal with the troika.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the objections of Syriza and other opposition parties, as well as some lawmakers from the governing coalition, the legislation is expected to be approved by the 300-seat Parliament, where the government has a slim majority of 5. A vote was to begin at midnight on Wednesday after two days of debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the volatile political climate, Mr. Samaras will have a tough time enforcing the new reforms, particularly layoffs of civil servants, who have remained relatively unscathed during four years of austerity that have crippled the Greek private sector, pushing unemployment above 27 percent. In a bid to appease the local authorities, the government late Tuesday withdrew an article in the bill that would have imposed disciplinary action on mayors found to exceed their budgets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like designers and artists all over the world, the occupants of Space's studios are eager to experiment with the latest advances in 3D printing and other digital production technologies, which promise to transform the way their work is made, what it looks like and how it will be used. Fab Lab is intended to give them the physical resources to do so, while Space plans to organize debates where they can discuss the possibilities of these new forms of manufacturing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Translating scientific innovations into things that may make our lives more efficient, enlightened or enjoyable has been an important role of design throughout history; sometimes of art too. Experimenting with the rapidly evolving technology of digital manufacturing forms part of that tradition, which is why it has proved so contentious within design circles. Some see it as a transformational technology akin to the printing press and steam engine, while others dismiss such claims as wildly exaggerated, making it timely to assess what impact 3D printing has made on design so far, and how will it develop in future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology of 3D printing, a process of additive manufacturing in which solid objects are constructed from fine layers of specially formulated material, dates to the 1980s, when it was invented by an American technologist Charles (Chuck) Hull, who founded the company 3D Systems. Similar processes were deployed to produce complex objects, like the components of aircraft or Formula One cars, which were valuable enough to justify the use of such sophisticated technology and typically made as one-offs or in limited numbers. The process is so fast that each object is made individually, and can therefore be customized to suit the user.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the technology has become more efficient and less expensive, 3D printing has expanded into new fields, including the production of medical devices. Some of the companies that apply it on an industrial scale, including CRP Group in Italy and Materialise in Belgium, have collaborated with designers to experiment with ways of using their systems to make furniture and other small objects in far larger quantities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, desktop 3D printers have been developed by companies like 3D Systems and MakerBot in New York, which can be used by consumers with no experience of programming and cost not much more than a decent desktop computer. These printers are so small -- the two CubeX machines made by 3D Systems that Space hopes to buy can not manufacture anything bigger than a basketball -- they are mostly used to produce knickknacks like phone cases and jewelry, yet they are proving increasingly popular, particularly with designers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt that the cost of both industrial and consumer 3D printers will continue to fall. The machines will also become more efficient, in terms of speed, precision and versatility. Those innovations will be accompanied by similarly striking improvements in the range and quality of the materials suitable for use in 3D printing, thereby enhancing its creative possibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of my favorite examples of 3D printing so far is Collagene, a series of bespoke masks developed by Filippo Nassetti and Alessandro Zomparelli, two young Italian designers who work together as Do the Mutation. They have designed software to create individual masks based on scans of human faces made by games console sensors. The masks are 3D printed by CRP in Windform, a polyamide-based material, in the shape of eerily surreal tangles of ''twigs,'' which are so intricate that they have the futuristic air of things that could only have been made by advanced technology, and look significantly different to the products of traditional mass-manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same structurally complex, otherworldly aesthetic will become increasingly familiar as designers take advantage of developments in digital production to realize hitherto unattainable shapes in complex geometries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another change is that rather than expecting to control the final form of their work, designers will have to devise ways of enabling other people to personalize it, both for stylistic and functional reasons. Amputees will eventually use 3D printing to make artificial limbs that fit perfectly, and people with arthritis may benefit from adjusting the handles of cooking utensils to make them easier to grip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well as creating new products, 3D printing will be used to produce accurate replicas of the lost or damaged components of existing ones. Designers will need to allow for the possibility of replacing individual parts when devising the original objects. Another challenge will be to design new business models to tap into the growing popularity of repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only does digital production promise to transform the relationship of designers with the people who use their work, it will do the same to their rapport with manufacturers. Eventually, there could be a sophisticated 3D printing facility in every village and town, where local people can source customized products or repair existing ones, as their ancestors did at nearby blacksmith's forges. Doubtless, tech savvy entrepreneurs are already planning to open them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this scenario, designers will be less dependent on finding manufacturers that are willing to realize their ideas; they will be able to produce their own prototypes and to become increasingly entrepreneurial in selling their work directly to consumers. ''Design Beyond Production,'' an exhibition running through Aug. 18 at the Z33 design center in the Belgian city of Hasselt, is exploring that phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that 3D printing is the only dazzling technology for designers to wrestle with, because 4D technology is on its way, thanks to scientists at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who are experimenting with new materials that can adapt their shape and other qualities to suit their surroundings. Will 5D be next?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's an unfortunate fact: the people who are most in need of honest financial advice often cannot afford it, or they don't realize that their so-called adviser isn't an adviser at all, but a salesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Alexa von Tobel has her way, however, financial advice will be as widely available -- and affordable -- as any other mass-produced consumer product or service. Think gym memberships. It will become the perfect wedding gift for your best friend, or for adult children after they have their first baby.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the founder of LearnVest, an online financial advisory that she started four years ago, Ms. von Tobel, 29, repeats these themes several times over the course of a recent meeting to underscore what she has set out to do: deliver comprehensive and conflict-free financial advice to the middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Financial advice shouldn't be a luxury,'' said Ms. von Tobel, a petite blonde with a big personality, in the company's loftlike offices in New York. ''We want to disrupt the industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If her plan works, she would be among the first to crack the code, using both technology and bona fide certified financial planners -- the gold standard among advisers -- to make this sort of help more accessible to millions of Americans. Most individuals do not have terribly complex financial lives, nor should they need to spend several thousands of dollars to get the advice they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for LearnVest to succeed, Ms. von Tobel will need to sell its product -- one that, let's face it, feels a little like eating your vegetables -- to a vast number of customers across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LearnVest, which started in 2009 as a budgeting Web site directed at women, just received another large round of financing from big-time investors, which will allow it to hire more planners and support staff as well as open a training and adviser hub in Phoenix. The company raised $16.5 million, which comes on top of the nearly $25 million raised since its inception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to beef up its operation so it can handle the big distribution partnerships that are in the works, including a potential deal with <span class="companylink">American Express</span>, one of its new investors. The company has broad plans to provide its newly designed product: a seven-step, customized financial plan. Ms. von Tobel, who dropped out of Harvard Business School to start the company, also said it was working with employers and financial planning firms to sell its program within 401(k)'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most financial planners focus on wealthier people, whom they can charge $1,000 to $3,000 for a financial plan, or collect 1 percent of their assets, on average, to manage their money. In contrast, LearnVest charges a $399 upfront fee and $19 a month, or $608 annually. You can pay less for help on a specific goal, like paying off debt or starting a budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. von Tobel, who is represented by <span class="companylink">William Morris Endeavor</span>, the talent agency, has worked hard to raise the company's profile -- as well as her own -- in the world of personal finance, though she has not yet reached Suze Orman status. A book by Ms. von Tobel will be released in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, her company does not have much direct competition, aside from the smattering of unbiased advisers that charge a flat or hourly fee. Several relatively affordable online financial firms have cropped up in recent years -- including Betterment, Wealthfront, Flat Fee Portfolios and FutureAdvisor -- but their focus is much narrower. These companies help assemble and manage low-cost investment portfolios. But they won't determine how much you can afford to spend on a mortgage, what sort of life insurance you should buy and whether you should be saving more for a child's college tuition or your own retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal Capital, an online wealth management firm, also combines real advisers with technology, but it, too, focuses on money management and requires a minimum investment of $100,000. NestWise, a unit of LPL Financial, opened last September and probably comes closest to competing directly with LearnVest. It has 23 advisers who use technology to connect with its clients, but not all are certified financial planners. Its most expensive service costs about $825 for the first year and $575 annually thereafter, though it will manage your money for about 1 percent of your assets, in addition to the cost of the underlying investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what do you get at LearnVest for $19 a month? Since the company became a registered investment adviser last year, it can now offer investment advice. Ms. von Tobel says she is ripping a page from Weight Watchers' playbook with the most recent version of its service: a seven-step action plan, which begins with a diagnostic call that typically lasts 45 to 90 minutes. ''You can be someone who is extremely sophisticated with millions of dollars or a doctor with $200,000 in debt,'' said Ms. von Tobel, who became a financial adviser earlier this year. ''But you should still go through this process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(So far, most customers are college-educated people between 25 and 55 with incomes of $70,000 or more.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advisers save time by leaning heavily on the company's technology: a planner could see where you overspent on dinner the night before by viewing your online profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients connect all their accounts to LearnVest's online ''money center.'' This captures every last financial transaction across your accounts, like checking, savings, credit cards and investments. Your adviser uses all this data, combined with a financial questionnaire and the information gathered on the call, to tailor a plan. You can both view your personal ''money center,'' which is a cross between an e-mail in-box and a giant checking register, while on the phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In about 10 days, you receive a customized financial plan. The sample I reviewed was about 77 pages, with a section dedicated to each of its seven steps -- which include ''organizing'' and ''building'' -- that cover all aspects of your financial life. The plan provided specifics on how to get out of debt, set up a college savings plan for a child, and how much to save for retirement, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are assigned a financial planner, and, at least for now, the cost includes unlimited phone and e-mail chats. ''When I say unlimited, I mean unlimited,'' Ms. von Tobel said. To make sure you follow through, the financial planner e-mails what the company calls bite-size challenges -- say, to buy life insurance or increase your 401(k) savings by 1 percent -- with a deadline. ''When you miss a deadline, the planner is also notified and can nudge you to help hold you accountable,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the service stops short of making specific mutual fund recommendations, but instead tells you how much money to put in each type of investment, like large-capitalization stocks and bonds. It also included a list of ''vetted providers,'' like <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span>, Fidelity, <span class="companylink">TD Ameritrade</span> and Vanguard, and detailed information about their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time will tell whether the planners, all salaried employees who receive bonuses based on customer satisfaction, can handle the number of clients required of them. LearnVest currently has about 25 certified planners in 10 states and five time zones, with plans to expand to about 35 by the end of the year. Ms. von Tobel declined to say how many customers the advisers, most of whom work from home, would ideally handle at full throttle. NestWise's chief executive said the goal was for each of its advisers to oversee 500 clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former LearnVest employees told me that some people left the company because they were overworked, but those were also relatively early days at a start-up. It's also possible that LearnVest will be owned by someone else a few years from now, since many entrepreneurs with big investors are building companies to sell them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Ms. von Tobel said she was focused on getting the program, which holds great potential to revolutionize financial planning for the masses, in as many hands as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no reason this can't be enormous,'' Ms. von Tobel said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sense, much of Internet commerce is largely a matchmaking service, connecting people looking for relationships, taxis or spare bedrooms. One of the hottest areas is the market for personal loans, which is attracting money from venture capital investors, spurred by the fast growth of the largest online platform, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, and the paper profits for its early backers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their simplest form, these marketplaces link borrowers who want to refinance high-interest credit card debt of 20 percent or more with investors looking to beat paltry bank savings account yields of less than 1 percent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, borrowers obtain three- or five-year personal loans and pay annual interest of about 14.5 percent, depending on their credit scores, which can lift it to as much as 30 percent, with fees. Investors can earn interest rates of about 8.5 percent, the company says. The difference from the average comes from defaults, which cut annual returns by 3.5 percent, and the company's annual fees of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s earliest investors, including Norwest Venture Partners, <span class="companylink">Canaan Partners</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgenthaler Ventures</span>, are showing paper profits of more than 10 times their investment, based on <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s most recent valuation of $1.55 billion in an investment led by <span class="companylink">Google</span> in May. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> hopes to complete an initial public offering next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That success has drawn the interest of venture capital firms looking for similar results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investing in the networks that light up the sharing economy'' for items like rooms and rides ''certainly looks like a good idea,'' Fred Wilson, a managing partner of <span class="companylink">Union Square Ventures</span>, said in a post on his Web site in July. Union Square invested in <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> in 2011 and has put money into multiple platforms. Last year, it backed Funding Circle, which offers small business loans in Britain. This year, it financed the personal-loan marketplace Auxmoney in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a platform proliferation out there,'' said Frank Rotman of QED Investors, a group of former executives of <span class="companylink">Capital One Financial</span> that has invested in four platforms. ''Usually that happens when you see one company succeed and people say they want to find the next one. Right now, everyone is trying to find the next <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>. They don't want to feel like they missed the opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of significant lending platforms has already grown to roughly 50 worldwide, according to Disruption Credit, an investment firm. The main personal loan platforms in the United States are <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper Marketplace. On Deck and Kabbage offer small-business lending. Overseas, Zopa and RateSetter offer consumer lending in Britain, as does SocietyOne in Australia. And student-financing platforms include Social Finance, CommonBond, Pave and Upstart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disruption Credit's chief executive, Michael Parekh, says such platforms can disrupt Wall Street and traditional banks much like <span class="companylink">Google</span> has taken on old-style media companies and <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> has taken business from brick-and-mortar retailers. Disruption and other experts cite a vast $2.8 trillion consumer credit market up for grabs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, which just passed the $2 billion mark in total loans made, already has plans to expand into small-business and student loans, and may pursue credit cards, insurance and mortgages. It may also expand globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its original base of individual investors, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> has attracted the participation of a few community banks as well as institutional funds that invest in the loans. It also attracted a later-stage investment in 2012, at about one-third the current value, from the venture firm <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, which has a partner, Mary Meeker, on <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s board. Other directors include John J. Mack, a former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, and Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary. Kleiner's China fund is also backing CreditEase, an online small-business and consumer lender in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> can complete an I.P.O. on schedule next year, ''I believe this will be the financial-tech version of the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> I.P.O., a coming-of-age event just like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was for social media,'' said Dan Ciporin, general partner of <span class="companylink">Canaan Partners</span>, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s second-largest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> expects revenue could roughly triple, to $100 million in 2013 from $36 million in 2012, and could grow to $400 million by 2015. One Wall Street banker said other fast-growing online services like LinkedIn and <span class="companylink">Priceline.com</span> traded at 7 to 10 times revenue expected for the following year. At that rate, he says, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> could be worth more than $3 billion in an I.P.O. next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this is viewed by venture capitalists as incredibly disruptive and rapidly scalable,'' said Ron Suber, head of institutional sales at Prosper Marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Grady, a partner at Prosper's chief venture backer, Sequoia Capital, said big banks might be hobbled by their ''legacy infrastructure'' and ''incumbent inertia.'' He added, ''In some ways, the sky's the limit. There's nothing that says the banks of yesteryear have to be the banks of tomorrow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a presentation in June at the inaugural Lendit conference for the nascent sector in New York, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s founder and chief executive, Renaud Laplanche, compared its rapid embrace by customers to the adoption of electricity, color television, stoves and washing machines, saying he plans to ''transform the banking system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some platforms are adept at gleaning online data about their customers. Borrowers, for example, must agree to allow <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> to obtain data from their employers' payroll processors. And the small-business lender On Deck has developed methods for evaluating borrowers based on dozens of online sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some investors still have doubts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One skeptical venture investor says such lending sites have flourished in an environment of a pullback by banks from unsecured consumer lending, an improving economy and a steep decline in interest rates on other investments, starting with savings accounts. Other experts note that banks have a big advantage in rock-bottom financing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's been an explosion of new companies using the Internet to originate loans,'' said Josh Koplewicz, founder of Thayer Street Partners, an investment firm that focuses on technology and financial services. ''The barriers to entry are low. There are people setting up shop with a couple hundred thousand dollars.'' But aside from a few big names like <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, he says, it may be difficult to create enterprise value without some edge in access to borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, some venture firms' investments have already shown paper losses. For example, the stakes of venture firms including <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span> and Benchmark, which invested in Prosper Marketplace from 2005 to 2010, fell in value in January when Sequoia rebooted the company with a new round of financing and a new management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosper, which started offering loans in 2006, just before <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, had offered higher rates and riskier loans, which led to investor losses in the 2008 market collapse. Prosper also clashed with securities regulators over whether its offerings should be subject to disclosure rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Prosper and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> temporarily curtailed their loan offerings in 2008 after the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> required that loans offered to average investors be registered publicly; Prosper recently reached an agreement to settle a class-action investor lawsuit over the losses. Amid the economic slump, Zopa in Britain abandoned its own costly push into the United States. And some fledgling entrants like Loanio and Pertuity Direct shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after meeting the S.E.C.'s requirements, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and its rivals have had run-ins with regulators. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> can offer its loans to investors in only 26 states but thinks those limits would melt away after an I.P.O. Both Florida and Missouri fined the company $100,000 each last year for selling unregistered securities because <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> had allowed its registrations there to lapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Ohio securities regulators filed charges against SoMoLend, an online small-business lender, accusing it of securities fraud and unregistered securities sales. SoMoLend, which declined to comment on pending talks with the regulators and on a hearing set for October, has halted transactions with individual investors in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> investors and executives are hedging their bets, taking some chips off the table even before an I.P.O. Both Canaan and Morgenthaler sold some of their shares in a $125 million stock sale in May. About 30 <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> employees, including Mr. Laplanche, sold an average of less than 5 percent of their stock as well. Insiders also sold in a recent On Deck financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, the wind of the market is at <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s back. With broad United States market indexes up more than 18 percent this year, social media and social commerce stocks have been surging even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, up 46 percent this year, recently regained its I.P.O. price after 14 months below that level. The real estate marketplace Zillow has tripled this year, and the business network LinkedIn and business-review site Yelp have doubled. Even the discount-deal service Groupon, which replaced its chief executive after its shares plunged 87 percent from the I.P.O. price, has risen 79 percent this year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREATING jobs is an essential goal today, given our high unemployment rate. But when job programs rely on taxpayer backing, their success or failure should be clearly disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the <span class="companylink">United States Department of Agriculture</span> has called its $1.6 billion business and industry loan program a rousing success. Not surprisingly, the department often trumpets the number of jobs that are expected to result from these loans -- figures that it gets from the borrowers themselves. Whether these jobs are actually created, however, is another story.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan guarantee program is overseen by the Rural Development unit of the Agriculture Department and is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Rural Development provides loan guarantees of as much as 90 percent to banks or other approved lenders that finance the improvement or development of businesses in rural and high-unemployment areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many jobs were added or saved through the loans is also a crucial measure of the program's success or failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A current success story on the agency's Web site is that of Carolina AAC, a company that received $10.4 million in late 2010 to build a concrete manufacturing plant in Bennettsville, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This project will create approximately 197 new jobs in Marlboro County,'' the Agriculture Department's Web site says. Such a figure would make Carolina AAC the program's third-largest borrower in terms of jobs created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Carolina AAC said in a January 2011 news release that only 36 jobs would be created at the project. And even that has not come to pass. Currently, 10 people work at the company, according to Charles Paterno, its managing member. Troubling for taxpayers is that the government backs 90 percent of the loans and they are in liquidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing facility is behind schedule, Mr. Paterno said, because a contractor in charge of building it died midway through the project. ''We're three months from producing but we're still on target to create 36 jobs and will ramp up to 50,'' Mr. Paterno said in an interview. Asked about the 197 job number, he said he was unfamiliar with it. The figure might reflect indirect job creation, he said, such as workers at a local sand quarry or crews that would install the cement once it's manufactured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singleteary Food Solutions is another borrower under the program. Its $4.36 million in U.S.D.A.-guaranteed loans was expected to create 220 jobs in Wells, Minn., population 2,300. Singleteary was expected to be the second-largest job creator in the program; it also received a <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> loan for about $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Wells plant never opened. The Agriculture Department loans are in default, and the bank that wrote the guaranteed loan and sold it to investors took back the property in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singleteary Food Solutions, a food processor, employed 30 people at most, according to a news report in The Faribault County Register.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen B. Singleteary, a lawyer from Chicago, is the president of the company. In an interview on Friday, he said he was seeking an additional $5 million in capital so he could restructure the debt and start up production. He said the facility needed far more renovation than he had anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once we got in, we found the infrastructure would not accommodate our process and we had to replace most of the basic things,'' Mr. Singleteary said. ''In a 100,000-square-foot facility, it adds up pretty quick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has until November to come up with the money so he can get the property back, and he remains hopeful. ''When we're fully operational it will exceed 200 jobs,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that was expected to be the largest job creator under the program was the Peninsula Plywood Group of Port Angeles, Wash. The roughly $2 million loan for its lumber mill was guaranteed by the Agriculture Department in January 2010 and expected to create 334 jobs. The facility opened for production later that year but ran into financial trouble and closed in late 2011. Local news reports said it employed 130 people at most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan has been liquidated and the Agriculture Department paid a loss claim of $958,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon for small businesses to fail, and capital nowadays is hard to come by. So some defaults are to be expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the rosy job-creation figures, Lillian Salerno, the administrator in charge of the program, provided this statement: ''Since 2009, the U.S.D.A. Business and Industry Loan Guarantee program has supported more than 3,500 small businesses that have helped bolster the rural economy in communities across the country. The program's success rate is the highest it has been since 2000, and it continues to improve. U.S.D.A., through 47 state offices, continuously works with approved lenders to ensure that each small business has every opportunity to succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE agency also provided five success stories where companies tapping into the program created more jobs than anticipated. One is Salm Partners, a food manufacturer in Denmark, Wis. The company received a $16 million loan guarantee to expand its facility and projected in 2010 that it would save 147 jobs and add 25 new ones. Today, the company employs 300 full-time workers and has paid back its loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency documents indicate that others are concerned with its job-creation numbers. A letter on Jan. 18 from the agency to business program directors of the Rural Development unit noted that the Office of Management and Budget wanted agency performance measures to be rigorously evaluated to improve programs' efficiencies. It is essential that the jobs data reported by the Agriculture Department ''is accurate, consistent, and verifiable,'' the letter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Agriculture Department's office of the inspector general recently questioned the accuracy of the agency's job figures. In a March audit, it identified one borrower that had estimated its loan would create and save 400 jobs. After visiting the borrower, investigators found that the borrower saved two jobs. ''The agency's success in meeting its established performance goals may be overstated,'' the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Brickman, a real estate investor in Dallas and a whistle-blower on problematic S.B.A. loans said, ''The willingness of the U.S.D.A. to tout false job numbers to Congress and the public is absurd and a case study of why the public has lost confidence in government.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Agriculture Department's program is certainly well-intentioned, and accentuating its positives is only natural. But with taxpayers backing this $1.6 billion effort, reliable job counts would be preferable.</p>
