<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget Web sites and molecular imaging. The biggest fields of opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs are the same mundane ventures that have been kicking around for decades.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think landscaping companies, child-care providers, janitorial services and nail and hair salons. In a generally buoyant market for low-technology businesses, those are four of the biggest winners by far. Altogether, sole proprietorships in the United States, a rough measure of the size of the small-business low-technology sector, grew by nearly 4 percent in 2002, the latest year with statistics available, to 17.6 million, and their combined revenue increased by 5.5 percent, to $770 billion. The figures come from the Census Bureau's Economic Census, a snapshot of the American economy that is taken every five years.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the trends that drove the increases in low-tech businesses have only accelerated, the bureau's economists say, as the nation's economy has rebounded and employment has recovered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in housing has increased demand for lawn care, the office construction boom has created a need for cleaning crews, more families than ever have two working spouses and need child care, and more women are treating themselves to trips to the beauty parlor, the economists say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reflects a truth about American entrepreneurship that is often lost in the breathless news coverage of the latest Silicon Valley start-up or biotechnology wonder: most of the growth involves tried-and-true undertakings that are unlikely to yield overnight riches but are open to anyone with tenacity and grit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landscaping experienced the most growth in the Census Bureau's survey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sole proprietorships that create and care for people's gardens and lawns surged by 21.5 percent in 2002, to 210,000, and their combined revenue increased by 11.6 percent, to $4.8 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hilary Finn, who runs HomeGrown, a landscaping company in Brooklyn, helps explain the profession's popularity. Ms. Finn, 46, spent a decade as a personal trainer, but after giving birth to a second daughter in 2002, decided to switch occupations, for the flexible hours and the chance to express her artistic impulses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since I was a child, I had been creating gardens,'' she said. ''I had graduated having studied painting and sculpture, but not design, at Empire State College. But I loved spaces and moving things around and creating spaces outside.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Finn enrolled in the New York Botanical Garden design program in the Bronx, and started constructing gardens in containers and window boxes. ''Then I realized that Brooklyn backyards are like a container,'' she said, and she began to work with a fellow designer to design plots that are often no bigger than 25 feet by 50 feet. Demand for her work spread quickly by word of mouth. ''My business has doubled every year,'' she said, although she noted that her revenue is not yet a living.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paula Turpin, a former school bus driver, took a different route, borrowing a few thousand dollars from the federal government to launch her hair salon, Truly Blessed Styles, in the Long Island town of Shirley, N.Y., five years ago, primarily because she wanted to run her own show.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She joined a thriving trade. The number of hair salons with the same person as owner and stylist grew 5.6 percent in 2002, the Census Bureau says, and the total number of establishments, including ones with paid staff, surpassed 400,000, with $8.4 billion in annual revenue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nail salons, which cater to the same clientele, grew even faster, up 8.7 percent to nearly 90,000, with annual revenue of $1.9 billion, the bureau says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Turpin, drawing on her experience at other hair salons, set up hers in a strip shopping center in April 2000. She styles, cuts and colors hair for her clients by herself. Ms. Turpin's retired mother helps her schedule appointments and keep the books. Her daughter, a college student, pitches in when she can to braid clients' hair.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I have my own business, and I'm able to have flexibility,'' said Ms. Turpin, 36. ''And I definitely have plans to expand. I want to add a barber shop in the back, and a place to sell beauty supplies in the front of the store.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Finn and Ms. Turpin share two distinguishing characteristics of single-owner businesses: pride of ownership and desire to take control of their lives, said Erin Fuller, executive director of the National Association of Women Business Owners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often, these owners do not want their business to become super large,'' she said. ''They take pride in their craft and, by keeping small, they can control that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Bolf, 36, is a good example of that. After divorcing her husband, she opened a hair salon in her home in Stow, Ohio, in September 2002. She sends her three children, 19, 16 and 12, off to school each morning and then cooks their dinner before her first appointment each day. That way, she can easily put the evening meal on the table.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she has fun in between. ''When it's one chair, one stylist and one client, the relationship takes a different turn,'' she said. ''It's a lot more personal, you can experiment more and I like it much better.'' Most important, Ms. Bolf says she can set her own hours and go on a school field trip or take care of a sick child whenever the need arises.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A continuing increase in the number of women in the workplace has helped spur a 5.9 percent rise in the number of child-care providers in 2002, to 619,000 with revenues of more than $7 billion. Many were run in the owner's home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleaning companies are in great demand, too. The number of janitorial services without paid employees soared by 20.4 percent in 2002, to 427,600, with almost $6 billion in revenue, the bureau says. One reason, according to a bureau analyst, was the decline in payroll jobs during the 2001 recession, which encouraged or forced many laid-off workers to branch out on their own. The same dynamic was at work in the explosion of landscaping businesses, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Littlefield started a lot earlier than that, abandoning his job in office equipment sales and management in 1990 to set up a cleaning company in Montgomery, Ala. But his reason for choosing that career is still valid today: it will never lack customers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew that I did not want to start a high-tech business,'' he said, ''because I had seen several companies built upon a certain technology go out of business overnight when a new technology emerged.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His experience is proof that lack of expertise is no barrier to success. ''The early days were rough,'' said Mr. Littlefield, because he had no clue how to clean.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he sold copiers part time and worked at a small moving company, learning the janitorial business by cleaning buildings at night. His company, Professional Facilities Management, eventually grew into a $15 million-a-year business, taking advantage of an increasing number of office buildings that needed cleaning. Mr. Littlefield is also president of the cleaning industry's association, the Building Service Contractors Association International,   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry has been helped by schools, hospitals and government agencies that traditionally had in-house janitorial staffs but are now using contractors for the work, said Marketdata Enterprises, a independent research firm based in Tampa, Fla., that studies service industries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial cleaning industry rolled unscathed through the 2001 recession, according to Marketdata, with revenue growing 5.5 percent in 2002 and 5.9 percent in 2003, to $94.5 billion. John LaRosa, a spokesman for Marketdata, said his firm estimated that growth last year was 6.3 percent and that total receipts could exceed $128 billion by 2008.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a low-tech business that's easy to enter, and many do,'' he said, with some entrepreneurs finding lucrative niches like damage restoration, mold remediation or maid services.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was Mr. Littlefield's experience. He figured that to thrive in an industry where two out of three firms lose their contracts within a few years, his company had to become what he called a total facilities service provider. So he began developing a package of services, including housekeeping, landscaping, labor, minor maintenance and security services.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, July 1 -- Japanese corporate leaders were more optimistic about their prospects in June than they were three months earlier despite signs of a slowdown in exports, according to a quarterly business survey by the Bank of Japan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unexpectedly upbeat result of the central bank's closely watched Tankan survey of about 10,000 companies suggests that the economy continues to recover from a shallow recession last year as domestic demand grows.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence improved in most categories of businesses, though large companies remained significantly more upbeat than small ones.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark index of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 of Japan's biggest companies, rose to 18 in June, from 14 in March. The index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of companies that say conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. A positive score means the optimists outnumber the pessimists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said one of the most encouraging parts of the report was a strong improvement in confidence among service companies, like banks and department stores. Confidence among large service companies rose to 15 in June, the highest level since 1992, from 11 in March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that a wide range of companies are becoming more optimistic even as exports remain relatively weak shows that businesses think that consumption may be strengthening after years of stagnation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the last decade, growth in the Japanese economy has been driven primarily by exports. Though robust export growth has generated a series of relatively strong recoveries in recent years, each has been short-lived because demand at home has lagged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last year, the economy has shown new signs of life. Banks have cleaned up the bad loans that once saddled their industry, and many big companies are hiring again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy is coming back onto a normal footing,'' said Stefan Worrall, an economist in Tokyo for Credit Suisse First Boston Securities. ''This is obviously feeding into the confidence we are seeing. Sentiment among manufacturers has been surprisingly resilient.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's unemployment rate remained at a six-year low of 4.4 percent in May, unchanged from April, according to a separate government report. Another report released Friday showed vehicle sales rose 8.6 percent in June from a year earlier.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a steamy morning in late June, as the 3,000-square-foot house was nearing completion, a tractor trailer pulled into Mr. Milite's driveway and deposited a 20-foot shipping container sent from Indonesia. It contained an entire houseful of furnishings, unloaded by a crew of 10, that Mr. Milite (pronounced mih-LIT-ee) had ordered eight weeks earlier from Andrianna Shamaris, the owner of stores in Malibu, Calif., and SoHo in Manhattan.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shamaris, who lived in Indonesia for more than a year after leaving London, her childhood home, imports furniture and clothing -- including items of her own design -- from Bali, Sumatra and Madura. With warm natural materials, clean lines and simple silhouettes, her furniture is at once modern and exotic, primitive and sophisticated -- more Christian Liaigre than Pier 1.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She helped pack more than 90 items (70 of them pieces of furniture) into the container bound for Mr. Milite's home while on one of her periodic buying expeditions in Indonesia in May. The contents included recycled teak slab and rattan sofas, a bed made of salvaged timbers, hand-carved sculptures of tamarind wood, raffia pillows, chopsticks and lacquered palm wood bowls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milite hired Ms. Shamaris after visiting her SoHo store, and after seeing the interiors of a sprawling beachfront home, just down the street, that she had furnished for his friend Danny Errico, a founder of the Equinox gym chain and now a partner in James Hotels.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shamaris does not consider herself an interior designer, and she did not charge Mr. Milite a design fee above the price of the furnishings, which cost $35,000, plus $5,000 for shipping. (Ms. Shamaris said she gave Mr. Milite, a former model and well-connected restaurateur, a $30,000 discount in the hope that her work for him will lead to other clients.) She said she is generally able to offer goods below normal retail prices because she acts as designer, manufacturer and retailer, and because she works directly with artisans throughout Indonesia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milite said he felt from the outset that the sand dunes and coastal pines around his house called for simple interior materials. ''We're surrounded by a nature reserve, so I said we needed natural woods and fabrics. The house has a lot of wood, very little Sheetrock,'' said Mr. Milite. ''I didn't want a faux Balinese house. I wanted it to feel like a beach house on Long Island.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Ms. Shamaris visited Mr. Milite's house, a clean-lined, contemporary take on the classic Hamptons shingle style designed by James D'Auria, an architect with offices in Manhattan and Amagansett. Inside, the house is modern and loft-like, a minimalist-goes-craftsman style with a sloped ceiling that peaks at 25 feet in the living room, cedar paneled walls, a polished concrete tile fireplace surround and a hearth open to both a sitting area and the kitchen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shamaris concluded that the lofty ceilings and bright rooms called for a few large furnishings, ''not lots of little things all over the place,'' she said, referring to the tendency to fill beach homes with nautical keepsakes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scale, shapes and materials are complementary to the house,'' said Mr. D'Auria.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since many of the furnishings Ms. Shamaris designed for the house were custom-made in Indonesia, Mr. Milite, a self-confessed ''control freak'' who normally spends years looking for the right couch, didn't know exactly what they would look like until the container arrived.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was really nerve-racking. I had no idea what was going to come out of the truck,'' said Mr. Milite, 46, an owner of three restaurants, including the Coffee Shop on Union Square. ''It was like a blind date, but with furniture that I was stuck with.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shamaris kept her cool. ''He stood there and said, 'This better be good,''' said Ms. Shamaris, 39, as she reclined last month on a teak chaise by Mr. Milite's pool in low-cut jeans and a crocheted bikini top. ''I said, 'Darling, just chill.'''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milite had the assurance that Ms. Shamaris's clients include George Clooney, Daryl Hannah and Katie Ford. ''A lot of her pieces combine an Asian feeling with a clean modern look,'' said Ms. Ford, the chief executive of Ford Models, who bought a pair of bamboo tables and an antique Indonesian throw for her SoHo loft from Ms. Shamaris. ''They have a warm ethnic or indigenous feeling, but they're not hippie looking.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, the pool deck is the hub of summer entertaining. Ms. Shamaris obliged by ringing the pool, where Mr. Milite hosts informal parties, with rattan floor pillows she designed and a teak platform bed for three that she had fabricated in Jepara, in Central Java. As cooler weather arrives, the focus will shift to the eat-in kitchen, which Ms. Shamaris furnished with a hefty table made of joined slabs of raw teak wood with curved edges. Ms. Shamaris left the tabletop completely natural: no shellac or stain. For a contemporary counterpoint to the table's organic curves, she designed straight-backed dining chairs in white resin, with slices of bamboo embedded in the resin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shamaris said she wanted to design ''something primitive but really sexy'' for the second-floor master bedroom. So she created an oversized platform bed framed in well-worn beams and floor joists salvaged from old houses on Madura, an island off the northeast coast of Java. Ms. Shamaris gave them a shiny patina by rubbing the lip of a Coca-Cola bottle over the wood. ''It makes the wood look like glass,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shamaris estimated that each of the bed's roughly eight-foot-long by eight-inch-wide slabs of ironwood, a dense hardwood, weighed about 200 pounds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This furniture is pretty much indestructible, unless you take a hacksaw to it,'' said Mr. Milite. ''That's what you want at the beach, to be able to lock the door when you leave and not worry about precious things.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SMALL-BUSINESS owners must often juggle the same complex accounting, legal and management issues that large corporations do without nearly the same resources or staff. ''There are so many factors involved, and the interplay between the personal and business complicates things even further,'' said James A. Seidel, an executive at RIA, which provides small-business advice. While there is no substitute for hands-on experience, here are some tips that can help out small companies:   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take advantage of free online services to register your company and establish an employer taxpayer code. Today, several government sites are making the registration process paperless, fast, easy and free. Many states have Internet sites where entrepreneurs can check off whether a new company will be a sole proprietorship S-corporation or C-corporation; each has legal and tax pros and cons. The Internal Revenue Service has forms online for establishing an employer identification code, required for opening a corporate bank account and filing taxes. Of course, forming a company is more than filing a document. Most small-business experts recommend consulting a lawyer first. ''If you set up the wrong type of entity, you may be hamstringing yourself and you may have to start over,'' Mr. Seidel said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set up a board of advisers. For small-business owners, a large Rolodex of industry contacts can be critical for success. But how does one develop such a network? Eva Rosenberg, publisher of TaxMama.com, suggests that entrepreneurs establish an advisory board that includes a handful of industry experts, local business leaders, an important supplier and customers, as well as the company's outside lawyer and accountant. The members, she said, should be paid a small retainer for their work and meet formally once a year to discuss big-picture plans. A side benefit may be access to their contacts, not to mention specific advice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit-card transaction fees may be more negotiable than you think. Credit-card companies tend to group small merchants in categories, like restaurants or retail stores, that are all charged certain transaction fees. But if you can make a case that you deserve better, it may be possible to lower those rates. Small-business consultants advise talking to trade association and other industry contacts to find out what similar companies pay, then approaching the credit-card companies. ''A lot of times they will negotiate, and if they won't, go back every six months and try,'' said Stephen Spinelli Jr., an entrepreneurship professor at Babson College who advises small and medium-size companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep your eye on the cash. For small businesses, cash flow is king. But the reality is that most owners are not good at managing it. ''They either work on a low cash balance, or if things go well, they may use their company as their own personal bank,'' Mr. Spinelli said. For businesses with a steady stream of revenue, Mr. Spinelli recommends having at least enough cash to cover one purchasing cycle. Then if a key customer has to cut back on orders, he said, or another unexpected disruption occurs, there is time to recover. For fast-growing companies, planning is crucial. Explaining your business strategy to vendors and suppliers may be the best way to prevent a cash shortage early if you expect to be flush with money later. ''What happens, usually, is they make the call at the time of need rather than doing the planning in advance of the need,'' Mr. Spinelli said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hand off a headache. Managing the monthly payroll can be as big a headache for a 14-person company as it is for a corporation with 14,000 employees. There are literally thousands of different tax regulations that make it difficult for the small-business owner to navigate. That is why Mr. Spinelli says it is more efficient and cost-effective to hire a company, like Paychex, for the task. For about $150 an employee, a payroll service company handles everything from entering tax deduction and bonus information to cutting the checks. ''What most small-business folks do is try to do it in house because they don't want to pay that bill,'' Mr. Spinelli said. ''But they usually parcel them out to someone in the organization. But if they're not skilled, they can get in trouble by filing improperly or late.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONVENTIONAL wisdom asserts that most small companies cannot afford to offer retirement plans. If they do -- so the conventional wisdom goes -- it will be the most bare-bones 401(k), with the employee contributing all the money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the independent Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington seems to support these assumptions: while only 16.3 percent of people working for a company with fewer than 10 employees had access to a retirement plan in 2003 (the most recent figures available), the numbers rose in lockstep with company size, reaching 72.6 percent of workers at companies with at least 1,000 employees.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the money management industry has created a variety of relatively low-cost retirement plans tailored to small companies, even those with just one or two employees. And more businesses are signing on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, more than 367,000 businesses with fewer than 100 employees now offer 401(k) plans, up from about 169,000 a decade ago and 260,000 in 1998, according to the consulting firm Cerulli Associates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The competitive pressures in the marketplace are the biggest impetus'' for business owners, said Charles Ledbetter, a senior vice president of the giant insurance brokerage Marsh Inc. and a specialist on retirement plans. ''It's probably the third-most important thing people ask in a job interview,'' after salary and health insurance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2001 federal tax law gave the trend a push by introducing several incentives for small-business retirement plans. Probably most important were tax breaks that let owners and top managers put substantially more money into their own accounts than the rank and file can -- a disparity not usually allowed in these programs. Moreover, the administrative costs can often be kept to a few hundred dollars a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the plans may seem similar. They generally work like a 401(k), with the employee getting an individual account, making the investment decisions and bearing the risk. Savings are almost always tax-deferred. But each plan has special features that might appeal to different types and sizes of small companies:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Most contribution limits are indexed annually for inflation, so the figures in this article pertain to 2005. For workers age 50 and over, the limits are usually a little higher.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIMPLE I.R.A.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is essentially a streamlined 401(k), limited by law to companies with a work force of 100 or less.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees may put in their own money, up to $10,000 a year, while the employer must contribute in one of two ways: matching employees' contributions up to 3 percent of their pay (to a maximum of $10,000), or paying a flat 2 percent of the salary of all eligible employees (to a maximum $4,200 a person), regardless of whether they contributed. Virtually all employees become part of the plan from the day they are hired. Thanks to minimal government paperwork, administering the plans runs just $10 to $50 an employee a year, experts say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big disadvantage is that simplicity can mean inflexibility. In a Simple I.R.A., the employer's contribution is the same percentage for everyone, even employees who stay only six months. For the larger small businesses, that can add up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem is the relatively low contribution limit. ''If you've got a business owner who may be 45 or 50 and he's spent all his time and assets to get the business going, now he needs to put away $20,000 a year for retirement,'' said Michael J. Patton, a financial planner with J.P. Morgan Chase. ''The Simple plan won't allow him to put that much in.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all those reasons, Mr. Patton and others say that Simple plans generally appeal to companies with a staff of 10 to 15 and low turnover. ''This is more of an employee benefit, not a tax break for the owner,'' said Joanne Voelcker, the principal in charge of small-business services at the Vanguard Group. Using the guaranteed employer funding as a lure, ''it would be good for an industry where you're competing for employees.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simplified employee pension, known as SEP, is another pared-down plan aimed at the smallest companies, but with a starkly different approach than a Simple I.R.A. It is so flexible that employers can contribute zero to 25 percent of each employee's pay to a maximum of $42,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the percentage can change each year, as long as it's the same for all employees. ''If you don't have a profit, you don't have to contribute,'' Mr. Patton said. Employees, meanwhile, put in nothing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second advantage is that the high maximum gives the business owner a big tax shelter. And there is little paperwork to file with the federal government.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these plans share a disadvantage with Simple I.R.A.'s: virtually all workers must be covered equally from Day 1. Accordingly, experts recommend the plans for professional companies, like doctors' offices, with small staffs and low turnover. They are also good for companies with volatile earnings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">401(k)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 401(k) is the giant of the retirement world, accounting for about 41 percent of the $4.9 trillion in all company-sponsored retirement assets, Vanguard says. It allows every gimmick and frill a manager could want. For instance, matching contributions by the company are voluntary, and employees can be required to wait as long as a year before becoming eligible, which solves the high-turnover problem. But with a huge amount of government paperwork and administrative costs of typically a few thousand dollars a year, small businesses have difficulty affording a 401(k).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some variations meant for small companies, especially for owners who want to amass a large nest egg.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''individual,'' or ''solo,'' 401(k) is specifically for companies in which the only employees are the owner and spouse. There is also a ''safe harbor'' 401(k), in which companies must contribute to all employee accounts. In return, this is one of the times when the 2001 law lets higher-income managers put in a bigger percentage of their compensation than lower earners can.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 1, a new plan, the Roth 401(k), will be available. Contributions are taxable going in but tax-deferred when withdrawn after age 59 1/2 -- similar to a Roth I.R.A. but the opposite of a standard 401(k).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROFIT SHARING   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A profit-sharing plan has the flexibility of the simplified employee pension, in that companies can change their contributions year to year. And like the 401(k), it allows a waiting period before employees are eligible. The biggest disadvantage is that the company has to file the same complex paperwork as with a 401(k).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a profit-sharing plan can be a business's sole retirement vehicle, many managers tack one of these on top of a 401(k) to increase their match in good times. There are also variations, like ''age-weighted'' profit-sharing plans that allow bigger percentages for older workers -- which often means the owners and top managers -- on the theory that they have less time to build up their savings. Generally, these plans may be good for start-ups with unpredictable cash flow or high turnover.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEFINED BENEFIT   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If any kind of retirement plan would seem impossible for a small company, it is the traditional pension, or defined benefit, plan, in which the company sends checks to every retiree, bearing all the responsibility of financing and investment risk. Yet plenty of small companies are embracing these programs, particularly those with fewer than 25 employees and owners who are nearing age 65.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often it's the only way an older key employee or owner can save fast enough for retirement,'' said Elise Pilkington, assistant director of marketing for retirement and investor services at Principal Financial Group in Des Moines. That's because the pension is based on age, years of service and salary, a formula that usually favors owners and top managers. When Principal hands out its annual awards for small companies with the best benefits, a substantial percentage of the winners usually have these plans. Any retirement program may be expensive for businesses to have, Mr. Patton of J.P. Morgan Chase said, but ''they can't afford not to.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's one way of measuring the recovery: as of last week, about 2,400 applications had been filed, and so far none have been approved for small businesses.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, federal and state agencies, legislatures and private groups are putting in place a wide range of assistance for small businesses. But right now, the businesses themselves are assessing what they need.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only was a whole region devastated, but small businesses also suffered disproportionately because the Gulf Coast had a large number of companies with fewer than 50 employees, according to economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stop for small-business owners is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which screens and refers callers to the Small Business Administration for emergency disaster loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small business can qualify for up to $1.5 million under two different disaster recovery loan programs, said Carol Chastang, a spokeswoman for the agency. The Physical Disaster Business Loan provides loans, at 4 percent for up to 30 years, to help rebuild and replace lost items like office furniture and computers. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan offers loans, at the same rate, to allow companies to pay routine expenses, including payroll, rent and utilities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, President Bush said he wanted to set up a ''Gulf Opportunity Zone'' in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, which would encourage small businesses to stay and new companies to open by providing them with tax breaks and loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both houses of Congress are planning to broaden financial aid offerings for small-business owners struggling after Katrina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate last week passed measures to allow deferred repayments for Small Business Administration disaster loans for one year, and to increase their size to $10 million from $1.5 million. The House is considering proposals to broaden the agency's authority to allow it to assume a business's pre-existing debt payments for up to 36 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louisiana is also trying to help what may be as many as 100,000 small businesses affected by the hurricane. Last week, the Louisiana Economic Development Agency announced several programs to help businesses return to normal, including working with Alabama and Mississippi to develop an overall federal aid request modeled after small-business assistance in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist acts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry set up a Small Business Disaster Relief Fund to finance ''gap funding'' to pay any small-business expenses that are not covered by insurance, said Daniel Juneau, the association's director. This is important because flood damage is not covered by routine insurance policies, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, which has 5,000 small-business members in the state, said it had set up a Web site, AccessLouisiana.com, that matches businesses in need with those that have services to offer. National groups are lending a helping hand. The National Small Business Association, an advocacy group, is trying to raise $250,000 for expenses not covered by insurance, said Scott Hauge, the founder of Small Business California, a group affiliate. The United States Chamber of Commerce's Center for Corporate Citizenship provides a resource guide on its Web site, uschamber.com/ccc, to help businesses identify their needs and resources to fill them, said Stephen Jordan, the executive director. The center also has a job bank to seek and place workers; it collects money to help small businesses and is in the process of setting up a program to connect companies that want to ''adopt'' storm-affected businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Federation of Independent Business has a guide to hurricane assistance on its Web site, nfib.com, and its state representatives are working to help members. Ron Aldridge, the state director for Mississippi, estimates that 20 percent of the federation's 5,000 members in the state were hit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another small-business matchmaker is the National Association of Women Business Owners, which has joined other women's business groups to set up a Web site, womenbizrelief.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the hurricane region, the Small Business Administration has 14 disaster recovery centers in Louisiana, eight in Alabama, six in Texas and five in Mississippi and more than doubled its work force, to nearly 2,000 people, to help process disaster relief loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many small-business owners cannot focus on filling out government paperwork when they have more immediate tasks at hand, like searching for missing employees. John Rowland, for instance, left behind his 20-year-old company, Southern Hospitality Catering, in New Orleans when he evacuated hours before the hurricane. ''Right now we're looking for the people we lost,'' he said, speaking from a cellphone at a relative's home in McLean, Va. ''And then we will definitely be looking for capital to get started again.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily for Mr. Rowland, his building, in the city's warehouse area, is still standing although it needs repairs and to clean up spoiled food. He had been preparing a welcoming party for new students at Tulane University, which was cancelled as Katrina bore down on New Orleans. But he will have access to his financial records, which are necessary to fill out the Small Business Administration loan form.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Typically, completing these forms takes a while,'' Ms. Chastang said. After small-business owners assemble their financial records, connect with insurers to assess damage, check local banks for loans and fill out the federal loan forms, their situation must be assessed by an agency loan verifier who physically examines the business before the federal loan is approved.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest need right now, said Michael A. Mitterknight, an air-conditioning contractor in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans, ''is money to help us keep afloat for a while, and money that can be paid back over a period of time.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mitterknight, whose business suffered limited damage and is already back at work, said, ''As much as I hate to say it, and I never believed in give-away programs, but just give me what I need to keep going.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finland once again ended up in first place in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks 117 countries, while four other Nordic countries made the top 10. The United States, the world's largest economy, again ended up in second place.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study assigned scores to nations by looking at factors like government economic policy, the strength of local institutions and the degree to which technology has been used to bolster growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan fell to 12th place, from 9th; Britain slipped to 13th, from 11th; Germany dropped to 15th place, from 13th. Spain fell to 29th, from 23rd; and France fell to 30th, from 27th. Italy remained in 47th place, between Greece and Botswana.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''High labor market rigidities, and, in particular, the ease of hiring and firing, contribute to explaining why Europe lags behind U.S. performance,'' Beatrice Weder di Mauro, an economics professor at Mainz University, wrote in a paper for the forum. ''Improving the flexibility of labor markets should be high on Europe's reform agenda.'' Japan's rating fell because of ''the deterioration of its public finances,'' she wrote, though it the country more than compensated for it with its ''impressive technology performance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nordic countries, in contrast, drew praise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margareta Drzeniek, a senior economist at the World Economic Forum, said, ''The reasons for the strong performance by the Nordic countries is that they have very transparent systems, high levels of technology penetration, a well-educated work force and good macroeconomic management.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African and Latin American nations filled most of the bottom spots, with Chad in last place. Two of Latin America's largest economies fell in the rankings: Mexico to 55th place, from 48th, and Brazil to 65th, from 57th. Chile, however, came in 23rd, outscoring some of the European Union economies on government transparency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance of the Asian economies was mixed. Many of the so-called tiger economies in Asia ranked well, with Taiwan in fifth place and Singapore sixth. Tiger economy countries are nations that achieve high growth by pursuing an export-driven trade strategy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest gains came in South Korea, which jumped to 17th place, from 29th last year, in part because of high scores in technology. The World Economic Forum report said that rapid growth in China and India, which placed 49th and 50th, respectively, could be threatened in the long term by factors like poor education systems and low use of technology. These factors were ''likely to slow down their ascension to the top tier of the most competitive economies in the world.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China dropped from 46th place, while India rose from 55th. China and India lagged in the index because of ''serious problems'' with corruption, bureaucracy and education, Ms. Drzeniek said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high rankings of Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Norway highlighted the countries' ability to foster a climate in which business can flourish while they also run large social welfare systems. Their success can in part be explained by high taxes, which most citizens accept in exchange for free health care and education, affordable child care and generous unemployment benefits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the high taxes have not discouraged entrepreneurs. The World Economic Forum praised Finland, home to global companies like Nokia, as ''one of the most innovative business environments in the world.'' The forum also highlighted Finland's ability to run a budget surplus while many European countries face large deficits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States remains at the cutting edge of technology, the report said, citing its ''pipeline of innovation second to none in the world.'' But a growing budget deficit and other macroeconomic concerns kept it out of the top spot, according to the report.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lo, 46, is the chief executive of Ruckus Wireless, a Silicon Valley start-up that is developing technology to connect home appliances wirelessly, including computers, televisions, satellite or cable boxes, even stereos.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a prize sought by many entrepreneurs despite the obstacles involved in creating uniform standards to link a host of consumer electronics. The challenges include coordinating telecommunications companies, computer companies and appliance makers; creating a technology consumers can use easily; and developing a sound business model.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's the microwave. It is one of the many everyday items that can cause changes in airwaves and thus disrupt fragile wireless transmissions between, say, the cable box and the television. Other sources of disruption are as simple as human movement or interference from a neighbor's wireless signals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Ms. Lo, a veteran entrepreneur with a whirlwind style (and occasionally salty vocabulary), whose company has developed a multipronged antenna that is the underlying technology in its new wireless router. The antenna monitors the airwaves and changes the path of a wireless stream of data to avoid potential sources of interruption.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our software can actually change the antenna orientation in a millisecond,'' she said. ''If the microwave turns on, we find a path that actually faces the other way.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lo is already enjoying a taste of success. Her company last month began shipping its products to PCCW, a telecommunications provider in Hong Kong that delivers television channels over high-speed Internet lines. Ms. Lo said PCCW intended to use the Ruckus technology to send an Internet signal wirelessly from the point where the cable or satellite line enters the home to a computer or television set-top box.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a long way to go before wires are removed from the home entertainment experience, despite vocal assurances from the consumer electronics industry that the wireless home is right around the corner.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Ask, research director at Jupiter Research, said that while momentum was building, the wireless home ''is not close.'' She added: ''There isn't somebody taking a lead in integrating the systems in the household.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jupiter's research, for example, only 2 percent of those who use Wi-Fi in their homes apply the technology to send video signals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Gartenberg, vice president and research director at Jupiter, said the few people using wireless technology to, for instance, allow their TV's to stream programming from their computers, were early adopters who did not mind spending quality time with the user manual.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dad has to be C.I.O., mom's running the help desk and the kids are doing tech support,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many entrepreneurs and major companies are working to resolve these technological and business issues. Frank Hanzlik, managing director of the Wi-Fi Alliance, a trade organization in Austin, Tex., representing 240 computer and electronics makers worldwide, said it would take three years before Wi-Fi was a mainstream technology used for a wireless entertainment system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts say it is too soon to tell whether Ms. Lo has what it takes to break out of the pack and become a leader. ''There are a lot of folks doing stuff,'' Mr. Gartenberg said, referring to the competing ways of unwiring a home. ''We're still in the nascent stages of this.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lo, who has been with Ruckus since May 2003, when it was called Video54, officially introduced Ruckus under its new name last month. One thing it has going for it is $14 million in venture capital financing, including $9 million that was committed last month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the lead investors, Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif., invested in Ruckus because it thought the company's new antenna and its underlying software was a major competitive advantage, said Gaurav Garg, a partner at Sequoia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The antenna looks a bit like a flat star fish with six prongs. It is unusual in that it constantly monitors the airwaves for disruptions, then changes the direction that a signal is being sent. If, for instance, the direct line between an Internet signal and the computer or television is suddenly disrupted, the antenna would find one of 62 other routes. If a direct path between two appliances is disrupted, the antenna might avoid the interference by picking a cleaner path (like bouncing the signal off the walls).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prongs of the antenna don't actually change direction, and the antenna itself does not move. Instead, software inside the antenna selects the best path and uses the corresponding antenna prong to send the information. In fact, the software and the antenna are embedded in a wireless router that is attached to the point where a television or Internet connection enters the home. The antenna then distributes the signal wirelessly throughout the house.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creators of the antenna, the engineers Bill Kish and Victor Shtrom, have been developing the technology with help from Sequoia since early 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Ms. Lo was in her second semiretirement. One day, while waiting at home for the satellite technician to hook up a new television, she became frustrated about having to lay more wires throughout her house to connect all her gadgets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought, what if I want to move my TV? What if I want to move my furniture? Do I have to get the cable guy out again?'' she said. ''We are slaves to all the cabling and wiring.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lo quickly learned that there are steep challenges in technology and in business. She was brought into the company to confront both, particularly to find a way to make the technology profitable before all parts of a wireless home are in place.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her solution is to take baby steps by creating partnerships with telecommunications companies. Similarly, she hopes to appeal to telecom giants in the United States like SBC Communications. Her sales pitch is that telecom providers, by using her wireless access points, can save money because they will not have to deploy technicians to drill holes and lay wires in consumers' homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lo said the recommended price is $169 for the antenna, and $129 for the adapters that would allow appliances to receive the signals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A first-generation immigrant who grew up in Hong Kong, Ms. Lo came to the United States to study at the University of California, Berkeley, where she graduated in 1982 with a degree in computer science.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She spent six years at Hewlett-Packard, working in software development and sales support, before deciding the company was too big for her. She thought the next company she worked for, Network Equipment Technologies in Fremont, Calif., was also too big, even though it had only 2,000 employees. In 1993, she decided to start her own company, co-founding Centillion, a maker of telecommunications equipment that was acquired two years later for $140 million by Bay Networks.   </p>

''I like to make money,'' Ms. Lo said, ''and I like to spend it. I don't like the keeping-it part.''

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE years ago, Teri Gault was working a collection of part-time jobs and raising two teenage boys in Santa Clarita, Calif. Her husband, Greg, earned most of the family's income working as a movie stuntman. Parsimonious by nature (her children often used other words for it), Ms. Gault had a favorite hobby -- she clipped coupons, managing to feed her family for only $37 a week. It was a skill that came in handy when work dried up suddenly for Mr. Gault, a side effect of the movie industry's relocating much of its production to Canada.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needing not only to save money, but to earn money, Ms. Gault turned her hobby into a business -- Grocerygame.com -- and built a network of franchisees in 48 states offering subscription advice on grocery savings. She now has 26 employees. Her husband is one of them.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women are starting their own businesses at a far higher rate than men, and it follows that many, like Ms. Gault, are hiring their husbands. Couples have worked together since the days of the family farm and the mom-and-pop store. Is the dynamic different when he works for her?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, yes,'' said Tamara Monosoff, founder of Mom Inventors Inc., which licenses baby products invented by mothers. Her husband, Brad Kofoed, joined the company in July of last year and is now director of sales. ''I couldn't work for him,'' she said, only half-joking. ''If he ran this it would feel like a hierarchy. Women are more collaborative, so it's more of a partnership.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gault acknowledges that ''it was a little bit of an adjustment,'' when she first asked her husband to help out. It was in 2003, when she began franchising and desperately needed a ''girl Friday to sit next to me'' and take care of the details. Mr. Gault took on the role and ''he just worked his tail off,'' his wife said, though he did have a tendency ''to ask me for things he could find himself, like the number of our accountant, because he was used to asking me for things like that at home.'' He did so well that he is now the company's chief financial officer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gina Seamans, who founded Accent Public Relations seven years ago and whose husband, Jim, is her vice president for operations, said, ''It took us both a while to get comfortable with me gaining the 'boss' power.'' The only thing they ever argue about as a couple, she says, is the to-do list she gives her husband, um, operations vice president, every week. ''It is a constant issue,'' she said, ''for me to walk the line of seeing it as 'work' rather than a 'honey-do.'''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carefully delineated job descriptions seem to be crucial in these work-life relationships. Susan Dunk, inventor of the ToddlerCoddler, a device that provides head and neck support for children in car seats, invited her husband, John, to handle accounts payable and shipments when business grew 900 percent last year. ''I told him I was founder and C.E.O. and he would get to be president,'' she said. ''The C.E.O. gets to fire the president.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separation of space is another. The Gaults share an office, but have a partition down the middle so they can talk to each other while maintaining separate turf. Sharon DiMinico, who started the franchise company Learning Express in 1995 and relies on her husband, Lou, to oversee the leasing agreements, needs more distance. ''We have a 10,000-square-foot building,'' she said of their headquarters. ''He's upstairs on the extreme right and I'm downstairs on the extreme left. We cross paths at meetings.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest issue of all, however, seems to be money. Although a few of the women bosses I spoke to earn more than their husbands (''that makes sense to both of us,'' Ms. Dunk said), most avoid the landmine in the most collaborative way.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gault said: ''He's the C.F.O., so he decides our salaries. Every time I get a raise, he gets a raise. He will not let me make more. He just gave both of us bonuses and he gave us the same. I said I want one dollar more and he won't give it to me.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Seamans goes one step further. Having brought her husband on board to rein in her ''control freak tendencies'' about money, she keeps up on the broad strokes of their finances but remains purposely in the dark about their relative salaries. Every month, Mr. Seamans hands her two paychecks. The first one is hers. ''He gives it to me upside down,'' she said, ''so I can endorse it.'' The second one is his. ''He gives that to me right side up so I can sign it. I always see what he gets paid, but I never see what I get paid. I hope I'm making more than him.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, to a T-shirt.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last five years, Rebecca and Paul Steinman have been building a business in Brooklyn producing screen-printed T-shirts -- an enterprise that they started, in part, to supply another company that Mr. Steinman was already operating.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other company specialized in renting equipment for movie shoots, and Mr. Steinman often had T-shirts made that he handed out to promote that business. He ordered the shirts from companies that embellished items to order.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, Ms. Steinman said recently, she and her husband decided that they knew enough about screen-printing to produce the shirts themselves. Moreover, she said, they decided to start a business that would screen-print T-shirts for other companies that wanted them for distribution as promotional products, gifts or mementos.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as part of their new venture, they would also screen-print their own line of designer T-shirts for sale to the public.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted to satisfy my own creative urge, to put my own work out there,'' said Ms. Steinman, 32, who majored in theater at the University of Michigan with a concentration in costume design. Shortly after they were married in 1999, she began working in her husband's movie equipment rental business, which he had started with a partner in the early 1990's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and Mr. Steinman, 35, called their screen-printing business Quist Industries Ltd. -- a name that might not indicate what the company makes but ''stands for quality, utility, innovation, style and technology,'' Ms. Steinman said. In 2001, Quist's first full year of operation, it had $14,000 in sales, she said. By last year, annual sales were up to $90,000, and she estimated that this year they would be more than $120,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the rising revenues, though, the business remained in the red until last year, when ''we just about broke even,'' Ms. Steinman said, adding that she expected only a slight profit this year. As with many growing businesses in their early years, the increased revenue has been made possible by increased capital investment and staffing, which, of course, has raised costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Steinmans hired their first full-time Quist employee, a studio assistant, in January 2004, and they currently have two full-time workers, a printer and a saleswoman. They have bought a $40,000 automatic screen-printing press, with a production capacity of several hundred shirts an hour, replacing the hand press that Ms. Steinman said could produce no more than about 100 shirts an hour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In screen-printing, a stencil of an image is produced on a screen of mesh material -- polyester in Quist's case -- that has been stretched over a frame, and a special ink is applied through the stencil to adorn the fabric. Photo-sensitive emulsions, a light table with a high-intensity light, and a dryer with a conveyor belt are also among the materials and machinery in the company's production line in an old industrial building on the waterfront in Red Hook.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Steinmans continue to operate the movie equipment rental business, Dragon's Head Productions, at the same location, but they are spending an ever greater portion of their time on Quist. Mr. Steinman said he thought they would phase out Dragon's Head ''somewhere down the road'' to concentrate entirely on the print-screening business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, about 80 percent of Quist's revenue comes from jobs done under contract for other parties, including companies, nonprofit groups and designers who are putting out their own lines of screen-printed merchandise but contracting with companies like Quist to apply the adornments. T-shirts are still two-thirds of Quist's contract jobs, but now the company also embellishes items like tote bags and baseball hats. It also does embroidery.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Steinman said she hopes to increase her company's own line of designer T-shirts, which are sold in small stores, from 20 percent to 50 percent of revenue. ''We've produced about three dozen designs and are now showing about a dozen,'' she said, pointing to a row of shirts that are part of the company's ''urban wildlife series.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the colorful images is an orange and brown squirrel adorning a gray shirt. (On a pink shirt the squirrel is fuchsia and black.) There is also a pigeon, ''our biggest seller,'' Ms. Steinman said, and a rat, which also does well. And a giant cockroach. ''People love it or can't stand it,'' she said.   </p>

Your boss is nice enough. The pay is decent, but you need something more. So amid the buzz of the office environment, you temporarily turn your attention to the Web to order supplies for You Inc., the small business you have quietly started on the side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wait a minute. You have crossed the line. According to experts on business ethics, workers aren't supposed to use their employer's resources for their own entrepreneurial endeavors.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, experts on entrepreneurship say, would-be magnates should focus on their time outside the office, asking questions like, Am I really using my home computer, my Internet connection and my daily commute as efficiently as a business would?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For aspiring entrepreneurs, viewing your life as a business can be critical to preparing for operating a business full time, says Judith Cone, a vice president of the Kauffman Foundation who is in charge of its programs encouraging entrepreneurship. ''If you're going to apply an analytical, strategic approach to your business idea,'' she said, ''it makes a lot of sense to turn the spotlight on you as the vehicle that's going to make this happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, small-business owners and advisers suggest a few areas where you may want to make improvements as you contemplate an expansion of You Inc.:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EMBRACE THE ESTABLISHMENT  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government help available to small businesses can often be specific, like a loan program exclusively for export businesses or a federal contract seeking minority-owned businesses, said Ivan Szanto, a retired business executive who mentors aspiring entrepreneurs at the New York City district of Score, a nonprofit group affiliated with the Small Business Administration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find all applicable programs would be too time consuming for most business owners -- ''dozens and dozens of programs might apply to this business,'' said Mr. Szanto, assistant district director of Score's New York chapter. Instead, counselors can provide that information free and quickly, he said. ''We used to say it's one of the best-kept secrets'' for entrepreneurs, he said. ''A lot of people don't know that we exist. What we do is give them practical advice.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the counselors are unlikely to find details on government financing to start a business, Mr. Szanto said. ''There is a belief out there that the government gives grants, but that's a terrible misconception,'' he said. ''There are almost no grants from the government to start a business -- but there are loan guarantees.'' With government loan guarantees, entrepreneurs can often borrow more money to start their businesses than lenders would allow otherwise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Szanto says that a Score counselor can also advise budding business owners of ethical ways to tap their current employers for help in starting their businesses. He gives the example of a legal secretary who may want to open a side business typing up documents. ''That's fine,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warns, however, that employees must be careful not to exploit their employer's resources for their own business: photocopying materials, making calls on company time and basically using any resource that a boss would be displeased to know about are all unethical.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, most companies have a formal disclosure process when it comes to outside commercial ventures. Follow it to the letter, Mr. Szanto advises; for many people it will mean telling a boss about the business and promising that their job performance won't suffer. They need never mention it again -- unless they have to break the news that they are leaving to run their business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USE BROADBAND BETTER  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While you may be accustomed to multiple phone bills, it should be tougher for You Inc. to dismiss Internet phone service for as little as $10 a month. James E. Gaskin, who profiles broadband phones in ''Talk Is Cheap,'' says that unless you never make long-distance calls and have no extra features on your land line (even call waiting or caller ID), using your existing broadband connection for phone service will inevitably save you money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afraid the lines may be unreliable? When Hurricane Katrina left land lines and cellphones useless, Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans used Internet phone service, running eight lines from one account.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are your finances. Sure, the bank is on your way to work, A.T.M.'s are everywhere, and paying your bills by mail takes minutes. But conventional banking and bill paying are time-wasters compared with their online alternatives, as Robert Siciliano, a security consultant, said that he learned after founding IDTheftSecurity.com in 2000. Although he said he preferred back then to pay and receive his own bills by mail, the needs of his clients and vendors pushed him to manage his business accounts and invoices on the Web. ''In the corporate world, you don't want paper, you want things streamlined,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made the switch with his personal finances: he now banks online and receives his phone and cable bills by e-mail. ''I don't deal with paper anymore, and I learned that in business,'' he said, ''because in business, time and efficiency are everything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DON'T FORGET TO BARTER  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know about bartering in your personal life, don't you? When you ask friends to cat-sit or help you move, do you usually offer them cash? No, you promise them dinner or homemade cookies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet most small businesses do not swap goods and services. Although the International Reciprocal Trade Association, an industry group, estimates that bartering last year amounted to $4.4 billion in North America, that activity was concentrated in fewer than 1 percent of businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Krista Vardabash, the association's executive director, says that many business owners mistakenly think that bartering occurs under the table and requires one-on-one exchanges.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because it's just a different concept, they almost automatically assume that it can't be legit,'' she said. There is misinformation about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more familiar form of bartering is offering a small stake in your business in exchange for any number of services. To build up what is now Homestead Technologies -- a Menlo Park, Calif., company whose do-it-yourself Web sites have attracted 12 million registered users -- the founder, Justin S. Kitch, swapped shares in the company for legal services, reduced rent and even discounted lines of credit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When starting out, ''all you really have to offer is your energy and passion and expertise,'' Mr. Kitch said, ''and there are a lot of people willing to work with you in some way or another.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of barter exchanges operate nationwide, allowing far more trades and much more flexibility. Rather than having to swap directly for what you want, you can offer your services and earn ''trade credits'' through the exchange.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though no money changes hands, such trades are still treated as cash transactions for tax purposes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DELEGATE  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your ability to outsource and delegate, including at home, can make or break your blossoming business, experts say. As sole proprietor of You Inc., you could pool your efforts with other businesses, says Frances McGuckin, a small-business adviser and author of books on entrepreneurship. You can also outsource tasks to technology or appliances -- have bills paid automatically online, buy tax-preparation software or let a digital video recorder like TiVo remember to save your favorite shows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such delegating is also good business training, helping you to rely on a network of vendors, bankers and others. It not only frees up your time but also keeps you from making costly mistakes, particularly on tax forms and other legal documents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your most important allies will be a smart lawyer and a deft accountant, says John Thaler, a specialist in small-business law and the owner of an independent record company in Studio City, Calif. ''My lawyer friends and I have a saying, It doesn't take 100 clients to build a successful law practice; it takes five who never listen,'' Mr. Thaler writes in ''The Elements of Small Business.'' ''Don't be one of those five.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- AT a Senate hearing last week, Walter Isaacson, the former CNN chief who is vice chairman of the agency leading Louisiana's recovery from Hurricane Katrina, identified the state's two highest priorities: stronger levees and loans to help the 80,000 or so small businesses in the hardest-hit areas stay afloat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as of yesterday, the Small Business Administration said that it had approved only 1,078 loans to small businesses for property damage or economic losses across the Gulf Coast from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while denying 1,945 applications. According to the agency, 24,268 business-related loan applications were still being processed.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anger at the slow pace spilled over at the hearing last week, before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Isaacson said that in the hard-hit areas of Louisiana, as of Nov. 3 only 276 business loans had been approved, a pace he called ''devastating, '' while rejections were ''alarmingly high.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, a committee member, complained that ''Our businesses were wiped out by a wall of water, while S.B.A. help is coming in at a trickle.'' The committee's Republican chairwoman, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, said she had ''growing doubts about the agency's management and leadership.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hector V. Barreto, the agency's administrator, insisted that the disaster ''is 10 times larger than any disaster we've had before.'' Because the agency handles loan requests after disasters from homeowners as well as businesses, it has been swamped by more than 200,000 homeowner applications. The agency has quadrupled its work force, to nearly 4,100.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto told Congress that the agency received 55 percent of the applications in the last two weeks of October and first week of November, giving the short-staffed S.B.A. little time to sift through them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the agency had processed only 17 percent of the loan applications filed, say Senate committee figures, and has a backlog that will take at least four months to get through at its current pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Snowe said the agency dragged its feet when it should have recruited more loan officers immediately.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the S.B.A. may well receive nearly twice as many applications as have been filed so far, committee members warned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lagging loans are just one more aspect to an already grim situation, state officials contend. ''The situation is not good here,'' said Mary Lynn Wilkerson, director of the Louisiana Small Business Development Center. ''Clearly the loans are not coming quickly enough, and we have lost 40 percent of our small businesses so far.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Don Johnsen, who owns Royal Crown Coffee Service Inc., which provides machines and supplies for coffee and tea to restaurants, schools and businesses in New Orleans and Slidell, La. He had no insurance, and he says he needs $70,000 from the agency to tide him over until he can rebuild his business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I applied about six weeks ago,'' he said, ''but I have not had any contact since then, not a phone call or even a letter of receipt. This can't go on too much longer since I can't even pay myself.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency says it is simplifying its loan requirements, and announced last week a pilot program called GO Loans, which allows a small business to borrow up to $150,000 from a commercial bank within 24 hours after its application. The loans, available through next September, are 85 percent guaranteed by the federal government; interest rates are set by the banks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This contrasts with S.B.A. disaster loans, which have a low 4 percent rate, and pits the program against legislation, introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, to authorize money for bridge loans to carry small-business owners over the lengthy agency approval process. Senator Snowe and some of her colleagues blamed the Bush administration for derailing the $450 million assistance package on bridge loans, which passed the Senate unanimously, by allowing it to be cut recently from the final legislation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it was awaiting federal aid, Louisiana started its own bridge-loan program for small businesses, said Donald M. Pierson, assistant secretary of Louisiana Economic Development. ''We've exhausted the $10 million in funding,'' he said, ''and we've only scratched the surface. We could have used $150 million to $200 million.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern over the lumbering pace of loan approval and the high rejection rate, legislators, including Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Small Business, have asked for the Government Accountability Office to investigate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier budget cutbacks led to eliminating some S.B.A. offices and consolidating others this year. Congressional critics think this set the stage for an inadequate response after Katrina. Another major complaint has been the agency's new computer system, which requires scanning all applications submitted on paper.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An agency spokesman, Dennis Byrne, responded that the unprecedented number of applications had created ''capacity concerns.'' He said 5,000 applications were being entered into the computer system each day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be too late for many owners. Mr. Johnsen, the operator of the coffee service, said he might close his business and walk away after 20 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I figure that if by the end of December, I don't have the loan,'' he said, ''I will have to close up.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the special Small Business section on Nov. 16 about the business strategies of nanotechnology companies misstated the use of the product sold by Aspen Aerogels and the company's pricing practice. The company sells its nanoporous insulating material for oil pipelines, not water pipelines. The insulation is sold per square foot, with the price negotiated before delivery; it is not sold on the basis of how much money a company will save by using the insulation in its pipelines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Nov 26 2005   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEW business executives can explain nanotechnology, but plenty of them know they are wearing the results: L. L. Bean khakis and other clothing engineered for exceptional stain resistance. They may have also used clear sunscreens made with particles of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that block ultraviolet rays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when corporate bigwigs head to their country clubs, there is a good chance they will encounter someone who has heard about NanoDynamics, a start-up in Buffalo that has been promoting its ability to rearrange the molecular structure of golf balls to damp the physical forces that send poor shots slicing or hooking.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder it is hard to find big-business executives who don't know that their business might be affected by the growing ability of researchers to manipulate the very molecules out of which everything is made. The field is known as nanotechnology because the measuring rod of its products is the nanometer, which is a billionth of a meter and the size of the smallest molecules. Nanotechnology has spawned hundreds of companies in the last decade and attracted billions of dollars in government and private investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is going to take more than the first wave of novel products to convince big businesses that access to the new technology is worth quite as much today as many of its entrepreneurs believe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, at least, seems to be the message in a recent survey of nanotechnology start-ups and large multinationals by Lux Research, a New York company that focuses on nanotechnology. Three out of four nanotech start-ups negotiating deals with the big companies think they have the power to set price and other crucial terms, according to Lux's survey of 20 companies averaging 29 employees and $2 million in annual revenue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Lux asked the same questions to materials buyers at 20 multinationals averaging 100,000 employees and $55 billion in annual revenue, 70 percent said it was their company that dictated the terms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lux also found other disagreements on what the ideal deal looks like. For instance, 65 percent of the small companies wanted the multinationals to pay them license fees. But only 35 percent of the big companies wanted to take such licenses. Many of them want to handle nanomaterials like the commodities they are often replacing: tell us what the product costs per unit and then ship us as much as we want.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clashing value assessments and goals have stalemated negotiations and aborted deals, according to David Lackner, author of Lux's report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No surprise there, according to experts who study entrepreneurial activity across the economy. ''Most entrepreneurs overplay their hand,'' said Steven Rogers, who teaches entrepreneurial finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long run, getting a good partner is probably more important for a start-up than getting a good price. Take the case of Ecology Coatings, based in Akron, Ohio, which makes proprietary nanoscale and somewhat larger micron-scale particles for blending specialty paints. The resulting paints reduce reliance on dangerous solvents, cure rapidly and produce thin but extremely abrasion-resistant surfaces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potentially valuable niche identified two years ago by Ecology is the demand for cleaner and faster ways to recoat the hundreds of millions of propane tanks from home barbecue units that are recycled each year. But the equipment maker that Ecology dealt with to build specialized recoating machines substituted 300-watt ultraviolet lamps for the 600-watt units Ecology had specified for its drying process. That attempt to cut costs led to dismal results when the units were delivered to the tank company, according to Richard D. Stromback, Ecology's chief executive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To preserve the business, Mr. Stromback this year negotiated an exclusive license for Red Spot Paint and Varnish, a major coatings specialist based in Evansville, Ind., to manage design of the equipment and servicing of the tank refillers. ''They have the clout we don't to get this done,'' Mr. Stromback said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stromback said there had been no risk of similar missteps when Ecology sought to get its materials incorporated in paints for the automotive market. Within a week of acquiring control of Ecology in 2002, Mr. Stromback called on DuPont, the leader in automotive coatings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It costs $2 million a minute if you delay an auto production line, the capital equipment you sell them has to pay for itself in 12 months, and they demand that you have full-time employees there servicing them,'' he said. ''It's prohibitive for a small company to introduce new technology into that space.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some start-ups have decided that the best way to avoid pricing battles is to accept terms in which they are not paid for the materials but get a percentage of the big business's gains from using them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Mr. Lackner said, Aspen Aerogels, in Northborough, Mass., makes a novel insulating material that allows water pipe manufacturers to reduce the total outer circumference of their products and seeks to be paid a percentage of the production savings. Oxonica, in Kidlington, England, asks for a percentage of the fuel savings that bus fleet operators get from its nanoengineered catalyst.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are saying, we won't try to prove the value to you, we'll just take a percentage when you find it,'' Mr. Lackner said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some nanotechnology entrepreneurs have relied on government-financed research contracts to carry them through the long search for commercial partners. ''At the end of the day, the Fortune 500 companies are going to call the shots,'' said David Reisner, president and chief executive of the Nano Group. ''They define all the things that come to roost if the deal unravels.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes intermediaries can bridge the gaps. The Cabot Corporation, a large specialty chemicals company based in Boston, last year set up the Cabot Fine Particles Network to serve as a matchmaker between its customers and nanotech start-ups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do a light due diligence to understand what they do if they want to be in the network,'' said Jack Reder, new-business project leader at Cabot. ''After that we do nothing until we get a request from a customer for something that's somewhat tangential to what we offer. We tell the start-ups what the needs are.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some nanotechnology executives believe their leverage will increase as more big companies decide that nanotechnology is beginning to deliver on its potential and that they don't want to be left behind. Others say big business will always hold most of the cards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, seeing eye-to-eye may never come naturally. ''If an entrepreneur fails, he just does his next start-up,'' said Vinod Khosla, a leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist who deals with nanotechnology. ''If the business executive fails, he gets fired. They have very different cultures.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF there is one place where the idea of the ownership society is taking hold, it is America's colleges and universities. More than 1,600 colleges offer courses in entrepreneurship, up from 1,050 in the early 1990's and a mere 300 schools in the 80's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts see the surge reflecting profound changes in the American economy. It is a response to globalization and the fact that ''two billion people in the world want to do the same job you do,'' said Paul Merage, an entrepreneur and philanthropist who endowed the business school at the University of California, Irvine, this year with $30 million.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Merage, who invented the microwavable frozen snack Hot Pockets, demanded that the curriculum at the newly renamed Merage School of Business stress innovation and ways ''to grow a business.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Thomas O'Malia of the University of Southern California also sees uncertainty driving the spread of own-your-own-shop education.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no job security,'' said Professor O'Malia, program director at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurship, a specialized unit within U.S.C.'s Marshall School of Business. ''If the average corporation must recreate itself every 3.4 years, you need to think about controlling your destiny.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students, however, seem driven less by fear than ambition -- even passion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maya Gowri, for example, who organized a nutritionist practice at a hospital in her native Chennai (formerly Madras), in India, and came to the United States to earn a doctorate in biology from the University of Kentucky, is happy that she also studied two years and paid about $70,000 in tuition to earn a master of business administration degree last year from U.C. Irvine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.B.A. studies ''taught me about function and marketing and helped me find a business partner to raise finance,'' Ms. Gowri said. With a few employees and a fellow Irvine student, Charles Hsu, as a money raiser, she has begun Discovery Services International, which performs research for small biotechnology companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another student, Emily Chan, is in the final leg of a three-year part-time program of study for a business master's at U.S.C. while holding down a job planning auto plant locations for the Toyota Motor Company in Torrance, Calif. It is a good job, Ms. Chan said, but her real ambition is to develop ideas about animal feeds into a business of her own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chan, who rescues injured dogs, has developed a formula for feeds that she says help animals recover. So she is going to classes at night and on weekends and paying about $80,000 over three years to earn the degree.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've always had the passion but not the confidence to get started,'' Ms. Chan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At her stage in the master's program -- called ''feasibility'' -- she works with other candidates to see if her concept can work as a real business. In fact, Ms. Chan needs to sell the product in a commercial market -- as opposed to just doing a college experiment -- or she will not pass the feasibility course, said Professor O'Malia, who likes to call the entrepreneur program a boot camp.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, the program sounds more like athletic coaching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Half of what I teach is technique -- how to organize, control cash flow and such,'' said Prof. Fred Kiesner, who teaches management and entrepreneurship there. ''The other half is to get inside your heart and soul and mind and say: 'You can do it. Don't fear failure. If you're not risking failure, you're not stretching to try something new.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At U.S.C.'s entrepreneurship center, students are taught a distinction between management and entrepreneurship. ''A good manager thinks efficiently of how to go from A to B,'' Professor O'Malia said. ''But entrepreneurs are a little like Columbus, thinking effectually how to go into the unknown.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often entrepreneurial success doesn't involve derring-do as much as forming alignments and reducing the need for capital. ''Entrepreneurship is about organization, not lone-wolf operators,'' said Christine Beckman, professor of organization at the Merage school.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two University of Southern California graduates, one from 1989, the other from 1998, illustrate the point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Smart, attending the university in the 80's, heard a visiting insurance man say that his business was being hurt by poor service from car-towing companies that were paid $600,000 a year. So Mr. Smart asked for a chance to do the towing, traded his car for a tow truck and started gathering up crashed vehicles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As business grew, he did not use his new company's capital to buy more vehicles but had his drivers buy them, creating new small-business owners and allowing greater expansion of the towing company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I learned in business school,'' said Mr. Smart, whose companies now tow 500 cars a day in the San Fernando Valley, ''is that the cash-flow account is more important than the profit-and-loss statement.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the other student, Todd Stennett, graduated with an M.B.A. in 1998, he and his wife, who have two children, owed $82,000 in credit-card debt. But Mr. Stennett saw opportunity in a federal policy encouraging small companies to commercialize government technology, like the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's powerful lasers for mapping land.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stennett could not afford to buy a $1.5 million laser, but he lined up scores of land-surveying businesses as customers whose contracts helped him pay for the equipment. He also joined bush-pilot outfits to help the surveying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our relationships with partners are critical to our success,'' Mr. Stennett said, as his company, Airborne 1, reaches $5 million in annual revenue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Andrew Policano, dean of the Merage school, the benefit of entrepreneurial training nowadays is that it encourages original thinking.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANITOWOC, Wis. -- ALMOST every significant American economic era is apparent in this neat-as-a-pin city on the western shore of Lake Michigan. Its agrarian heritage is reflected in the farms lying at the city's edge, and a beer-malting plant at the center of town. The maritime and industrial eras are represented by a coal-fired ferry that crosses Lake Michigan, and the steel cranes built here by the 103-year-old Manitowoc Company. The rust belt period, with its manufacturing-job losses and downtown decline, is still felt in slow population growth, modest housing prices and shuttered plants.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the newest era of this city's history, the Internet is propping up bricks and mortar downtown, acting as a mainstay for the stores that have helped Manitowoc establish what development specialists call a ''recreational'' shopping experience. Indeed, besides generating sales for giants like Amazon, the Internet is allowing small stores, here and around the country, to develop the niche products that shield them against big-box retailers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the revenue from online sales, Manitowoc's merchants say the biggest benefit of e-commerce is that it enables them to turn over their inventory much more quickly, so owners can add more products and variety to their sales floors. That, in turn, encourages more interest and customer traffic, diversifies the revenue stream and contributes to downtown street life here and in other small cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A walking tour of Manitowoc, population 34,000, reveals several examples of the convergence of new technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Eighth Street is the kitchen supply retailer Cooks Corner, which occupies a 20,000-square-foot store that was once a Kresge's. The company, which is 11 years old, employs 35 people and stocks 15,000 gadgets and appliances; its Web site, cookscorner.com, accounts for a third of the company's revenue. Of the 1,000 customers who visit the site each day, roughly 200 place a digital order, said Peter Burback, the company's owner and founder with his wife, Cathy. The site has also elevated Cooks Corner to regional and national attention.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burback keeps a customer log of cash-register receipts totaling 170,000 people who visited the store last year. ''We're the No. 1 tourist draw in the city,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the corner from Mr. Burback, on Ninth Street, is Healthy Chocolate Treats (healthychocolatetreats.com), a business founded in April by Paul Stitt, a 65-year-old biochemist who turned another Manitowoc-based specialty food company, Natural Ovens Bakery (naturalovens.com), into a $29 million-a-year business that gets 20 percent of its sales from Internet orders. Healthy Chocolate Treats, which employs seven people and attracts 100 or so retail customers a day, specializes in vitamin D-fortified candies. Its revenues have already reached nearly $40,000 a month, a third from orders from the Internet, Mr. Stitt said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby on 10th Street, the Fitness Store (thefitnessstore.com), founded in 1993, sells an array of exercise and cardiovascular equipment. John Brunner, the 44-year-old owner, says that his 2005 sales are expected to reach $2.5 million, twice as much as last year. ''The Internet accounts for 75 percent of our sales now,'' he said. ''I started the company in 1993. We launched a Web site in 1995. I didn't know the Internet was going to be such a catalyst for growth until 2000, when we developed an e-commerce site. We're making huge gains now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, the Internet's influence on helping small businesses was anticipated. In 2002, the Small Business Administration published a study finding that 61 percent of small companies managed a Web site, and 35 percent were selling products online.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was not as clear was how the Internet could contribute to so many downtown revivals. Hours north of Manitowoc, in the rugged Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Marquette is also undergoing an economic transition from being a mining-based city of heavy industrialization to a recreation and tourism economy centered on its access to Lake Superior.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One anchor of Marquette's revival is the Getz Department Store, a family-owned business that has been on Front Street since the late 19th century and now earns roughly half its sales revenue by selling Carhartt and North Face clothing on the Internet (getzs.com). The company's Web site has also helped to establish Getz's, as it is also known, as one of the city's tourist destinations, along with the county courthouse a few blocks west, where scenes from the 1959 Jimmy Stewart film ''Anatomy of a Murder'' were shot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other examples exist. In upstate New York, downtown Ithaca is a hub of new retail activity and tourist trade generated by Internet marketing and sales. ''There's an upside and a downside of marketing on the Internet,'' said Gary Ferguson, the executive director of the Ithaca Downtown Partnership, a business development group. ''The floral business has been changed dramatically by the Internet. More and more people are buying flowers online. We had a business called Plantations that had been here for 30 years and had a hard time with the transition and didn't make it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the other hand, we have three used-book stores, and they do half their business on the Internet,'' Mr. Ferguson said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Beeswax Candle Company in Lynchburg, Va., started three years ago as an Internet business with a store located on the edge of downtown. Because of rising sales at beeswaxcandleco.com, the company moved into a larger space at the center of town.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Internet has taken a small family-owned candle business and allowed us to compete on a national level while contributing to the redevelopment of our downtown area in central Virginia,'' said Kathy Shaw, the founder.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several merchants said that preparing for the transition and managing Internet marketing, sales and distribution was not easy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-commerce requires a business to change its infrastructure in four ways: The first is understanding the computer hardware and e-commerce software and managing vendors, servers and consultants. The second is applying the technology to sales and marketing by designing the Web site's back-end ordering platforms for customers, while making the front-end digital showplace clear, attractive, informative and navigable. The third phase is hiring a consultant or training staff members or doing both to manage the site. The last is developing the capacity to quickly fill and ship orders, respond to returns and replace inventory, most of which can also be done on the Internet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Manitowoc, small businesses are tapping into the online sales world primarily through pay-per-click advertising offered by Google's Adwords and Yahoo's Overture. Both companies require e-commerce retailers to bid on keywords and phrases to drive customers to Web sites. Mr. Brunner of the Fitness Store said he spent $6,000 a month on Google and $2,000 a month on Yahoo. But he also gained $240,000 in revenue in August. ''I expect to do more than that in November and December,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Dennis Mingay, the general manager of Getz's, said the cost of Internet advertising can be a big concern. Getz's, he said, is spending nearly $1 a click. ''We're trying to master the marketing strategy to get that down so it's affordable,'' Mr. Mingay said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to do that is through e-mail. Getz's has a list of 20,000 e-mail addresses. Cooks Corner has 35,000 addresses, which it taps for promotional newsletters. Mr. Burback said that e-mail marketing had been successful, accounting for 75 percent of the company's orders in the week or so after they are sent. E-mail, he added, has helped Cooks Corner contain the cost of Internet advertising to $2,500 a month.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW hot is the pet market these days? Think dog purses, cat strollers, ''Cab-bone-net'' wine-flavored dog treats and sitters hired to watch television with Fido, and some sense of the lunatic growth becomes clear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the boom has created lucrative opportunities for small-business owners, but as more big companies take note, the market could become more difficult for the niche firms that are now flourishing.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large companies that dominate other sectors of the consumer economy -- like Wal-Mart and Target -- are adding more pet products to their shelves, and the two big players already in pet supplies, Petco and Petsmart, are expanding at a breakneck pace.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're concerned,'' said Tom Measday, a co-founder of NJ Pets, which has three stores in New Jersey. He said he expected Petsmart to open a retail operation in East Hanover, N.J., near one of his stores. ''What we've seen from the big companies, let's say Petco and Petsmart, is they tend to look for the most successful store and that's where they put their store.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Measday had to contend with one of the two big pet-supply retailers once before, he said, but it closed. This time, he thinks that a new competitor will put up more of a fight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about 75 employees, Mr. Measday has a solid midsize business. But for much smaller companies, the pet boom presents more opportunity than threat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pet Dreams, a small Manhattan company selling ''cratewear'' -- accessories for dog training crates -- was founded by Annette A. Grignard, one of many entrepreneurs who are making a living selling solutions to a problem that customers did not know existed. The kits she sells include a mattress for the animal to sleep on, bumpers to protect the animal from injury against the crate's metal bars and a cover to make the crate more attractive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first such kit ''was just for my personal use,'' said Ms. Grignard, who used to work for a pharmaceutical company in Manhattan. ''People were coming over to my apartment and saying, 'Omigod.' '' She started her business in 1999 and later received a loan from the Small Business Administration for $250,000. Today she has manufacturers in China and uses a warehouse in New Jersey to distribute the kits, which cost $30 to $70. Business has grown rapidly, and she is shipping thousands of kits every month to a range of retailers -- including big stores like Petsmart.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pet supplies now fuel a $37 billion industry. Retail sales of pet supplies, not including food and services, amounted to $8.5 billion in the United States in 2004, more than the $6.2 billion spent on baby-care supplies, according to Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com. And pet supply sales are growing at 7 percent annually, as sales of baby supplies are decreasing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the companies in the business are small, said Bob Vetere, chief operating officer of the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Greenwich, Conn. Over the last three years the number of members in his organization has jumped to nearly 900 from just over 500.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe 60 to 70 percent of them are new or start-up companies,'' Mr. Vetere added. ''These numbers continue to grow.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone has a theory about why so many people are spending more and more money on their pets -- primarily cats and dogs, by the way; Mr. Vetere said that in the 69 million households with a pet, there are 90 million cats and 77 million dogs. All the theories are difficult to prove.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who are single or whose children have moved away may become more attached to their pets, treating them as members of the family rather than as, well, pets. In a world that feels more uncertain, the benefit of coming home to an enthusiastic welcome every day may be deserving of a bigger reward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a human, to just buy him a dirty old tennis ball is just not enough, even though he doesn't care,'' Mr. Vetere said, referring to his dog, Dakota. ''I feel better because I've given him something more than just a tennis ball.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''Does it absolutely make sense? No.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the feeling is clear. Many people refused to leave New Orleans without their pets during Hurricane Katrina, and in light of that devotion, several members of Congress have proposed legislation requiring consideration of pets in future evacuation plans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign of stronger human-animal attachments may be the increase in the number of social activities that people engage in with their pets, like dog runs where animals can run freely as their owners mingle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is new, Mr. Measday said. When he grew up, most people didn't even walk their dogs, said Mr. Measday, who is 59. Instead, he said, they let pets out of the house and trusted that the animals would find their way home. Now, he said, ''Dogs and cats really are an integral part of the family.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the main force pushing people to spend more on their pets may be mundane: marketing. Several business owners cited Paris Hilton and her famous Chihuahua as making the world safe for tiny dogs, clad in fashionable sweater sets, carried in matching purses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three years ago, we didn't sell the purses,'' Mr. Measday said. Now his stores sell, besides purses, strollers for very small pets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses have tapped into a potent marketing tool by inciting a pet owner's sense of loyalty, said David Lummis, a pet market analyst for Packaged Facts. ''This human-animal bond is just being fully exploited by marketers,'' said Mr. Lummis, who owns two dogs and four cats, all of which he took safely from his home in New Orleans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is excess in the pet market, though, Mr. Lummis said. ''A lot of it is trading people up to more expensive products, basically, and making people feel like, 'Hey, it's O.K. for me to spend $20 on a bag of dog treats instead of $2.99,' '' he said. ''These dog treats are going to be really good for my dog, and he's going to love them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But describing some of the pet snacks and services available does not begin to capture the range of goodies that are out there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Fideaux, a pet supply boutique in Healdsburg, Calif., just a few of the offerings include leather collars imported from Switzerland for $60 to $100 each; ''Cab-bone-net'' and ''Char-dog-nay'' wine-flavored treats for $9.95 a bag; and brightly striped beds for summertime, and red and green beds for the holidays that cost $60 to $150.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's done very seasonally,'' said Erin E. Morris, a co-owner of Fideaux. Business at the store's two locations is booming, she said, mostly because tourists visiting the wine country nearby miss their pets and buy things to take back to them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Fideaux's suppliers is Up Country Inc., a Rumford, R.I., company that makes collars, toys, beds and other products. Alice M. Nichols started the business in 1984 to have more flexible hours and to be able to spend more time with her children. She had been a schoolteacher.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I researched different industries, the pet industry was the most interesting, because it was growing very fast'' and was considered recession-proof, Ms. Nichols said. ''It wasn't that I really had an idea about the dog collars,'' she added, but she quickly focused on collars as a product with great demand, because every dog needs one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She started by designing the collars and then delivering raw materials and the designs to a belt maker in Marblehead, Mass., not too far from her home. Now she has 22 ''stitchers'' who make collars. Last year the company sold more than 500,000 collars and leashes through retailers nationwide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market may be growing most quickly in services. Reba Jackson of Austin, Tex., a part-time entrepreneur and an independent contractor to cellular telephone companies, opened up a business with her husband, Nelson, last year, offering to pet-sit while owners are on vacation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Business picked up pretty quickly right after we opened,'' Ms. Jackson said. Now their two-person company, Ruff Around the Edges, has contracts with several apartment buildings, so that if tenants need pet care, the building managers call her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We check their food and water, but basically it's just some playtime with them,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''We're the most reasonable in the area and we charge $15 a visit.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pet-sitting costs more, about $35 a night. Over all, in a slow month, Ms. Jackson said, she and her husband take in about $3,000, and during the holidays she thinks that amount will double as more people go away. Her husband quit his job as an insurance claims adjuster to cater to pet clients full time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the special services, like watching television with a client's dog. Usually, Ms. Jackson said, it's a dog-friendly movie like ''All Dogs Go to Heaven.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked whether she had expected such demand for pet services, Ms. Jackson paused, then said, ''It is crazy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She researched the business carefully beforehand, spending almost a year reading about dog massages and other services and the people who pay for them. ''People will do crazy things for their pets,'' she said. ''We do, my husband and I, so why not think that there are lots of other people like us?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of pet owners with similar attitudes, along with the near-100 percent markups on many types of pet supplies other than food, have led to steadily increasing sales at the industry's two giants, Petco and Petsmart. Both chains are opening stores around the country at a rapid pace and are expanding their service offerings, too.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petco, for example, which has about 765 stores and 17,000 employees, will have opened 90 new stores by the end of the year, said Kevin Wayland, a company spokesman. Petsmart, the larger company in terms of sales, has more than 750 stores and is opening more at the rate of nearly 20 each quarter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart is also paying more attention to pets, said Karen Burk, a company spokeswoman. ''You may have noticed a few more offerings of some items as we become more in tune with what our customers are looking for with their pet needs,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''We understand that pets are members of the families and people want to pamper them and have fun with them. It could be a fun new pet bowl, a stylish jeweled collar or even a costume for this past Halloween.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While statements like that are worrisome to midlevel retailers like Mr. Measday, he expects that the big stores will have a hard time matching his staff's expertise and familiarity with customers and their pets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His stores also offer more specialized equipment -- high-end purses, sophisticated saltwater fish tanks or expensive bird cages, for example -- than larger competitors. He also said that his employees spend more time making sure that items are properly fitted or set up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have greater variety,'' in prices and range of items, Mr. Measday said. ''That's why when you see the Petcos and Petsmarts coming, you still see the small stores.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years ago, after all, pet supplies were sold in big variety stores like Woolworths, and that business plan fell apart, as increased specialization led to smaller stores and the more focused chains of today. It is unlikely, he said, that the world will revert to an all-in-one store.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we started, it was the time in the States that people were going to specialty stores,'' Mr. Measday said. By opening a specialty pet store, he said, ''We guessed right.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And whatever its size, not every pet industry business is destined to succeed, many of the store owners said. Ms. Nichols of Up Country recalled attending a trade show for pet suppliers and talking to a fellow would-be entrepreneur who had a bold vision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some fellow who owned a liquor store said he was going to put in a pet section,'' Ms. Nichols said. ''People have an unrealistic expectation of the pet industry.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RANDOLPH, Vt. -- AFTER three years of riding the Internet to steadily climbing sales, Eric Truran decided to use the Web to move his small manufacturing business, CourierWare, in another direction. He wanted it to shrink.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most small-business owners, Mr. Truran first viewed the World Wide Web as an opportunity to grow. But as time went by, he came to see it as the opposite -- a way to close up his Cambridge, Mass., retail store, move the business to his home in this Vermont village and accomplish his real goal: spending time on the things he wanted to do rather than running CourierWare.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Web part of the business was growing,'' said Mr. Truran, whose company is known for its high-quality, durable messenger bags. ''It was the only part of the business that was truly growing.'' CourierWare, which also stopped publishing its mail-order catalog in 2001, now takes only phone or online orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his Internet choices show, Mr. Truran is not like most small-business owners. After 15 years of growth, CourierWare's retail business was stagnant, and corporate sales were starting to slip. The company's sales peaked around $500,000 in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He saw two options -- expand the business or reduce it. Fearing an economic downturn and unhappy at having to spend 80 to 90 hours a week working, Mr. Truran chose to downsize. He closed CourierWare's Harvard Square store, laid off his eight employees and focused exclusively on the Internet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My whole business philosophy is, enough is enough,'' he said. ''Anything more than that and you just work all the time.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Truran now works part time, probably 15 or 20 hours a week. He is also selling fewer bags -- sales are about $100,000 a year now -- and earning about $50,000, about half of what he made in the mid-1990's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has better things to do now, like playing guitar with his two bands, a rock cover band that goes by various names, and the Kind Buds, a ''Jerry Garcia-inspired jam duet'' that plays original music.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life was quite different in 1983, when Mr. Truran moved to Boston after going to Trinity College in Hartford, hoping to make it as a musician. To pay the rent until he hit it big, he took a job as a bicycle messenger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It soon became apparent to him that neighboring Cambridge could use its own courier company, so Mr. Truran and his friends started one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He imagined spending his days answering the phone while he played the guitar. Instead, he spent entire days calming irate customers who demanded to know why their packages had arrived wet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer was obvious, Mr. Truran said. After a few months of use, the seams on the couriers' bags would split and the liners would peel away, allowing moisture to seep in, Mr. Truran explained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He could find no other supplier for courier bags, so Mr. Truran would pick apart the bags at home, deconstructing them to see which aspects worked and which didn't.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He knew the retail business -- his family owned a furniture and gift emporium in East Wareham, Mass. As a child, he learned basic sewing from his mother and honed his skills in prep school, where he made burlap bow ties to wear with his uniform.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He experimented with various materials for a new bag, and settled on Cordura, a waterproof nylon manufactured by Invista. He designed the bags so the seams were joined between the layers of fabric, so they would not split.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Truran said that he and his wife, Diana Salyer, who is a partner in CourierWare, took their bags to stores around Cambridge, but none were interested in selling them. Abandoning the idea of wholesaling, the couple took out a $4,000 loan to begin making and selling the bags themselves. The venture was successful; they paid off the loan and soon sold the courier company to concentrate on the bag business. The couple opened their store in Cambridge in 1991.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought it was a pretty good design,'' Mr. Truran said. ''It was designed by people who used it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1994, the store was self-sufficient and had enough inventory that Mr. Truran and Ms. Salyer chose to move to this small town, where they set up the manufacturing portion of the business. The move, he said, was possible because of that initial decision to stick with retail, enabling the company to operate debt-free.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was still free of debt in 2001, but overhead -- including rent for the Cambridge store and salaries and health benefits for his employees -- was eating up 80 percent of the company's sales. The venture was also eating up Mr. Truran's time because he spent a good part of each week in the car commuting from Vermont to the store.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hooked on a calmer outdoor life of skiing and biking in Vermont, Mr. Truran decided to move the business to his home, where he would process the Internet orders and make the bags. Much work was already done in the form of the store's inventory, valued around $100,000, which he transported here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His home is a 7,500-square-foot space in the basement of an old sewing factory, with the upper floors now housing other small businesses. Ms. Salyer runs a yoga studio and massage and bodywork business out of two rooms in the back. The studio is the only room with a window; Mr. Truran said a lack of natural light helps sewing and keeps the space cool in the summer. His bands rehearse in the living room, and he leases out a room to the Vermont Independent School of Music.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Woodwinds are on Thursdays,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet, he said, allowed him the opportunity to move there, significantly cutting the business and its overhead but retaining its most profitable arm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It took 15 years until the Internet was a profitable enough marketing tool,'' he said. ''We had a broad enough base that we didn't feel it would incur that much risk.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took that long to build up the customer base. Mr. Truran and Ms. Salyer decided not to market their product, except for small advertisements in the Boston Review, a political and literary publication, and the Utne magazine. Mr. Truran thinks the bags speak for themselves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bag itself is its own advertising,'' he said. ''It's the outermost garment. Because of the rarity of them you don't see them everywhere. We're guerrilla marketing, word of mouth. Our phone number is on every bag. People will ask other people where they got their bag, and they'll call.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Truran is so proud of his product that each bag comes with a lifetime guarantee and free repairs, although he said only about 20 bags a year came back for that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Couriers have never made up the bulk of buyers, he said, since many expect to move on to other jobs and do not want to spend money on such items, despite CourierWare's discounts to them. (It offers seven styles of bags and laptop inserts, from $35 to $179.) Instead, most of the customers are individuals who can afford a well-made bag.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markup on the bags is typically four times the materials' cost, higher than usual because the company sells only retail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Truran, whose corporation rents his office to himself, said his only overhead costs were fabric, of which he buys 2,000 yards a year, rent, Internet and phone charges and miscellaneous expenses, allowing him to keep half the sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a typical busy month, Mr. Truran's Web site drew 19,050 page views and 50 orders, totaling $5,700 in sales. Mr. Truran estimates he sold 25 more bags over the phone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Truran says he is not in the business to get rich, he knows that CourierWare could leave him well off. His ultimate goal, he said, is to sell the licensing and name rights to a manufacturer who can produce thousands of high-quality bags annually.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been polishing this jewel for 20 years,'' he said. ''The real value it has is if someone licenses the name, the reputation and the design, and already has the distribution and production in place.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Truran is not, however, seeking a licensee, but just answering the phone each time it rings with the distant hope that such a person might be on the other end. Even if he isn't, Mr. Truran doesn't mind. For now, he said, business, and life, are fine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm in a good spot,'' he said.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 -- Hector V. Barreto, the head of the Small Business Administration, defended his agency's response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes on Thursday on Capitol Hill, saying the agency had responded ''quicker to this event than any in our history.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But amid evidence of growing backlogs and high rates of rejection in the agency's disaster loan program to businesses and homeowners, Democrats attacked his performance.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued a scathing statement accusing Mr. Barreto of offering small businesses in the gulf region ''only hurricane-force spin,'' rather than real assistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials and business organizations have complained that the agency has approved only a small number of low-interest business loans -- fewer than 3,000 as of Dec. 13, according to the agency's own data. Almost 7,000 business loan applications have been rejected, and more than 27,000 are pending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog is far larger for homeowners who have applied for loans. The New York Times reported on Thursday that more than 175,000 applications -- almost two-thirds of those the agency had received -- had not yet been processed. More than 81 percent of the applications that have been processed were rejected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To support his argument that the agency had moved quickly to respond to the hurricanes, Mr. Barreto said at a news conference that his agency had approved $1 billion in loans just as fast as it had in 1994, when the Northridge earthquake struck Southern California. But some critics of the agency contend that computer processing has improved significantly in the last decade, adding that the agency was slow back then, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he has in the past, Mr. Barreto attributed the agency's high rejection rate to the high poverty levels in the areas struck by the hurricanes. ''We're being as lenient as possible within the limits of our authority,'' he said of the loan programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto said 80 percent of loan applications were from people who did not want to borrow money, but who had to be rejected by his agency before they could seek additional grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA referred more than two million families to Mr. Barreto's agency based on the incomes they reported when they registered for federal assistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto made his comments at a news conference called by the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, Representative Donald Manzullo, Republican of Illinois. Critics of the Small Business Administration were actually dissatisfied, Mr. Manzullo said, because it offered loans, which must be repaid, rather than grants.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the speed of the loan process, Mr. Manzullo pointed to the agency's experience in New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when businesses complained of a slow pace in lending ''despite the fact that S.B.A. workers went out of their way to provide assistance.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But twice as many of those businesses defaulted on their loans as in previous disasters, Mr. Manzullo said, so if loans are made quickly ''and you try to satisfy complainers, you have a huge default rate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House committee, repeated her call for Mr. Barreto to resign. ''This administration has failed small businesses across the country and particularly at a moment of crisis,'' she said at a separate news conference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Velazquez criticized what she said was the agency's decision to change its computer system just before the hurricane season began, and also its promotion of a loan program offered through banks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce issued a statement on Thursday defending Mr. Barreto, saying that ''politically motivated attacks leveraged against Administrator Barreto undermine the hard work of a dedicated public servant.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMAZON, Walmart.com and other online retailing giants have always had upstarts nipping at their heels. But the little guys are starting to bite harder.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how sharp their teeth are, however, is a matter of some debate.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the $26 billion in sales that are projected for Internet retailers this holiday season, about 45 percent will go to small retailers, according to Forrester Research, up from 42 percent last year. Even so, with revenues starting to flatten at eBay, the site so many of them use to market their wares, some analysts doubt they will ever be able to break through the 50 percent mark.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other analysts are not so sure. In the fast-changing world of Internet commerce, they say, smaller merchants have gained two important advantages: Google and consumers who are fussier than ever.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The game has changed,'' said Gene Alvarez, an analyst with Gartner, a technology consulting firm.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In years past, any retailer could put up a Web site fairly easily, although it had little chance of attracting the attention of Web browsers unless it had enough money to advertise on well-known sites like AOL and MSN. Yahoo and Amazon, which have long sold cheap Internet storefronts to small businesses, sweetened the deal by listing the businesses on their sites in return for a sales commission.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that exposure, while significant, pales in comparison to the publicity Web merchants can now gain by spending a few nickels per click on a text ad on Google. ''Before, people couldn't find these smaller guys,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''But now these stores can be much more easily discovered on Google.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, consumers are displaying a growing appreciation for small online retailers. According to the Kelsey Group, a media consulting firm, the portion of Internet searches that include local elements like ''dry cleaners and Greenwich Village'' or ''art galleries in Easton'' has doubled in the last year to 20 percent.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for that, no doubt, is the spread of high-speed Internet connections, which allow users to click through multiple merchants without waiting hours for Web pages to load.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which leads to another phenomenon that could further threaten the dominance of the big players -- simplified e-commerce software with the potential to lure hordes of hitherto reluctant merchants onto the Internet.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to eBay, nearly 650,000 small businesses in the United States have an online presence, a sizable figure but a tiny fraction of the 7.5 million companies that the Kelsey Group estimates market most of their goods directly to consumers. Many of the holdouts have resisted the Web because they deem the transition to be too difficult, too expensive or both. But now, Yahoo Stores, ProStores from eBay, NetSuite and other companies that help businesses operate online hope to change the minds of the hesitant with software and services that are cheaper and easier to use.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're moving into the next generation for small and medium-sized businesses who want to sell online,'' said Mr. Alvarez of Gartner. ''Even a one-person shop can open an online store that's much more refined than it would've been a few years ago.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liz Herbert, a Forrester analyst, said the biggest change in e-commerce software in the last few years was that it no longer comes in a box. It is delivered online, so businesses do not need technology specialists to install and run the company's system.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EBay has for years offered sellers the chance to set up their own ministores, called storefronts, in this fashion, but the company this year intensified its efforts to reach small businesses that might not be interested in selling solely on its site. In January, it bought Kurant, an e-commerce software company, for an undisclosed sum; this year it renamed the service ProStores and upgraded the software with added features.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Chris Tsakalakis, eBay's senior director of stores and platforms, the ProStores service, which costs from $7 to $250 monthly, gives sellers templates to use in setting up a store, and will carry an online catalog of 10 items or more. For those who pay $30 or more a month, the service includes a personalized Web address, a secure checkout process and a selection of more sophisticated business tools, like those that help managers improve the store's rankings on search engine results.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such software tools sound like an obvious place for Google's engineers to focus, particularly if the company wants to attract more local businesses online so they will buy more Google ads. But Google -- which last month began giving away software to help Internet managers analyze their site traffic, but has not otherwise pushed into e-commerce services -- does not offer live customer service, and this is one market where such service is critical, executives said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have hundreds of live agents that are highly trained, answering questions around the clock,'' said Rich Riley, vice president and general manager of Yahoo Small Business. ''That gives us a real head start.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And increasingly, these services include more than just the ability to post a Web site and accept transactions. NetSuite, a privately held company co-founded by Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, and Evan Goldberg, one of Oracle's chief technologists, has improved its tools for companies that want to manage their entire business -- including payroll, shipping and marketing -- through the Internet.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some retailers, like Mess Makeup, a New York seller of cosmetics, that is the most important feature in the latest incarnation of e-commerce services. ''I could go to the Bahamas, pull out my laptop, look at inventory, see how many leads came in, track people's shipping, and everything's extremely user-friendly,'' said Adam Furman, a former software consultant who co-founded Mess Makeup two months ago.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Furman, who pays NetSuite about $1,000 a month for one of its more sophisticated service offerings, said he would have had to spend $500,000 to $1 million to develop the same technology on his own a few years ago. ''And we would've needed to hire a tech team of our own,'' he said. ''Now we can concentrate more on just selling makeup and building our business.''    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DONALD J. TRUMP, bargain hunter?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the idea behind the latest venture from the real estate mogul, reality series star and failed airline executive, who recently re-entered the travel industry with GoTrump.com, an agency that promises bargains on airfares and hotels, and includes vacation tips from (of course) the Donald himself.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from providing a high-profile experiment on the possible limits of celebrities in e-commerce, the site points to the state of the online travel agency industry, which despite its best efforts remains the place where people click around endlessly to save $10 on a $300 ticket.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GoTrump offers, among other things, ''affordable luxury'' vacation deals, like a nine-day South African trip for $2,000 per person, that are listed as being exclusive to the site.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't matter how rich you are,'' said Mr. Trump as he sat in his Fifth Avenue office, accompanied by five highly attentive staff members and public relations representatives. ''You don't want to be a fool and you want to get the best deal. But people who aren't rich want to associate with rich, and that's why this thing has become so crazy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump contends that the site has already attracted many customers -- a claim that independent research firms were unable to support, given how new the site is and the fact that its traffic is not yet heavy enough to measure on the scale of its competitors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the offerings on the site are priced at rock bottom. GoTrump offers ''Trump Picks'' for hotels he personally recommends, like the Fairmont San Francisco, the Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and, naturally, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump said he would offer the site's users exclusive access to deals at his hotels, although no such offerings were yet available. He also predicted that private jet operators would offer ''huge discounts'' on his site so they could avoid returning empty to their originating airports.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too much future tense, analysts argue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, it's a bunch of promises,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Forrester Research and the former marketing director for the ill-fated Trump Shuttle, an airline Mr. Trump owned between 1989 and 1992. ''There's a lot between the conception of an idea and the long-term execution of this,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''But that said, I don't think he's expecting much. This won't generate more than a few million in revenue every year.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing GoTrump has going for it, Mr. Harteveldt said, is good technology. But for that, the site can thank another online travel company, the Sabre Group site Travelocity.com. Like other major online travel agencies, Travelocity licenses its search and booking technology to thousands of smaller sites, who receive a undisclosed commission for each booking they make on Travelocity's behalf.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sites like GoTrump.com customize the look of the site and add other flourishes to distinguish themselves and generate more revenue, while avoiding the cost and inconvenience of a huge customer service operation, which Travelocity mostly handles. (The telephone agents identify themselves as GoTrump.com representatives.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Trump dismissed the idea that the site was just another vanity plate meant to pump up the Trump brand. ''I didn't do it for that,'' he said. ''It's going to be a very successful company.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, Mr. Trump argues that the combination of his technology (mainly the presentation of the site) and that of Travelocity moves it ahead of competitors. ''When Priceline came out, the technology wasn't what it is now, and I don't think they've kept up,'' he said. ''We will keep ahead of it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this low-stakes poker match, Priceline's chief executive, Jeffery H. Boyd, saw Mr. Trump, and raised. ''Our products have changed and grown more than any other business in this space over the last couple of years,'' he said. ''Just 30 days ago we launched a completely new look and navigation.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Boyd said, GoTrump.com ''offers functionality from companies that have been in business for a long time, so I haven't seen anything there I'd identify as new technology.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor does Travelocity see GoTrump as much of a competitor, said Dan Toporek, a Sabre Group spokesman. Rather, he said, GoTrump could bring Travelocity thousands of customers who might otherwise stray to competitors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever the multitasker, Mr. Trump said he would use his other media assets and activities to promote the GoTrump brand. The fifth season of ''The Apprentice'' is nearly complete, he said, but he expects to weave GoTrump.com into season No. 6. Likewise, Mr. Trump has already promoted the Web site on his daily radio program, a series of minute-long monologues heard on about 400 Clear Channel stations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really believe in traditional advertising, and we'll start doing that, but right now, it's almost like there's not that much need for it,'' Mr. Trump said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GoTrump.com represents something rare for the Web these days: novelty. Other celebrities have promoted Web services, but until now, no stars have put their names on commercial Web sites of this scale, selling items they recommend, said Heidi Messer, president of LinkShare, a New York-based company that helps Web site publishers market goods. This so-called affiliate-selling approach is popular among lesser-known experts in categories like cooking, who will suggest cookbooks to buy on Amazon or other sites and receive commissions of between 5 percent and 15 percent on the ensuing sale. But Ms. Messer said: ''It's shocking to me that there aren't more celebrities doing this.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Messer says that celebrities frequently have many loyal followers who visit their Web sites, and who are happy enough to buy products that the stars endorse on television commercials, magazine ads or billboards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the Web, you can say 'These are the products I like and I'll get a commission on the sale if you buy them,' '' Ms. Messer said. ''If you've got the brand and are driving people to your site, why not monetize that?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason celebrities have not tried this yet is that ''people haven't thought there's money in it,'' Ms. Messer said. ''But these people have access to offline media and can drive lots of people online. It's precisely what puts AOL in such a terrific position.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump seems to follow the calculus. ''When you get millions of people using your service, and you get X dollars per person,'' he said, ''it adds up to be a lot of money.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A YEAR ago, galvanized by studies showing that the number of minority-owned businesses was increasing rapidly nationwide but still faced basic problems like borrowing money, a coalition decided small-business owners needed help to grow and prosper.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit group in Kansas City, Mo., dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship, joined with the National Urban League and other organizations -- with an endorsement from the White House -- to create the Urban Entrepreneur Partnership to give minority businesspeople advice and training needed to overcome financial and other obstacles.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the Entrepreneur Partnership was setting up one-stop small-business help centers in several cities, the southernmost being Atlanta, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated as many as 80,000 Gulf Coast businesses, many of them minority-owned companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We couldn't just go on with the original plan and ignore what was going on in New Orleans and the area around it,'' said Daryl Williams, the Kauffman Foundation's director of minority entrepreneurship.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When Katrina hit, people asked us about what we were going to do to help those entrepreneurs,'' he said, ''but we had not thought about it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Williams got in gear. Within weeks, he went to New Orleans, where he was shaken by the ''unprecedented and demonic horror on the Gulf Coast,'' and the daunting conditions for those who had lost their businesses and sometimes their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two more visits to the region, Mr. Williams went back to Kansas City and drew up the Katrina Urban Entrepreneur Partnership, borrowing from the core program but tailoring the new one to the needs of hurricane-affected small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kauffman Foundation is to start the program this month, giving needy entrepreneurs intensive help to ensure that they get part of the cleanup and reconstruction work on the Gulf Coast. Concerns have been raised that minority-owned companies are not getting a fair share of the posthurricane business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have got to connect these people -- and some of them have lost almost everything -- with experienced coaches who can help them,'' Mr. Williams said. The foundation is renting office space in New Orleans, bringing in professional business coaches on a rotating basis and identifying federally certified minority enterprises -- beginning with demolition, construction and rebuilding businesses -- that can benefit from such assistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such business owner is Byron Stewart, 49, whose architectural firm, Byron J. Stewart &amp; Associates, in the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans, was flooded. He and his family fled Katrina, and he returned to find the first-floor office of his Victorian-style frame house under four feet of water. His residence upstairs was undamaged, but Mr. Stewart had to start his 15-year-old business almost from scratch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only reason he has a business at all, he said, is that he grabbed his computer hard drive and his laptop as he left. But his business is limping along. Finances are at the point, he said, ''where it's scary,'' and he's not sure whether he can pay the bills and himself and his four employees, who have been working from their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even though he has inquiries about architectural commissions, he said he was cautious because he wanted to create a business plan that would help him weather future economic downturns. In 2004, a stagnant economy in the New Orleans area caused his revenues, usually about $850,000, to dip substantially, by $300,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now there are plenty of jobs because of the amount of work that needs to be done,'' he said, ''but I am going to take a slower approach because I want to grow my business for the long term.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reach his goal of generating $2 million in yearly revenues, Mr. Stewart said he would open his financial records to one of the Kauffman Foundation's coaches, who, among other tasks, will help him analyze them, create a cash flow and evaluate which projects can be profitable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kauffman project also plans to connect minority entrepreneurs like Mr. Stewart with large established businesses that are not necessarily in the Gulf region but could help them form joint ventures and partnerships to bid on federal and private contracts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get the effort going, Kauffman is committing up to $1 million this year to help as many as 1,000 businesses, and expects that Louisiana economic development authorities and national groups like the Business Roundtable, a group of about 160 chief executives of major corporations, will donate top expertise and financial assistance to the Katrina Urban Entrepreneur effort.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have businesses down in the Gulf which might have two or three trucks,'' said Kermit Thomas, a consultant to the Kauffman Foundation, ''but contracts that require 200 to 300 trucks. So we are trying to use the existing U.E.P. offices to find companies in their areas to pair up with businesses in New Orleans and the Gulf which have the experience and know-how, but who don't have the resources to be able to bid successfully on a contract.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what Keith Tillage, of the Tillage Construction Company in Baton Rouge, La., hopes to do. The business he runs and owns with his father, Kevin, was not wiped out, but like many businesses in the area, it is confronted with the disappearance of established clients and the post-Katrina era confusion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tillage said he welcomed the ''intrusive'' coaching, which will most likely come from Michael Dayton, a lead Kauffman coach who will give him frank advice on every aspect of his business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, such advice has already led Mr. Tillage to pass up bidding on a large contract to provide trailers for housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was tempting because it was serious money,'' he said, ''but then they asked us, 'Do you want to be in the trailer maintenance business 10 years down the road?' And we know that's not where we want to be.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dayton, a former chief financial officer for a community development organization, said his goal was to help Tillage, which now employs seven workers, ''to build its capacity to deliver and develop strategies to find clients.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will sit down with them, side by side,'' he said. ''They have a business to operate, so it could take a year or more, but we want them to be in this for the long run.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- PATRICK FITZGERALD found himself distracted as he studied for the bar exam at Fordham University five years ago. New York City was debating the merits of continuing its recycling program and Mr. FitzGerald wondered why that was a question at all. ''I wasn't an overt tree-hugger, but I thought it was odd,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He began poking around Web sites and news articles about the economics of recycling, and concluded that one of the industry's biggest problems was motivating its suppliers -- the people who generate garbage.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moral obligation -- or even compassion for trees -- was not enough to induce good recycling habits, Mr. FitzGerald decided. Instead of spending money on campaigns to persuade people to recycle, he thought: What if you paid them directly? What would happen?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2002, he talked about the idea with Ron Gonen, a high school classmate and fellow Philadelphia-area native. Before long, the project swallowed up their lives and maxed out their credit cards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. FitzGerald quit his job at a Wall Street law firm, moved back into his mother's attic in suburban Philadelphia and began working the phones and Internet search engines, making contacts in the solid-waste industry and finding retailers who were willing to participate in a customer rewards program. Mr. Gonen, then in his first year in the M.B.A. program at Columbia University, put in late nights writing a business plan and software, becoming ''more and more involved and obsessed.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their teamwork led to the birth of RecycleBank (recyclebank.com) in early 2004. The logo is a piggy bank whose hind end is a recycling bin, embodying consumer incentives and environmental consciousness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process seems elegantly simple. Households get credit for the weight of materials they recycle, which is scanned and recorded through a computer chip embedded in the garbage bins when they are picked up by the sanitation crew. They exchange that credit for coupons at various businesses. Municipal officials save disposal fees. Recycling companies make more money from processing. Retailers gain the feel-good association with a socially beneficial activity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RecycleBank charges municipalities (or private haulers, depending on the arrangement) $24 a household, and guarantees clients that they will save at least that much in disposal fees as waste is diverted from landfills and incinerators. The company also receives revenue from recycling plants, depending on how much it increases the amount of materials that are processed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought the idea had tremendous merit right from the start,'' said Clifford J. Schorer Jr., who helped mentor Mr. Gonen in his position as entrepreneur in residence at the Eugene M. Lang Center for Entrepreneurship at Columbia. The university contributed $100,000 to RecycleBank's seed money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents participating in RecycleBank can check their ''balance'' online and cash in their coupons -- a maximum of $25 a month, $400 a year -- at several dozen national chains like Starbucks, Home Depot and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The Coca-Cola Company set up a Green Community Fund, where coupons can be donated to environmental education programs in the Philadelphia public schools and public libraries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its start last year in Philadelphia, RecycleBank also established relationships with local businesses like the Chestnut Hill Cheese Shop and the Reading Terminal Market, where about 25 specialty vendors accept the coupons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem for the RecycleBank was trying to find a way to measure the volume of recyclable goods generated by a household and credit that amount to participants. Through Web searches and phone calls, the men identified Cascade Engineering in Grand Rapids, Mich., which provided free several thousand 35- and 64-gallon bins embedded with RFID (radio frequency identification) technology as part of its research and development budget.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''smart waste'' tag, a combination computer chip and bar code, enables the bins to be scanned and weighed and the amount linked to a household. The information is channeled from an on-board computer in the garbage trucks into a databank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LTS Scale Corporation of Twinsburg, Ohio, was able to configure scales and a tipping mechanism for the containers, which fit on the back of the trucks so the bins can be weighed and easily emptied.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why not cheat by adding a bowling ball or other heavy nonrecyclable items to the trash? RecycleBank came up with a button on the on-board computer that workers can press to flag the address if they notice contraband. This happens ''less than rarely,'' Mr. FitzGerald said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both men, who are 30 years old, decided early on that it was important to spare households the tedium of separating glass, paper, plastic and metal. They signed on with the Philadelphia-based Blue Mountain Recycling, which uses sorting technology employing fans, gravity, magnets and manual picking.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RecycleBank persuaded Philadelphia officials to allow it to conduct a pilot project involving 2,500 households in two Philadelphia neighborhoods, upscale Chestnut Hill and modest West Oak Lane. Six months later, 90 percent of the households in both neighborhoods were participating, up from 35 percent in Chestnut Hill and 7 percent in West Oak Lane -- averaging 25 pounds a week of recyclables per home. The city is considering whether to contract for the service and extend it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project's success has helped Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Gonen to sell the RecycleBank program to several municipalities in the mid-Atlantic and New England regions. Officials in Wilmington, Del., will begin a RecycleBank plan with an initial 4,000 households on April 1.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's largest expansion occurred when Blue Mountain was acquired by Casella Waste Systems in Rutland, Vt., in September. Casella plans to introduce the RecycleBank program to 100,000 households in New England next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gonen said the fast start had been exhilarating, but added, ''I'm very focused on putting on the brakes when they need to be put on.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 1997, when Chip Tooke and other principals sold the mental health services company Value Health, he went home, seized a shovel and began digging up the front yard of his home in Virginia. Relieved to be away from his desk, Mr. Tooke, 52, spent a year landscaping his property. Then, in 1999, he started a second company, Lumenos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being an entrepreneur gets in your blood,'' he said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumenos, based in Alexandria, Va., grew from Mr. Tooke's idea that people would spend their health care dollars more wisely if they benefited from their own thrift. The company sells what he calls ''consumer-driven health care,'' including health savings accounts. Lumenos was one of the first companies to sell these accounts to large firms as an employee benefit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. Tooke sold Lumenos for $185 million to WellPoint, the health care benefits company. Bound to the new owner for 30 months, he is already thinking of concepts for his next venture.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's how it is with serial entrepreneurs: they create one company after another, and everything else is just tossing dirt. They do it, Mr. Tooke says, because they ''like to go fast.'' They ''like simultaneously building a company, tailoring products to changing markets and selling,'' he said. They do it because they love the highs and lows of the game.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, money matters, too. It is the way serial entrepreneurs keep score, and only those with good track records can continue to attract investors. Still, for many the contest counts as much as the trophy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this respect serial entrepreneurs are quirkier and more restless than other entrepreneurs. Many possess a mishmash of technical, marketing, leadership and people skills -- a combination that sets them apart. Their bounty of talents and experience make them valuable role models to anyone thinking of starting a business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some serial entrepreneurs tolerate risk; others revel in it. Bill Ward, 52, is on the far end of the risk continuum. An inventor and physicist -- like many serial entrepreneurs, he has no advanced degree -- Mr. Ward has been dreaming up new technologies and starting companies on Route 128, Boston's technology highway, for 25 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each new business, Mr. Ward said, he has operated ''right at the edge of financial ruin.'' None of this is a problem, he says nonchalantly, because ''pressure and risk bounce off my forehead'' -- which is good because his career has had plenty of both, especially at the beginning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1982, Mr. Ward and two partners founded Ion Beam Technologies, in Beverly, Mass., a maker of ion beam systems for the semiconductor industry. Within a year, the trio had become embroiled in a vicious fight with their investors, the result of not knowing how to choose financial partners or structure a relationship with them. After 18 months, Mr. Ward said, the investors told them ''to take their technology and get out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ward and his partners ''ate peanut butter and jelly for a few months,'' he said. Then, in 1984, they applied their ion beam technology to a new company, Micrion, in Peabody, Mass. They took the company public in 1995, and merged in 2002 with its chief competitor, the FEI Company in Hillsboro, Ore. Shortly afterward, he left FEI, selling his stock at a large profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within months, Mr. Ward obtained seed money to underwrite research on his invention, the helium microscope, and began raising money for a new company. In 2005, he founded the ALIS Corporation to make ultra-high-resolution helium microscopes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says that one of his strengths is his ability to roll with the punches, ''a natural skill shared by all humans,'' he said. ''People can adapt to anything.'' If more people knew how adaptable they are, he added, ''they might drive themselves to achieve more.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven years ago, Sunil Paul, 41, was an engineer working for America Online in Vienna, Va. His unvested stock options were worth a million plus, but he could not wait to collect on a sure thing. A sense of urgency was ''clawing'' at him, he said, so he quit his job. He had an idea for Web-based software that would speed the process of downloading content from the Internet. So he and a partner, also based in northern Virginia, started Freeloader, a Web site that took off fast. Less than a year later, sensing that hype rather than true momentum was driving their company's rapid rise, they sold out to Individual Inc., a news collection service, for $38 million. ''You can't drink your own Kool-Aid,'' Mr. Paul said of the decision to sell. Within months, the company's technology was outdated. If he had waited to sell his business -- as did his major competitor -- he would have lost out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Paul, who moved to Silicon Valley, has devoted himself to inventing new ways to use technology and starting new ventures. ''I had to prove that I wasn't just lucky,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, he founded Brightmail, a company that made anti-spam software for corporate clients. The idea for the company was based on Mr. Paul's hunch that spam would spread from personal to business computers. His company received $55 million from venture capital firms; the money was used to improve the software. When spam bombarded the business world hard around 2001, ''We had the best product,'' Mr. Paul said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, he hit the jackpot for the second time when he sold Brightmail to Symantec for $370 million. He said that Brightmail's software has become ''an integral part of Symantec's e-mail security product.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Mr. Paul, having struck the big money twice, retire and buy a nice big boat? Not likely. He is already working on ideas for other companies. ''People like me are driven to do something, plus make money, in that order,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paul's money-isn't-everything assertion is echoed by many serial entrepreneurs, especially those whose companies are based on their own inventions and ideas. Still, no one denies that the money matters. ''It's how we keep score,'' Mr. Paul said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much money does it take to make you a winner in the game? Kenneth Morse, director of the Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, estimates that the figure for having enough is about $10 million -- a lifetime annual income of at least $500,000 -- enough to buy a second home on the water, perhaps a boat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernie Aronson, 75, has been starting and running small companies for 30 years. Mr. Aronson, who was trained as an electrical engineer, said his early business ventures were based on his own inventions. In recent years, he said, he has worked as a Silicon Valley ''hired gun,'' someone brought in to help small tech companies grow and eventually go public. In 2004, he became the chief executive at Kilopass Technology Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif., company that sells the intellectual property used on microchips.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before that, Mr. Aronson was the chief executive of Synplicity Inc., a software manufacturer in Silicon Valley, where he managed the company's successful initial public offering in 2000. He was president of Epic Design Technology, another Silicon Valley software company, when it was sold to Synopsys for $440 million in 1997.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Aronson owned 4 percent of Epic and could have stopped right there. But as long as he is able to work, he says, he never intends to retire. ''Why would I stop?'' he asked. ''I don't have any other interests in life. This is what I like to do.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, he says, he has mastered the rules of the game. ''I used to lose sleep worrying,'' but not anymore. Instead, he has learned to assemble a first-class team, to focus on creating a superior product and to pour his energy into competing harder and smarter than the competition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, even in the fast-paced world of high tech, old-fashioned virtues still matter. ''In this business integrity counts for a lot because you keep doing business with the same people,'' Mr. Aronson said. ''It's why customers buy from you and it's one reason venture capital people keep investing.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADISON, Wis. -- WHEN a new business fails, most entrepreneurs know precisely what to do: get up, dust themselves off, and get on to the next thing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if a start-up succeeds?  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, of course, is a good problem to have, but for many entrepreneurs, it's a problem nonetheless. The idea works -- it is a bona fide business. Yet now what? Expand and run it? Hand it off to a professional manager? Sell it and start something new?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheri and Stuart Meland are asking such questions and, in the process, are learning a lot about themselves as entrepreneurs. In July 2002, as graduate students in sociology at the University of Wisconsin here, they started madcityhomes.com, a flat-fee residential listings service for home sellers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $399, the company places an advertisement for the owner's home on the Multiple Listing Service, a computerized homes-for-sale network affiliated with the National Association of Realtors, which gives the listing wide exposure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their business is one of hundreds of insurgent start-ups across the country trying to grab a piece of the $60 billion in commissions that real estate agents collect each year. These new companies offer alternative, often cheaper, services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers on madcityhomes.com can sell directly to a buyer and pay no commission, which about 40 percent do. The rest sell to a buyer represented by a real estate agent and pay the agent a standard 3 percent of the sale price. The latter group saves, though, by paying the Melands $399, instead of the additional 3 percent that sellers typically pay a listing agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Melands -- Sheri is 28, Stuart is 29 -- have been successful, listing 60 properties their first year, 210 the second year and 433 last year, with $170,000 in revenue from listings for 2005. Their costs -- putting up yard signs, advertising, phones and supplies for their home-based business -- are very low. They have paid off student loans. Their house, bought in 2003, is just months shy of being paid for. ''I am notoriously frugal,'' Mr. Meland said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their original goal, he said, besides financing their graduate studies, was to prove a point. The couple felt that it should not cost 6 percent to sell a house, and that many sellers would prefer to pay less for do-it-yourself service. Point proven. Their success felt good, too, since their earlier effort at an Internet start-up failed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Melands are far from bored with madcityhomes.com. But the exhilaration of not failing is now replaced by the incremental joy, and labor, of signing up more clients. On some days, working out of their tidy ranch house near the university, the Melands wonder if they should be doing something else. ''I'm at a loss,'' Mr. Melands said. ''Other projects have sort of had their own life span.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Meland concurred. ''We're certainly on the cusp of deciding what we want to be when we grow up,'' she said. At the least, she wants to hire someone to replace her and go back to finishing her Ph.D. So they debate: should they expand, hire some help, maintain the business as it is or sell and focus on studies? The biggest obstacle preventing her from returning to school, she said, is her overinvolvement in the business. ''I tend to micromanage,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Melands are not alone. During the first stages of success, start-up founders ''basically end up having to decide whether they're going to be consumed by their own business,'' said Thomas C. Kinnear, professor of entrepreneurial studies at the University of Michigan Business School. Many are not the right people to carry a company forward. ''A lot of these people who stay wreck their own business,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, start-up entrepreneurs often lack the temperament to share decision-making as their business grows, said Steven Neil Kaplan, professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. ''You're taking it from a company where you can make all the decisions to one where you have to delegate,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Melands make a great team -- Stuart sets strategy and Sheri puts those decisions in play. Could madcityhomes.com prosper with one of them running it? ''I appear to be constantly in charge,'' Ms. Meland said. ''I have to tell him where to go. But he makes most of the big decisions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither of them expected to run a business. Ms. Meland's dissertation, researched but not yet written, is about the impact of attractiveness on income and other elements of success. She tracked down the yearbooks for 3,000 residents who have participated in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, an analysis of 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957. She arranged for people in the subjects' age group to rate their attractiveness using a system she created to limit subjectivity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has never been done,'' said Ms. Meland's faculty adviser, Jeremy Freese, an associate professor in the department of sociology at the University of Wisconsin. ''Everybody knows attractiveness matters, but how you go about measuring it has been very difficult. The whole project displays an enormous amount of initiative.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Meland, who wants to be a professor, has a personal interest in her topic. When she was in middle school, she was plump, with big glasses. ''A boy in seventh grade literally spit in my face,'' she said, recalling that he said: '' 'You're the bottom of the food chain. I don't want to talk to you.' ''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, she said, ''I went through a transformation in eighth grade. I lost weight and got rid of my big glasses. All of a sudden, all the boys were interested in me. I had a lot of power.'' In high school in Chicago, she said, ''I was the cute geek the popular boys were interested in.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she never gave her heart to a boy. ''Until I met Stuart,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They met as undergraduates at Grinnell College in Iowa. On their first date they walked around talking all night, stopped at her place at 4:30 a.m. for a blanket and sat outside to watch the sun rise. ''He moved in with me 10 days later,'' she said. ''We completely clicked.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former English major, Mr. Meland said he wanted to be a writer. He said he has written four unpublished books of fiction, and is working on an outline for a series of historical novels. He also observes businesses he encounters, wondering how they might be better run. ''Ever since I've been a kid, I've been searching for self-actualization -- trying to prove myself,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2002, when Ms. Meland was eight months pregnant with the first of their two sons, the couple were looking at houses to buy. ''I don't think we'd ever had a positive experience with a real estate agent,'' Mr. Meland said. At dinner one night, he told her about his idea for madcityhomes.com. ''She went for it right away,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the business grew, they suspended schoolwork, and their compulsive tendencies drove it on. On the day Ms. Meland gave birth to their first child at 2:55 p.m., she was returning business calls by 7 p.m.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he gets little sleep, Mr. Meland said, he still writes, though most of his energies go to the business. ''It comes out of the same desire as to write books -- that creative urge,'' he said. ''This is too great an opportunity just to let it founder. I should take it as far as I can take it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the business is at a crossroads. ''Sheri wants to hire someone tomorrow,'' he said. ''I'm a little superstitious. My first inclination is to just take on more work myself.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is only so much time. Ms. Meland's Ph.D. isn't moving forward. ''When the kids have gone to bed, and I'm done returning phone calls, I'm too tired to do it,'' she said. ''Stuart is more the -- I don't want to say chip on his shoulder -- maybe wanting to show people. Maybe it's a guy thing. For me, anyway, I'm not out to prove something.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should they sell? ''Most people who start a business need to cut their ties to it at some point,'' Mr. Meland said. ''That way I'd get some closure. But I don't see that happening anytime soon.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE old story of technology in business was a trickle-down affair. From telephones to computers, big companies came first. They could afford the latest innovations, and they reaped the benefits of greater efficiency, increased sales and expansion into distant markets. As a technology spread and costs fell, small businesses joined the parade, though from the rear.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that pattern is being challenged by a bottom-up revolution, one fueled by a second wave of Internet technologies like the search services from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft and software delivered as a utilitylike service over the Web.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-generation Internet technologies -- combined with earlier tools like the Web itself and e-mail -- are drastically reducing the cost of communicating, finding things and distributing and receiving services online. That means a cost leveling that puts small companies on equal footing with big ones, making it easier for upstarts to innovate, disrupt industries and even get big fast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon is a big step in the democratization of information technology. Its imprint is evident well beyond business, in the social and cultural impact of everything from blogs to online role-playing games. Still, it seems that small businesses, and the marketplace they represent, will be affected the most in the overall economy. Long-held assumptions are suddenly under assault.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORTUNE BELOW 500 -- One truism has been that while small businesses represent a huge market -- companies with fewer than 500 employees, the government reports, account for half the nation's economic output and 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs -- it is highly fragmented and hard to reach.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So big companies typically shunned the small-business market, and Silicon Valley start-ups tended to sidestep it, instead devising business plans focused on either the consumer or the large-corporate market. But Salesforce.com, which supplies customer tracking and management software online, has shown how to create a thriving business by selling first to small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our company was based on building momentum from the bottom up, and using the Web as we do drastically reduces the cost of sales and service,'' said Phill Robinson, senior vice president for marketing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the company has more than 18,000 customers and sales of more than $300 million a year. Its only problem seems to be growing pains, as the company's network went down a couple of times in the last two months. Many start-ups are trying to follow in the footsteps of Salesforce by offering software as an online service to reach smaller companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I.B.M. makes its living catering to the costly needs of its Fortune 500 clientele. But last year, it began offering small businesses Web-based software services like filtering for e-mail spam and viruses, starting at less than $2 per employee a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I.B.M. could not afford to touch this market years ago,'' said James M. Corgel, general manager of services for small and medium-size businesses. ''But as we automate more, we can afford to sell to the small-business market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREATING MORE GAZELLES -- Students of small business have often noted that the most economically significant companies are the ''gazelles,'' small businesses that become dynamic fast-growing companies. The new Web-based technologies could foster a proliferation of gazelles, stimulating job creation and wealth across the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In principle, this should lower barriers to the entry and growth of innovative small enterprises,'' said Frederic M. Scherer, an economist and professor emeritus at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That principle is being widely practiced these days. Take the example of Bella Pictures, a three-year-old business in San Francisco. Its goal is to transform the enterprise of wedding pictures from a local craft of mixed quality into a national business of consistently high quality and personalized service. It has grown rapidly, and last wedding season, May through October, Bella shot photographs at 1,300 weddings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bella's 150 freelance photographers and 50 consultants in a dozen cities are linked in a virtual network. Every job, assignment, bride and mother-of-the-bride preference is entered into a Web-based customer relationship management program. Bella markets itself by buying keywords, like ''wedding photography,'' on search engines like Google and Yahoo to bring customers to its Web site, bellapictures.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bella solicits photographers on Craigslist, the online bulletin board, and photographers submit portfolios through the Web, too. All photographs are taken with digital cameras.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology behind Bella, said Tom Kramer, the president and a founder, has become available and affordable only in the last few years. Sophisticated customer- and job-tracking software, he said, used to be available only as million-dollar software applications, with hefty annual maintenance fees. Today, its Web-based equivalent is a pay-for-use service from Salesforce, which costs Bella a couple of thousand dollars a month. Web searching, online listings and the spread of digital photography, he added, are all crucial tools for Bella.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our business wouldn't have been possible five years ago,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE GROWTH ON TAP -- The new technology is also giving small businesses the freedom to pursue new strategies. Brooklyn Brewery, founded in 1988, took a new path less than three years ago. The company wanted to build its beer into a larger regional brand. So it sold the trucks and storage facilities that it had used mainly in the New York area, and hired independent distributors to deliver its beer up and down the East Coast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To become a regional business, the company wanted most of its employees to work outside Brooklyn, promoting its beer in new markets. It invested about $20,000 in a computer network so that its 15-person sales force, spread from Massachusetts to Georgia, could tap in from notebook computers for information on everything from sales leads to poster art for tavern promotions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy has paid off. Sales at the 27-person company have grown nearly 30 percent over the last couple of years to about $10 million in 2005, said Eric Ottaway, the general manager, who expects sales to rise about 15 percent this year. The growth has come without adding to his four-person administrative staff, Mr. Ottaway said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn Brewery farms out the maintenance of its computer network to a services company, Quality Technology Solutions of Morris Plains, N.J., which typically works for larger businesses. But it can make money on a smaller account like the beer maker because of the Internet and features that Microsoft has added to its Small Business Server software, which enables remote updating, troubleshooting and bug fixes, said Neil Rosenberg, president of Quality Technology Solutions. Mr. Rosenberg's experts can now monitor and tweak the brewery's computers from New Jersey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So I don't have to schlep a technician to Brooklyn for 80 to 90 percent of the problems,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I.B.M., the giant of the technology services business, is not sending consultants to Cole Harford in Overland Park, Kan., either. Last year, Cole Harford, a distributor of restaurant supplies like napkins and plastic cups, started using a couple of I.B.M. Web-based software programs that monitor Cole Harford's e-mail for spam and viruses, blocking malicious code from reaching its 75 desktop and notebook personal computers. The service has been remarkably effective, said Laurel Johnson, the information technology director at Cole Harford, and it costs less than $5 a month per user.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, Ms. Johnson said, she and an assistant used to spend two days a week wrestling with virus and spam troubles. Today, those problems take only four hours a month of her time, so she is planning to finally tackle a long-delayed project to automate the company's four warehouses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROVIDING A SECOND WIND -- The new Web technologies have also given a second life to languishing small businesses. Until a few years ago, the Newark Nut Company, a retail and wholesale vendor of nuts, candy and other snacks, was struggling in a declining urban neighborhood. But in 2003, Jeffrey Braverman decided to leave behind his six-figure salary at a private investment company in Manhattan and help revive his family's business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Braverman pushed the business online, studied Web marketing and bought keywords on search engines. Since then, the company's employment has tripled to 12 people, Mr. Braverman said, and sales have tripled into millions of dollars a year. The business, now called Nutsonline.com, recently relocated to Linden, N.J.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Search technology, he said, can really open the door to wider markets for small companies. Far-flung customers can find a company's products, while keyword advertising makes marketing more specific and affordable. ''It's just been phenomenal what Google has done for our business,'' said Mr. Braverman, who is 25.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller businesses have now taken the lead in spending on information technology. Small and medium-size businesses -- those with fewer than 1,000 employees -- account for half of all spending on hardware, software and services in the United States, and their spending grew 35 percent faster last year than the overall market, according to IDC, a research firm. That trend, said Ray Boggs, an IDC analyst, is expected to continue for the next few years as small businesses become more eager and adept at using new Web technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JotSpot is a Silicon Valley start-up betting on the small-business market. It offers collaborative work spaces online where people can share and edit Web-based documents and databases for project management, help desks, recruiting, product development and other tasks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JotSpot calls them ''do-it-yourself applications.'' Anyone can create up to 20 Web pages shared by five people, at no cost. For more pages and larger groups, the monthly fees start at $9.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sweet spot for us is small businesses up to 200 people,'' said Joe Kraus, a co-founder and the chief executive of JotSpot. ''The rise of software as a Web service, combined with search marketing, has totally changed the economics of supplying and selling technology to small businesses.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the special Small Business section on Tuesday about Y Combinator, a venture capital firm that runs a boot camp and provides seed money for start-up companies, misstated the amount of equity it takes in them. The partners collectively own 1.2 to 12 percent of the start-ups, with an average of 6 percent -- not an average of 6 percent per person.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Feb 23 2006   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT 26, Phil Yuen's identity lay somewhere between Dilbert and a Microserf. His office, on the first floor of Building 16 on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., did not have a window. Not to worry. ''I could see the window from my manager's office,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yuen was a midlevel manager who wrote specifications for enterprise project management software -- giant computerized flow charts. ''I drew boxes and lines to help other people draw boxes and lines,'' he said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then one night last spring, he was sitting in his apartment, surfing the Web. He went to Slashdot.org (''news for nerds'') and saw an article that Paul Graham, the essayist and guiding light of computer programmers, was establishing a start-up company, later called Y Combinator, which would be giving seed money to hackers to start businesses. The word ''hacker'' is not derogatory in the computer world, but it is someone who is creative and resourceful with code.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like Rob De Niro wants to start an acting school,'' Mr. Yuen said. ''Do you want to join it? You get to work with him every week, you might even get a small little movie deal out of it at the end.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graham, a 41-year-old dimple-cheeked entrepreneur who sold his company, Viaweb, to Yahoo in 1998, had developed a large following for his lucid and contrary essays in a geek community more comfortable expressing itself through programming code than coherent paragraphs. Among his essays, ''How to Start a Startup'' is a siren call, resonating with Gen Y programmers pondering quarter-life crises and with college students too inexperienced to be jaded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the establishment of Y Combinator, more than 200 teams, with two to four people a team, applied in just a few days for eight slots announced by the new company, which operates in Mountain View, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being accepted, Mr. Yuen and his team established two start-ups in the last seven months: one he gave up on; the other, called TextPayMe, is a service that sends cash payments to an online account through text messaging -- akin to PayPal but using a cellphone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Yuen was in Mountain View, in the heart of Silicon Valley, demonstrating his product to venture capitalists and other tech entrepreneurs. At a Y Combinator dinner, he asked Evan Williams, a co-founder of Blogger, who was a guest speaker at the event, for his cellphone number and then sent him $2 using TextPayMe. (Mr. Yuen, incidentally, has now accumulated a trove of cellphone numbers of Silicon Valley heavyweights and offers from three venture capital firms.) Mr. Williams, intrigued, mentioned he had the same idea earlier that day while brainstorming with friends. ''It's something in the air,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night, at the dinner, Mr. Williams addressed a room full of refugees from Oracle, AOL, Microsoft and Accenture. ''I think this is so cool what you guys are doing,'' said Mr. Williams, who sold his company to Google in 2003. ''I would love to be part of something like this. I'm so jealous.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is possible to systematize the archetypal two guys in a garage (and they are generally guys), the year-old Y Combinator wants to do it. The company's formula is to throw smart people together and provide them $6,000 in seed money per person to cover the initial costs of the company, cookie-cutter legal paperwork and an extensive network of business contacts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, Mr. Graham and his partners -- Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris -- collectively own 1.2 to 12 percent of the company, with an average of 6 percent a person. The company holds two boot camps a year for about eight groups each session, a summer one in Cambridge and a winter one in Mountain View. Y Combinator is not so much an incubator as a hatchery for baby companies, and as with all things spawned in bulk, some will die, some will flourish and some will eke by.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Y Combinator comes down to two kids in a room with two computers and ramen noodles for a summer,'' said Chris Sacca, a principal of new business development at Google and a speaker at Y Combinator's one-day start-up school conference in October at Harvard. ''It takes ambitious geeks and puts them in a situation with no distraction and expects audacious outcomes from them. The reason we like it is that that is what Google is.'' Indeed, Google has made acquisition overtures to one of the companies that was formed during the summer session, which the founders turned down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graham got the idea for starting Y Combinator after giving a talk to student entrepreneurs at Harvard, where he received his Ph.D. in computer science. He told them to look for seed money from rich people they knew, preferably ones who had made their wealth from technology. ''Then I said, 'Not me,' and they all looked kind of downcast and then I felt like a jerk,'' he said. Then, on reflection, Mr. Graham thought, why shouldn't he try to support young hackers?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal for Y Combinator's young entrepreneurs is twofold: to make something people want (which is the company's motto); and to stretch their financing long enough for additional investment or to get acquired. For instance, Mr. Graham's former company, Viaweb, which made software to build commercial Web sites, was bought by Yahoo and reborn as store.yahoo.com. One Y Combinator business created last summer, a company that uses cellphones for social networking, got financing from a venture capital firm. Two other Y Combinator companies, a calendar Web site called Kiko.com and a news site, Reddit.com, received additional angel financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Y Combinator relies on certain premises: that open-source software and falling hardware prices means that tech start-ups are cheap to finance; that large companies are no longer at the forefront of innovation; and that mature technology companies find it cheaper to buy than to build.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company takes its name from an obscure mathematical term, describing a function that generates other functions. Y Combinator is a company that creates other companies -- a sly reference that would elicit a smile from a very narrow set of people, but luckily the same set that the company is trying to appeal to. It is the philosophical triumph of the passionate computer hacker over the uptight M.B.A.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Paul is telling us, 'If you are having a good time, and you are building something that other people want, then the money is not going to be a problem,' '' said Beau Hartshorne, 24, whose vision for a company he is calling Pixoh will allow people to resize and crop their photos within a Web browser.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graham is more focused on creating cool products -- that is, coding as art -- than developing revenue models and protecting intellectual property. Thus, Y Combinator may not be as good at teaching participants how to build self-sustaining companies than it is preparing them to sell, or flip, their businesses. For Silicon Valley corporate war chests, acquisitions are often made for technical talent as well as product, which generally has to be rebuilt if it is kept at all. The whispered acquisition rate for companies is about $1 million to $2 million per technical employee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a way for recruiting for Yahoo where you don't have the risk and uncertainty of knowing if they can actually do something,'' said Joel Spolsky, a technology entrepreneur in New York City who also has a wide readership on the Internet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The danger is that you will run out of money before a buyer shows up,'' said Peter Rip, a managing director of Leapfrog Ventures, a venture capital fund in Menlo Park, Calif. ''We are seeing a lot of guys being attracted to the ease with which they can start a company, but starting is really only the first step.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a financial standpoint, the Y Combinator investments are small in a world where valuations are measured in millions of dollars, if not billions. ''In the traditional venture capital model, $6,000 isn't enough to pay your corporate lawyer fees for your first financing,'' said Mr. Sacca of Google.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just about the money,'' said Jeff Mellen, 24, who quit Oracle with three of his friends to build an operating system that works within a Web browser.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Y Combinator provides the validation that young techies should keep pursuing their dreams. ''I could get the same amount of money from my parents, but that wouldn't tell me if my business plan or idea was a good one,'' Mr. Mellen said. ''That tells me my parents love me.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR small-business owners who use patents, these are challenging times.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the United States Patent and Trademark Office, where a surge in new technology applications has resulted in an enormous backlog, critics charge that examiners are overburdened and undertrained, lacking the expertise to separate the innovative wheat from the chaff. This has led to patents of dubious quality, critics say, and an increase in patent infringement claims, often against small companies that cannot afford to defend them.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, bigger companies are often disparaging the claims of smaller companies, sometimes ignoring them altogether.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Donald E. Stout. He helped found NTP, a small Virginia patent-holding firm that is suing the giant Research in Motion, or R.I.M., for patent infringement relating to R.I.M.'s BlackBerry device.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although a federal appeals court upheld most of NTP's infringement claims last year, R.I.M. has not settled the case. Instead, it is doing a lot of lawyering and public-relations work, continuing to challenge the patents in administrative proceedings, and opposing an injunction sought by NTP to shut down BlackBerry operations on the ground that it would constitute a national disaster. That request is under consideration by a district court.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Guibert, a vice president for corporate marketing at R.I.M., denied that it was trying to outmuscle its smaller adversary. He questioned the NTP patents and NTP's ''reasonableness,'' adding that ''R.I.M. respects intellectual property'' and has ''licensed thousands of patents'' from small companies whose patents were deemed valid and whose terms were acceptable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Stout is not buying this argument. He describes the conflict with R.I.M. in David and Goliath terms, defending NTP's reasonableness and its patents, which were obtained for work done years ago by Thomas J. Campana Jr., the other founder of NTP, who has since died.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Big companies play the odds, and historically they don't license patents from small ones,'' Mr. Stout said. ''If you are a small business and want to enforce your patents, you are going to have a hard time.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are big companies that pay to use patents owned by smaller ones; Nokia, for one, has bought licenses from NTP. And some large companies can be generous with their patent portfolios, like I.B.M., which has announced a program to provide low-cost patent access to certain start-up companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cases, small industrial businesses are vulnerable to companies holding patents they rely on. In these situations, firms like NTP seem less like David and more like Goliath. These small investor groups, known derogatively as patent trolls, acquire patents, seek payment for their use and sue those who will not pay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Hangartner, a San Diego patent lawyer, said that many small companies fear litigation and therefore pay, even if they question the patents. To them, he said, the licensing businesses are engaging in nothing more than legalized extortion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a widespread feeling in the small-business community. But it is not, Mr. Hangartner said, universal. ''There are others, inventors, who view patents as a way of protecting themselves against exploitation,'' he said. ''The whole area is really complicated and loaded with value judgments.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patent and trademark system is founded on the notion that intellectual property is just that -- property, said Jon W. Dudas, the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. He defended patent licensing. ''We celebrate land speculators and stock sellers,'' he said. ''There are inventors who want to license their inventions, and we should recognize this, too.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A record 400,000 patents were issued last year, Mr. Dudas said. Struggling to cope, the Patent Office has been under fire for what critics call inordinate processing delays and for a decrease in patent quality and specificity that has eroded the ability of businesses to assess the merits of contested patents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dudas, who conceded that there had been financing and staffing shortages, said that his office now had about 4,500 patent examiners, more than ever, and that they were getting better training. The office is also receiving more money as a result of a measure passed by Congress, allowing the agency to keep and use the fees it generates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that has not been enough, and Congress is considering more permanent changes, said Herbert C. Wamsley, executive director of the Intellectual Property Owners Association, a trade group. His organization advocates legislation that would change the patent filing system from a ''first to invent'' to a ''first to file'' system, like that used throughout much of the world, and create an effective way of contesting a patent's validity early on.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such measures could go a long way toward alleviating many headaches now afflicting small businesses. But they offer little comfort to small companies, generally manufacturers, whose intellectual property woes relate not to patent infringement but to its more harmful cousin, counterfeiting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Uniweld Products, a Florida manufacturer of refrigeration, heating and ventilation goods. Many components of its products are patented, both in the United States and abroad, and their design and packaging are trademarked. Yet the company's sales in Saudi Arabia have fallen victim to knockoffs from China, said David S. Pearl II, Uniweld's executive vice president. The problem is spreading to countries nearby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It took us 30 years to develop a market in the Middle East,'' Mr. Pearl said. The company's ability to keep that market is now questionable, he added, with enforcement of the company's rights in foreign courts a difficult proposition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a sad experience,'' he said. ''And it's happening to a lot of companies besides us.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new business owners the frustration is real, not a bad dream. It comes when they find out how much time and paperwork are involved in a payroll and all the tax filings.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That often requires long hours after a day's work, looking up the federal and state income tax withholdings for each employee, calculating the withholding for Social Security and Medicare taxes and then writing a check and recording the information in an accounting journal. And if an employee works overtime in the next pay period, everything must be recalculated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next are trips to the bank to deposit the money that was withheld and filling out the tax forms. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that business owners spend 14 hours each quarter on tax filings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There must be a better way. For computer users, there is: PayCycle, or paycycle.com, a secure online service for small businesses that automates the payroll and tax-reporting processes. It costs $14.99 to $42.99 a month, depending on the amenities, but new customers can try it free for one month and pay $9.99 for an additional two months' tryout.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's great; PayCycle is fantastic,'' said Michael Katz, president of RAE Internet, a company in New Rochelle, N.Y., best known for its subsidiary, Message Partners, which provides e-mail security service, including antivirus, antispam and antiphishing protection for business servers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just so easy,'' said Antonio Bojorquez, the financial coordinator and business manager for Murray Dental Care in Cupertino, Calif. ''It's like being at a good restaurant that has excellent service because there is always someone there. You get e-mail reminders on tax filings, employee payments, etc. The program is very comprehensive in keeping track of what you need to do when you need to do it and reminding you.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bojorquez said that PayCycle had been recommended to one of the dentists in the practice by a friend, a business manager who had researched the matter thoroughly and become an enthusiastic customer. The dentist, in turn, told Mr. Bojorquez about it, and he now uses it for an 11-person payroll and related tax work. The employees are paid by direct deposit and receive e-mail notifications with check stubs available for printing from a secure Web site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are ways to handle payroll and tax filings other than Bob Cratchit-style ledgers or PayCycle, and both Mr. Katz and Mr. Bojorquez have tried them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Katz said he had been a customer of Automatic Data Processing, the industry leader in payroll, tax and benefits services, but it took many phone calls to process each payroll and approve the checks, and it cost much more for a small business than PayCycle. He can go online at any hour from any computer, taking care of the payroll for his seven employees in minutes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bojorquez said, ''I have about 30 years in management in many industries.'' He has handled manual systems as well as relied on outside services like Automatic Data Processing. At Murray Dental, he first used a paper payroll system and outsourced the tax work, entering the data it provided into QuickBooks. The move to PayCycle has saved several hours a month as well as money. ''It's added a couple of thousand a year to the bottom line,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PayCycle, which was founded in 1999, is based in Palo Alto, Calif. Most of its founders came from Intuit, which is best known for its TurboTax, Quicken and QuickBooks software. Financing for the company has been provided primarily by venture capital firms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen White, vice president for product management at PayCycle, said there were 5.7 million businesses in the United States. That includes giants like Exxon Mobil and General Electric, but 5.1 million of those businesses have fewer than 20 employees, and those businesses are PayCycle's market. So far, it has 20,000 customers in all 50 states.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our mission is to make paper-based payroll obsolete,'' Ms. White said, adding that many people started a business with little knowledge of bookkeeping and tax requirements and discovered how demanding these chores are after they got going.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PayCycle's service is meant to be low-cost and easy to use. It provides direct deposit for employees with secure online pay stubs, although users can cut paper checks for employees who want them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also has links to software that small-business owners often use, including QuickBooks and Microsoft Money, to avoid re-entering data. The security is the same as that used by leading banks and brokerage houses for online transactions, Ms. White said.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While preparing for the arrival of their first baby five years ago, Michael and Ellen Diamant came to a realization that hits many design-conscious parents: diaper bags, bottle warmers and nipple racks don't fit into their decorating scheme.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clunky industrial shapes that have not changed in decades, bland white plastics and teddy bear motifs simply clash with granite countertops and a stainless steel coffee machine, Mr. Diamant said.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As entrepreneurs, the Diamants had stumbled on a market opportunity. Like a growing number of small-business owners, they felt they could crack a competitive market by adding a splash of cool to traditionally bland consumer goods. ''We decided to take products that are under the radar and turn them into objects that are beautiful to look at,'' he said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting on demand from like-minded parents, the Diamants three years ago founded a baby-gear company, Skip Hop. They started with a line of messenger-style diaper bags that now grosses several million dollars a year. This summer, with the help of the award-winning product designer Scott Henderson, they will branch into baby bottle racks, diaper caddies and jar organizers. His designs -- boldly curved and brightly colored in glossy blue and pink -- look more like Design Within Reach than Babies ''R'' Us.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the large companies that dominate most consumer goods sectors stick to safe looks that test well with broad audiences, entrepreneurs say they can attract a following by taking a little more risk with bolder designs. And their products command premium prices.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When a market is governed by a large industry, small entrepreneurs have to come in at a higher price,'' said Karim Rashid, a prolific designer who has lent his futuristic look to everything from Prada cream tubes to Sony Walkmans. Requests for his services from small-business owners, he says, have soared in the last few years. ''The only thing they can compete with is the experience of the product itself,'' he said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These businesses range from husband-and-wife partnerships like Skip Hop to booming start-ups with contracts at major chain stores.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simplehuman, for example, a kitchen gadget maker founded five years ago in Los Angeles, has $80 million in sales annually through a slick line of dish racks, pedal-operated trash cans and paper towel dispensers available everywhere from Crate &amp; Barrel to Target.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to take the most mundane thing that nobody cares about and innovate on it,'' its chief executive and founder, Frank Yang, said. ''So we started with the trash can.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designers say Simplehuman revolutionized the dish rack industry two years ago with its award-winning stainless steel and frosted plastic version. Competitors have since scrambled to update their offerings.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, exceptional design has always helped sell merchandise; entrepreneurs like Steven P. Jobs of Apple and Philip H. Knight of Nike have built empires by getting creative with laptops and athletic shoes.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, until recently, most company executives cared more about how much a product would cost to manufacture or how long it would take to ship, says Michele Caniato, head of Culture &amp; Commerce, a consulting firm that pairs designers with companies. The names of designers rarely came up in board meetings.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has changed in the last five years, says David Martin, North American head of brand consultancy for Interbrand.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners are starting to catch on, and securing lucrative shelf space in unexpected store aisles. For example, Method, a manufacturer in San Francisco, used updated packaging to break into the competitive world of detergents.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at household cleaners in the market, you'll find that every bottle has the exact same silhouette,'' said its co-founder and co-chief executive, Eric Ryan, describing an industrial shape plastered in garish ad copy reminiscent of the 1950's. ''They're not bottles you'd want to leave out by the kitchen sink.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To set themselves apart from competitors like Procter &amp; Gamble and Clorox, Mr. Ryan and his partner, Adam Lowry, commissioned Mr. Rashid to create minimally labeled curvy clear bottles filled with candy-colored liquids. They made dish soap look more like perfume.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts credit the kitchen tool maker Oxo, now a thriving subsidiary of Helen of Troy, for introducing modern design to America's supermarket aisles. Oxo started 15 years ago when its founder, Sam Farber, designed vegetable peelers and jar openers that would spare his wife's arthritic hands. At the time, many doubted that shoppers would spend $6, or triple the market rate, for a kitchen tool meant to be replaced every few years.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oxo represented an entirely different model,'' said Perry Reynolds, head of marketing at the International Housewares Association. ''Consumers said 'I've been buying these things every couple of years for a while, and I finally want to get a good one.' ''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Farber focused more on ergonomics, he also raised the aesthetic bar with his distinctively rounded black rubber handles and red trimmings.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, other entrepreneurs have followed his example by improving on the look and feel of the most utilitarian tools: Modo, a company in Oregon, makes medical equipment carts with curved lines and red wheels that evoke Italian strollers. Bright green and orange neoprene bottle totes from Built NY won a design award in 2004.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies are still an exception, but the trend is gaining momentum. Technological advances, for example, are making it easier to realize even the most complicated designs. Outsourcing gives entrepreneurs without factories access to the tools of mass production.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with fewer rules and decision makers to slow them, small businesses can cater to changing tastes more quickly. While Procter &amp; Gamble might spend two years testing a new dispenser, Method had its bottles for sale within six months after hiring Mr. Rashid.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing tastes are another factor in new design. Shoppers want objects that not only look cool, but that also speak to them.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Design is a communicating device,'' says Kristina Goodrich, executive director of the designers' society. ''It can tell you how to pick up a stapler; it can show you how to not to touch something that's hot.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these heavily designed versions of everyday items are easy to spot, defining them is another matter. Experts say well-designed products are heavy on ergonomic comfort and light on superfluous, or purely decorative, detail. But there is also a more elusive quality that some refer to as the ''Wow'' effect.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For entrepreneurs, that effect comes at a price. Method's founders were able to afford Mr. Rashid -- one of the world's most expensive designers -- by giving him an equity stake and a four-year contract.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, most heavily designed products are more expensive.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Skip Hop's bottle racks, at over $30 each, will cost more than double the price of a more pedestrian design. But Mr. Diamant says the popularity of the diaper bags proves that shoppers are willing to spend a little extra to escape the teddy bear motif. ''People like that one step up in luxury.''    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BANGALORE, India, March 19 -- Twenty young engineers, mostly from the Indian Institute of Technology, India's premier technology school, peer into computer monitors in the no-frills office of Read-Ink Technologies, a start-up company housed in a small building in the bustling Indiranagar neighborhood of this city.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bangalore's flourishing outsourcing companies, including Infosys Technologies and Wipro, have attracted worldwide attention with their global clients and tens of thousands of workers. Less known are the many technology start-ups, like Read-Ink, that have taken root here in recent years.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new firms are drawn by the region's big pool of engineering graduates, many of whom have expertise in esoteric new technologies. That advantage, coupled with labor costs much lower than those of Silicon Valley, is starting to turn Bangalore, long a center for lower-end outsourcing services, into a center of higher-end innovation.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these firms are self-financed, others have capital from the West. Some are run by foreigners. Others are founded by Indians, including returnees from overseas.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Read-Ink, one of the self-financed operations, is developing an advanced handwriting recognition software that can read scanned forms, claim forms, medical records and even digital tablets.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its founders, Thomas O. Binford, a retired computer science professor from Stanford University, and his wife, Ione, a former manager at Hewlett-Packard, arrived here four years ago with five suitcases. They say they are now close to signing up their first business customer.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs of this shift toward high-value work are becoming more visible. Executives at Silicon Valley Bank, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and provides consulting services to technology and venture capital firms, said they were seeing twice as many Indian start-ups looking for capital investment than even a few months ago.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our technology and private equity clients are leveraging India at an unprecedented rate,'' said Kenneth P. Wilcox, chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank and SVB Financial Group.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the members of the Bangalore chapter of the Indus Entrepreneurs, a nonprofit network for entrepreneurs, collaborated with the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson Gotham to sponsor a business plan competition last month, they were stunned to draw 125 entries vying for the $150,000 top prize.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Bangalore is becoming a hunting ground for venture capitalists looking for promising investment opportunities, such as Promod Haque, managing partner at the venture capital firm Norwest Venture Partners in Palo Alto, Calif.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 percent of Norwest Venture's portfolio companies, or about 20 companies, have development operations in India, mainly in Bangalore. ''More and more people are figuring out that Bangalore is a critical step in making start-ups capital-efficient,'' Mr. Haque said, explaining that cost savings here can help stretch initial investment funds.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haque is taking a hybrid approach to investment. He pairs entrepreneurs of Indian origin who have returned to India (many have spent time working in Silicon Valley and elsewhere) with Western executives who have marketing and management expertise.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his investments is Open-Silicon, a two-year-old silicon engineering company. Its chief executive is based here, but its headquarters and marketing chief are based in Sunnyvale, Calif. ''Like Open-Silicon, which has most of its customers within a five-mile radius of its headquarters, many technology start-ups are servicing American and European markets,'' Mr. Haque said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indrion Technologies, another new Bangalore start-up, has six engineers working on embedded semiconductor solutions for sensor-control networks. Its co-founder and chief executive, Uma Mahesh, a computer science engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology, is optimistic that he can attract venture capital because innovation among India's new companies is ''a very believable story for investors.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps not surprisingly, this increased start-up activity in Bangalore has caught the eye of influential American lawmakers. Many American political and business leaders have said they are worried about a technological brain drain from the United States to places overseas.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Jerry Lewis, a California Republican who is the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that he was trying to find a government agency to sponsor projects in areas like nanotechnology, semiconductors, energy and pharmaceuticals, and possibly to collaborate with agencies in India.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are figuring out what kind of support and funding is needed from the Congress,'' Mr. Lewis said in a phone interview, adding, ''The issue is not so much about losing innovation leadership as it is about how to make innovations happen on a cheaper scale and how to make more of it happen.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Bangalore can be an incubator city for start-ups is demonstrated in Read-Ink, which the Binfords have financed entirely from their savings and retirement fund. They live and work in the same building, saving on rent. The ground floor contains a kitchen and employee dining room as well as the Binfords' bedroom and employees' guest rooms.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Binford also runs an all-night accounting back-office service for American customers. ''It is a small service with seven accountants,'' she said, ''but helps cover the costs.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving the accuracy of handwriting recognition beyond what currently marketed software products offer is a complicated technical problem. ''Current products have an accuracy rate of 80-85 percent; ours will be a 5-7 percent improvement,'' said Mr. Binford, Read-Ink's chief technology officer.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in getting there, the Binfords have struggled to recruit and retain the best engineers in a competitive market. They said they had deliberately stayed in stealth mode for fear of talent poachers.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other growing pains. Finding venture investors at the early stages of a start-up business can be difficult because the majority of investors prefer to make safer later-stage investments. There is also a lack of homegrown innovators serving as role models.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The entrepreneurial heroes of the Valley are accessible to many people,'' said Sabeer Bhatia, who moved from Bangalore to the Silicon Valley and co-founded Hotmail, later acquired by the Microsoft Corporation.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sridhar Mitta, president of the Bangalore chapter of the Indus Entrepreneurs, said, ''We are not going to be another Valley anytime soon,'' but he added, ''The city can match up with Boston or Austin as a competitive place to start up innovative product companies.''    </p>

The survey's index, compiled by the Center for European Economic Research, fell to 62.7 points in April, from 63.4 points in March. While expectations in April were probably helped by an increase in new orders, they ''may have been negatively influenced by the risk of a general slowdown of the world economy and the high oil price,'' the research center said. The survey, a leading indicator for the German economy, has been slipping since it reached 71 points in January. The center, which is based in Mannheim, interviewed 316 analysts and institutional investors for the survey.  </p>

Barreto, the embattled head of the Small Business Administration, said on Tuesday that he would resign and take over a Hispanic advocacy group that has supported some of President Bush's initiatives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto, who had run the agency since 2001, said he had not been asked to resign but had decided that ''this was the perfect time'' to change jobs.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House immediately announced plans to nominate Steven C. Preston, a business executive in Chicago, to take over the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration was sharply criticized in the months after Hurricane Katrina as taking too long to handle disaster loans to homeowners and companies trying to rebuild.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times reported in December, more than three months after the hurricane, that the agency had processed only one-third of the 276,000 applications it had received and had rejected 82 percent of those it reviewed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the agency says it has greatly accelerated its efforts and has now made decisions on about 90 percent of the applications and approved about $8.5 billion in loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics of the agency contend that problems remain. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, told lawmakers last week that the agency had been unprepared for a major disaster and was almost ''purely in a reactive state.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency was also criticized last year for making disaster loans in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that were not closely related to those events.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto's departure comes in the midst of a broader reshuffling in the Bush administration, which is struggling with low poll ratings, widespread unhappiness about rising energy prices and an economic agenda that has become stalled in Congress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of that reshuffling accelerated this month after Joshua B. Bolten took over as Mr. Bush's chief of staff. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, gave up his formal responsibility as domestic policy adviser last week, and Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's chief spokesman, announced plans to step down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Donald Manzullo, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Small Business Committee, praised Mr. Barreto's efforts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Under Hector's leadership, the S.B.A. streamlined many functions and learned to do more with less while facing unparalleled challenges to the S.B.A.'s disaster loan program,'' Mr. Manzullo said Tuesday in a statement, adding that Mr. Barreto had cut costs by $100 million a year by eliminating subsidies for the agency's major loan-guarantee program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democratic lawmakers were much harsher. ''He was simply not up to the challenges of running this agency,'' said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House small business panel. Ms. Velazquez had called for Mr. Barreto's resignation in December and said Tuesday that he had ''made the right decision'' to step down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto, in a brief telephone interview, said he was proud of his tenure and that his resignation had nothing to do with the criticisms of his agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he would lead the Latino Coalition, a small advocacy group that has been largely backed by Hispanic business executives and has lent support to some of Mr. Bush's initiatives. Last year, for example, members spoke out warmly in favor of Mr. Bush's plan to overhaul Social Security and let people put some of their payroll tax contributions into individual investment accounts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston, who must be confirmed by the Senate, is a senior vice president of the ServiceMaster Company, a multibillion-dollar corporation whose businesses include TruGreen ChemLawn, a lawn care company; and Terminix, a pest control company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Mr. Barreto, whose family owned a restaurant in Kansas City, Mr. Preston has spent nearly all his career with large corporations.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computers can be a source of great power -- and frustration -- for operators of small businesses. Here are new technology tips that can address both ends of that spectrum.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLOCKWISE -- As smart as computers are, they know only what people tell them. And apparently no one has filled them in about a change to daylight saving time next year, the first change since 1986, when PC's were just starting their invasion of the workplace.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daylight time will start three weeks sooner, on March 11, and end a week later, on Nov. 5, to comply with a broad energy plan signed by President Bush last August. Most PC's and servers are set to automatically leap forward on the first Sunday in April and fall back the last Sunday of October. If they are not reprogrammed, their internal clocks, and the software programs that use the clocks to do things like manage calendars and schedule money transfers, will remain an hour behind during that period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts are calling the change a ''mini-Y2K problem,'' because it reminds them of when computers had to be reprogrammed to recognize the two and the first zero in ''2000.'' That characterization both potentially exaggerates and underplays the problem, said Raymond Boggs, an analyst at the research firm IDC.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparison exaggerates because fixing the problem will not require nearly as much labor as Y2K, for which programmers had to comb through millions of lines of software codes in decades-old programs. But the warning should not be seen as a false alarm, either, just because computers greeted 2000 without much fuss.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luis H. Rodriguez, a director of market management at I.B.M., which began offering software to fix the problem on March 31, agreed. ''This is by no means Y2K,'' he said. But, he added, ''if you don't think this is a big deal, go ahead and test it. Change your servers by an hour and see what happens.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He does not recommend that anyone actually take him up on that dare, but he and other experts do advise companies to start looking at software systems that automate the distribution of software fixes, called patches, including those that change clock settings. Patch management systems are generally used to protect against new security threats, and they can simplify the process of resetting clocks to spring ahead in March instead of April and fall back in November instead of in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microsoft includes a basic version of such software, called Automatic Update, with the Windows operating system, allowing it to push updates to consumers over the Internet. It plans to deliver an update for its clocks in the next months, a company spokeswoman said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MY RADAR -- Chance encounters are the lifeblood of small companies. Networking opportunities are everywhere: on the bus, at the store, at your child's soccer game.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Jambo Networks is trying to increase the odds of serendipity. It is offering a kind of Wi-Fi radar that helps people find and communicate with potential customers and business partners who are close by.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Ribaudo, a co-founder of Jambo, said that entrepreneurs had an advantage over workers in big corporate buildings because they often work from Wi-Fi hot spots in public spaces like Starbucks, allowing for more interaction. ''All you have to do is let Jambo be on the lookout for those you want to meet, and it will then notify you about them when they are nearby,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jambo is similar to software like Dodgeball, which is for dating. With Jambo, you enter a profile with your business interests, and the software alerts you whenever someone with matching interests logs in within six blocks of your location. You can then exchange instant messages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jambo can be used offline as well, allowing users on the same airplane, for example, to trade messages directly, without using the Internet. It will soon add the ability to find missed connections -- people who were in the same place at different times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jambo can be downloaded free from jambo.net. The company makes its money from licensing its software to social networking sites, business associations and universities, Mr. Ribaudo said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WATCH OUT, DATA THIEVES -- Here is a statistic that may surprise you: Instances of identity fraud have actually dropped in the United States in the last three years, to roughly 8.9 million from 10.1 million in 2003, says a new study by Javelin Strategy and Research.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven J. Cole, president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, which commissioned the study, said the improvement could be traced partly to better consumer awareness. The report found, for example, that 69 percent of consumers now shred documents that contain personal information.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big companies have also been strengthening defenses since data breaches at financial operations like ChoicePoint, CardSystems, Visa and several big banks. They are trying to cut the odds that data is exposed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the council is concerned that small companies are not keeping pace with these practices. It has released a guide, ''Security and Privacy, Made Simpler.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought that small businesses posed different kinds of issues,'' said Alan F. Westin, who wrote the council's guide with Lance J. Hoffman, a professor at George Washington University. Small companies, Mr. Westin added, ''don't have H.R. departments, don't have C.I.O.'s and often don't even think about privacy and security as an issue they have to pay attention to'' because they think they are too small for data thieves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The free guide, which is available at bbb.org/securityandprivacy, emphasizes low-tech methods, including Dumpster diving and mailbox theft, and also covers topics like phishing, in which defrauders pose as a bank or the like, seeking your information.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, American companies are flush with cash. That has led many economists and policymakers to predict that an upsurge in business investment will smooth the sharp edges of the next economic slowdown. The thinking goes like this: As consumers retrench in the face of higher gas prices, higher interest rates and staggering household debt, companies will pick up the slack by spending their accumulated fortunes on equipment, technology and factories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such thinking may turn out to be more wishful than wise. Corporate America has been piling up cash for some time, yet business spending has not been particularly robust. It's not in the doldrums, but it's not on a tear, either.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And instead of investing, many companies are choosing to distribute their cash to shareholders. The preferred method for doing so, by far, is to buy back the company's own stock. Buybacks benefit shareholders because they reduce the number of shares outstanding. That, in turn, boosts the earnings per share, and generally the price, of the remaining shares.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported this week that in the year ending on March 31, companies spent a record $367 billion in stock buybacks, an extraordinary amount. And, The Journal reported, the torrid pace of buybacks is expected to continue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's nothing wrong with returning money to shareholders. But companies generally do so only when they can't find a better alternative. In general, buybacks are an indication that there are no investments on the horizon that represent a superior use of the company's money. Another downside to buybacks is that they can give a false impression of corporate performance. Higher earnings per share are generally thought to result from real improvements, like higher sales. But buybacks can enhance the stock price -- and thus mollify unhappy investors -- without increasing overall earnings. So, on the one hand, buybacks are a sign that good investments may be lacking. On the other, they can give investors the impression that the good times are rolling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mixed signals are to be expected when the economy is in transition, as it is now. What's important for policymakers is to avoid complacency that comes with thinking there's a silver bullet -- like business investment -- for escaping the worst potential effects of a slowdown.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statewide, the situation for dairy farms, which make up 85 percent of Vermont's agriculture, has gotten so tough that on Monday, the federal Department of Agriculture declared the entire state a disaster zone, making cheap emergency loans available to farmers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Gov. Jim Douglas convened an emergency ''dairy summit'' on Thursday, announcing that the state would give farmers $8.6 million in cash assistance because the situation was so dire that federal help was not enough. ''I refuse to let the agricultural industry of Vermont slip away,'' Mr. Douglas, a Republican, said at the summit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, the governor said: ''A number of farmers have lost over half their crops, and we estimate about $53 million or $54 million in reported losses. It's part of our culture, our way of life. They are the stewards of the land, and they maintain the working landscape that's so important to our natural beauty and our tourism. I believe this is a particularly critical time for them, and that's why we need to do everything we can to help them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually every dairy farmer has been affected.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just been so wet that we couldn't do anything,'' said Henry Magnan, who milks 550 Holsteins with his four sons in Fairfield, where rain has twice flooded his street (Chester Arthur Road, after the president who spent his infancy here) and made it impassable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For weeks, the fields have been so wet that the Magnans, members of a dairy cooperative that supplies the milk for Ben and Jerry's ice cream, could not plant corn to feed their cows. Some 85 acres of hay they had also counted on became so moldy, rotten-smelling and infiltrated by mushrooms that the Magnans had to chop it up and let it molder on the ground. Tractors trying to work their land are getting mired in mud.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this will mean mounting costs to buy feed they would have grown, said one son, Mark Magnan. And assuming they get a crop of hay and corn later in the summer, the quality will be poorer, which will cause cows to produce less milk to sell and require farmers to buy protein to supplement the poor feed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add to that the price of fuel, which increases the cost of operating tractors, transporting milk to market, trucking in supplies and even using fertilizer made from natural gas. With milk prices low, the Magnans said they had been recouping only about $11.50 of the $15 it cost them to produce 100 pounds of milk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most dairy farmers weren't exactly rolling in cash when these problems started,'' said Matt Harvey, who milks 140 cows in Florence. ''A lot of us are living off of our reserves or at least tapping into them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of dairy farmers has been declining in Vermont and elsewhere for years, with small family farms selling to larger ones and young people opting out of agriculture. But Robert L. Parsons, an economist at the University of Vermont, said the current situation seemed particularly difficult, with more farms folding this year than before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there has been no decline in the number of cows or the amount of milk produced, Professor Parsons said a decline in dairy farmers had hit the state hard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vermont is the most dairy-dependent state in the country,'' he said. ''People say the top five agricultural products in Vermont are dairy, dairy, dairy, dairy and dairy. This image of the independent small farmers grazing their cows on the hillside, is that a disappearing picture? Many of the people are afraid that it is.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmers trying to keep their business afloat have taken a variety of steps. Some have shifted to producing organic milk, which draws a higher price but also requires an investment of time, money and land that not every farmer can afford.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few are going the route of the Blue Spruce Farm in Bridport, which has found a way to wring greater value out of a commodity it produces in abundance: manure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm extracts methane gas from the manure and sends the methane through a generator, which makes electricity. The Central Vermont Public Service Company sells the electricity to customers for 4 cents per kilowatt hour more than regular electric power (which sells for 11.4 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers), and the farm pockets the 4 cents. So far, about 3,000 customers have signed up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie Audet, part of the family running Blue Spruce, said there was another benefit: removing the methane also removes that classic manure smell, so ''the separated manure solids can be used as bedding for the cows instead of sawdust.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Douglas said one of his wife's brothers, Robert Foster, had augmented his dairy income by selling potting soil made from manure. ''He calls it Moo Doo,'' the governor said, ''and it's sold up and down the East Coast.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many farmers are struggling to make the economics work. Harvey Smith, a state representative, sold the cows on his farm in New Haven, Vt., a few months ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Fay, who milks 200 Jersey cows in Maidstone in northeastern Vermont, where fields have been swimming in rain, said he was taking austerity measures: cutting fertilizer use and giving up some power in his tractor by ''shifting up a gear so you don't burn as much fuel.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fay, 26, who farms with his father, said, ''We try never to talk about it too much, but at some point in time we got to figure out whether it's feasible or not'' to stay in business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Kerr, Vermont's agriculture secretary, who has been lobbying Congress for more aid, said: ''We're very, very, very worried about this. Dairy farmers, they don't give up easily. But you can only take so many shots to the torso before you're done.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 5 -- When it comes to government contracting, few companies are as aggressive or successful as GTSI, a Virginia-based information technology company with about 850 workers and almost $900 million in revenue. Last year, it won contracts worth over $500 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, for small businesses like MySource, a computer hardware company in Springfield, Pa., GTSI's gain was its loss.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donna Bozzetto, the owner, bid on several Air Force computer contracts reserved exclusively for small companies, and was surprised to see GTSI as one of the companies also competing. ''I was confused because this was supposed to be a small-business set-aside contract,'' Ms. Bozzetto said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration and other federal agencies are mandated by law to provide at least 23 percent of federal contracts to small businesses. But for years, government studies show, large corporations like GTSI, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have been counted as small businesses either through legal loopholes, via acquisitions or simply by mistake. And despite some efforts by the federal government to correct the mistakes, problems persist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes for small businesses are huge as they try to compete for contracts in an expanding federal marketplace. Since 2000, the amount of federal contracting has grown 55 percent, to $377 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, at least $4.9 billion worth of contracts, coded as small business, went to 13 of the largest government contractors, according to a review by The New York Times of contracting data provided by Eagle Eye, a research firm based in Virginia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The S.B.A.'s handling of small business contracting is a mess,'' said Harry C. Alford, president and chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. ''They know about this problem and yet it continues to happen. The agency is either unwilling or unable to deal with it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee and a frequent critic of the agency, agrees. ''They've known about this for years and continued to put out these reports saying 'we've exceeded our goal of awarding contracts to small businesses,' '' Ms. Velazquez said in an interview. ''But every study points out that they are not truly achieving those goals. Small businesses don't want a handout, but they want a shot at competing on a level playing field.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration, however, gives itself high marks. In a news release last week, the agency said that it had awarded more than a quarter of contracts to small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is excellent news for small businesses doing business with the federal government,'' said the departing S.B.A. administrator, Hector V. Barreto, in the release. ''For the third year in a row, the federal government has met or exceeded its small-business contracting goal. The president and his administration are committed to helping small businesses get their fair share of government contracts.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GTSI was able to compete for the Air Force contract because of a provision in the law that allows companies to compete for small-business contracts even when they grow larger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, GTSI was awarded a 10-year General Services Administration contract for a company with 500 employees or fewer, which the government considers a small business, said Paul Liberty, a spokesman for GTSI. ''Since the company was classified as a small business at the time of the contract, it maintains that status until the contract ends,'' Mr. Liberty said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contract ends next year, and GTSI may no longer qualify as a small business, but until then the company can compete for contracts as a small business. ''We don't make the rules, we just follow them,'' Mr. Liberty said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bozzetto, the owner of MySource, said this loophole in federal contracting laws provided much larger competitors like GTSI an unfair advantage over her sole proprietorship.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have small companies like mine with a few employees trying to compete for contracts with a company with 500 employees and $1 billion in revenue, we don't stand a chance,'' Ms. Bozzetto said. ''It's ludicrous to call a company that big a small business.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for General Dynamics, which was listed as having 47 contracts, said those probably resulted from acquisitions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've acquired a number of companies in the Northern Virginia area, and if they had small-business contracts prior to that they would still be listed as small-business contracts,'' Mr. Doolittle said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at Northrop Grumman, which was listed as having 121 contracts, also said the company was most likely included because it acquired smaller concerns with existing contracts. The company said those business units would not be eligible for small-business contracts in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Boeing, listed as having 37 contracts, said the company was listed because it had acquired some small businesses with contracts or because its subsidiaries had received contracts as small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The government is looking at these companies as small business and not at Boeing as a whole,'' said Bob Jorgensen, a Boeing spokesman. ''They feel these companies shouldn't be penalized because they are associated with a large company.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its own study this month, Eagle Eye found that the percentage of federal contracts given to small businesses dropped in 2005 to 17 percent from 20 percent, but that included larger companies so the percentage could be much smaller. The instances of large companies' being awarded small-business contracts have grown to the point that the S.B.A.'s Office of Inspector General listed it as one of the most serious management challenges facing the agency this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under federal contracting laws, a small business is determined by revenue and number of employees, under standards set by the Small Business Administration. Any manufacturer with fewer than 500 workers is viewed as small. And in the service and retail industries, the threshold is typically $6.5 million in revenue. But because the agency has more than three dozen classifications for size, a company can be listed as small for some contracts and large for others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a business is given a contract while it is classified as a small business, it retains that classification for the life of the contract, regardless of how much it grows, as was the case with GTSI. These contracts are called ''multiple award schedules,'' which are big umbrella contracts that the federal government uses to buy goods and services and are supposed to help agencies make more efficient purchases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schedule contracts are maintained by the General Services Administration, which requires companies to reclassify their status every five years. This allows them to compete as small businesses during that time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government studies show that large companies sometimes improperly receive small-business contracts because of errors by federal agency contracting officers who fail to check if companies were indeed small or relied on inaccurate information to determine their size.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, a Government Accountability Office audit of a contracting program for the Department of Commerce found several examples of contracting officers who were unable to document the size of companies awarded small business contracts. The audit also found instances of companies continuing to be listed and awarded contracts as small businesses even after being acquired or merged with larger contractors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A.'s inspector general said the audits raised serious issues for the federal government and small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If agencies are permitted to count contracts as meeting their annual small-business goals even though the contracts are actually being performed by larger business, this creates a disincentive for those agencies to identify other small-business opportunities, and legitimate small business lose out,'' Eric M. Thorson, the inspector general, said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has also tried to correct database errors and has removed hundreds of companies that have been erroneously miscoded as small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not saying that the misreporting issue is not important, but you can't say that the information shows that small businesses are losing business to large businesses,'' said Gary M. Jackson, assistant administrator for size standards at the S.B.A. ''It's the policies that were in place. We think that the changes we've made will make the reporting of small-business contracts much more accurate.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, a letter was posted in the aisles of the Gristedes supermarket on 74th Street and Broadway. Written by John Catsimatidis, the chief executive of the Gristedes chain, the letter announced that after three years in business, the store would be closing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High rent -- $2 million a year -- and rising energy costs had made it, Mr. Catsimatidis wrote, ''unfeasible to continue to operate a supermarket at this location.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Gristedes, another supermarket, Food Emporium, had operated at the same location with similar results, leaving after only two years. ''We thought we were smarter,'' Mr. Catsimatidis said by phone. ''But the rent in this location was 20 percent of sales. The average rent in the rest of our stores is 6 or 7 percent of sales. I guess we got the three-year itch.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gristedes at 74th Street and Broadway, which was closing on Friday, was not a neighborhood institution in the style of Fairway Market or Zabar's. It was not even the only chain supermarket on the grocery-rich Upper West Side: a Food Emporium stands at 68th Street and Broadway, for example, and Gristedes still has a branch at 86th Street. It was your average New York supermarket, the kind that stocks six-packs of Coca-Cola, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, and cheap pots and pans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Catsimatidis said this Gristedes was typical in another, worrisome way: its vulnerability to specialty grocers, rising rents and the seeming takeover of the city's prime commercial leases by banks and drugstores.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Gristedes that stood for 40 years at the corner of 62nd Street and Second Avenue recently lost its lease to Chase Manhattan Bank. Other chains, too, have announced closings in Manhattan, like Western Beef, which is shuttering its branch on West 14th Street.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Rogers of the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, a trade association, said banks could afford to pay higher rent than supermarkets and were viewed by landlords as cleaner businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Catsimatidis, who contends that within the next decade half of the city's 60 or so supermarkets will be gone, said, ''The retail biz is so sensitive in New York.'' He suggested that the New York Economic Development Corporation offer incentives and tax rebates to supermarkets. Several phone calls to the agency seeking a comment on that suggestion were not immediately returned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, at the 74th Street Gristedes, a worker disassembled the cash registers while groceries were packed into crates. The store was nearly empty of shoppers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One shopper, Rosa Helfgot, said she stopped by to say goodbye to some of the workers. But she seemed as dejected about the lack of a going-out-of-business sale as she did about the closing; because Gristedes has 40 other branches in the city, the store's contents would simply be relocated. ''They're not reducing any prices at all,'' she said. STEVEN KURUTZ   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ENERVATED New Yorkers waiting on the eighth floor of the Red Door Spa on Fifth Avenue, where the snap of clacking heels echoes off latte-colored tiles, listen for the lilting welcome of Valentina Bobric, an aesthetician who is considered by some clients to be the queen of New York's eyebrows. Ms. Bobric, wearing a white lab coat, usually seizes a client's hands in warm greeting.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the dismay of her following, among them business titans, fashion editors and politicians, the 32-year-old Ms. Bobric recently took a leave from her position at the Red Door at 54th Street.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, she enrolled at the New York University Graduate School of Social Work to become a psychotherapist. Between salon shifts, she recently counseled schizophrenics and depressed patients in a yearlong internship. Ms. Bobric now plans to finish school, and she and her husband, an immigration lawyer, are expecting a baby this fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she parted with clients, more than one salongoer welled up. ''I thought, one of us has to hold it together,'' said Ms. Bobric, who has large brown eyes and a pixie haircut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In several months, she intends to return to the salon, but only for one day a week -- four days too few for the faithful.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside spare, softly lighted rooms, she has honed her skill at assuaging the overworked or overwrought through services like an eyebrow arch ($28) or an eyebrow design ($39). A salon friendship is special, Ms. Bobric said, one spared external drama and free of posturing. ''People are smart,'' she said. ''They don't expect you to massage their egos.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For an eyebrow-shaping, a client lies flat on a table so that Ms. Bobric, standing at one end, can assess a face from an upside-down angle, which she describes as less confrontational.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's amazing,'' said Shari Domow, a client who is a lawyer. She proofread some of Ms. Bobric's papers for school. Another client helped to pay for textbooks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bobric demurs when asked about her client roster. Salon policy forbids divulging those names, many of them boldface.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, she said, they come for the same thing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people need a little happiness poured into their lives,'' Ms. Bobric said, with a quick, ketchup-pouring motion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bobric grew up in Bacau, Romania. As a teenager, she ran errands for a local salon, like buying fresh strawberries for facial masks. Later, she studied law but realized that it wasn't her calling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Bobric arrived in New York, in 2000, she found the employment landscape daunting and fell back on the skin care traditions she learned as a girl. As an immigrant, ''you don't have as many choices,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teresa McKee, now a senior vice president at the Red Door Spas, hired her. ''Valentina loves what she does, and you feel it in her hands,'' Ms. McKee said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bobric doesn't reveal what she has heard in the hushed warren of salon rooms. ''You do become their confidante,'' she said firmly. She looked out the window and knit her own perfect brows. LAUREN PORCARO   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When small businesses run into financial troubles, banks can be especially unforgiving. David Ayer, chief executive of Ayer Sales, an industrial plastics distributor in Woburn, Mass., got a taste of just how unforgiving in 2003, when a harsh down cycle took its toll.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayer Sales, a $10 million-a-year business that sells directly to clients in a variety of industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and waste water treatment, has 35 percent of its business tied to the semiconductor industry.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Mr. Ayer said: ''We lost nearly half our business. We hit a high in 2001 and today, we're at just 45 percent of that sales level. We had 52 employees then. Today, we've got 28.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the company's fortunes declined, its lender -- Citizens Bank in Providence, R.I. -- sent a financial consultant to try to steer Ayer Sales through the crisis. But before the company was turned around, the bank called in its loan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was painful,'' Mr. Ayer said. ''But when you start losing money, the banks shy away.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial consultant pointed Mr. Ayer to several banks, but all said the same thing: ''Show us six straight months of profit and we'll talk.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than close the business that his father had started in 1961, Mr. Ayer turned to an alternative that most small-business owners prefer to avoid: an asset-based loan from a commercial lender.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asset-based lenders use a company's assets as collateral. The loans to distressed small companies can be $50,000 to $1.5 million, and because the lenders are willing to bet on a company's assets as collateral, they embrace the very risk that banks avoid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After providing the loan, the asset-based lender typically takes control of a company's accounts receivable (money owed by its customers) and all invoices are paid to the lender rather than the company. As the payments come in, the lender holds back part of the money in escrow -- 20 percent is a typical amount -- to pay down the loan. The lender gives the remainder to the company. If customers are late with payments, the company pays a fee to the lender.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asset-based lending is not a new option for small businesses. The Commercial Finance Association, a trade association of such lenders, has 256 members and has been around since 1944. But while these lenders have saved thousands of companies with few financing alternatives, salvation comes at a steep price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ayer, who received asset-based financing from Systran Financial, a division of Textron, is paying 1.25 percent over the prime rate for the loan and that, along with the various nonnegotiable fees, are costing the company about $200,000 a year. ''It is much more expensive than a standard bank relationship,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the costs are high, small-business owners strapped for financing are grateful for alternatives other than borrowing from relatives, using numerous credit cards with far higher interest charges, or simply shutting the business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most entrepreneurs and business owners, the demand for capital comes quickly and leaves little time for the lengthy process of a bank loan. Most small companies do not have the means to hire accountants who can create slick financial presentations and business plans. Start-ups, for example, often find themselves in dire need of capital with few options. Venture capital firms are an option but often demand large equity stakes that dilute the entrepreneur's ownership of the business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can put more money in yourself, but if your business is on the rocks, it is hard to raise money at a decent valuation,'' said Thomas C. Tremblay, president of Guardair, a small industrial tool manufacturer in Chicopee, Mass. ''If you go to the venture guys, you might have to give away the company and you don't want to do that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternative financing companies have grown in popularity and the industry's rise has attracted a raft of entrants. The Commercial Finance Association counts among its members not just asset-based lenders but also inventory-based lenders, large and small independent finance companies, corporate subsidiaries like GMAC and GE Credit, and even business credit units of domestic and foreign banks. Bruce H. Jones, the executive director of the association, estimates that its members have more than $400 billion in loans outstanding this year, up from around $250 billion five years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Belzowski, chief financial officer of VitalStream Holdings Inc., a streaming media technology company in Irvine, Calif., said: ''They are an important part of the financing chain. When you really need the money, you do what you can.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, VitalStream was a struggling start-up and found itself in need of cash. It turned to the Boston Financial and Equity Corporation, which provides asset-based lending and equipment financing. VitalStream arranged for several million dollars' worth of equipment lease lines with Boston Financial.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the time, we weren't in a position to go to a bank and say, 'Here's what we want,' '' Mr. Belzowski said. ''Boston Financial was expensive but we were a struggling company and we survived a difficult funding period because of them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Monosson, chief executive of Boston Financial, a commercial lender founded by her father in 1968, said: ''None of my clients are profitable when they come to me. I like seeing them succeed. VitalStream won't come back to us. They are bankable at this point.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternative financing allowed John Ovens to make a winning bid for Air Courier, a specialty courier service based in Atlanta, when the company went on the market in 2001. As the only bidder for the company, Mr. Ovens was pursuing equity financing, but the process became bogged down and allowed several other bidders to emerge. Faced with an anxious seller who was about to drop his bid, Mr. Ovens turned to the Presidential Financial Corporation, an asset-based lender in Atlanta. As he began to work with Presidential, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 brought Air Courier's business as well as the deal to a halt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Presidential didn't back out of the deal, even with 9/11,'' Mr. Ovens said. He was able to close the deal, though he acknowledges that the costs are high. Air Courier pays 2.5 percent above the prime rate for its loan, plus a management fee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It costs us about $150,000 a year more than going through traditional financing,'' Mr. Ovens said. ''In 2005, we paid Presidential $365,000 in interest and fees. But we own the company outright and we manage it how we want to. There are no equity partners telling us what to do.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ovens says that this independence is the reason Air Courier has more than doubled in size, to $38 million in revenue, since 2001.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could move in another direction now,'' Mr. Ovens says, referring to his financing relationship with Presidential. ''But I haven't seen a traditional bank that would give us the flexibility to run with the business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayer Sales is thriving again and Mr. Ayer expects to secure a new round of bank financing by the fourth quarter. He says his experience with Systran has been positive, even with the steep cost of the loan. ''It certainly instills a level of fiscal discipline,'' he explains. ''And it was a small price to pay to keep the business going.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can have this. If you are Candice Bergen's basset hound.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the van is Steven Ogden, and his assistant, Golly Gee, a Chihuahua that sports a strand of pink pearls and barks authoritatively (as authoritatively as a Chihuahua can) at dogs that refuse to get into the bath.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ogden, a former television producer, gave up the 9-to-5 two years ago and took over the mobile grooming business from the woman who had cared for his dog and trained him in her trade. He added hydrotherapy baths, aromatherapy and massage for those dogs whose owners love them and are willing to part with $90 to show it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His client list could be from the BlackBerry of a Hollywood executive, and he often pampers as many as 14 dogs a day, which he says is far more relaxing than working in the television business: ''I got tired of the human dramas.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mobile dog grooming units have mushroomed in the past 10 years, with dozens of such businesses in Los Angeles, one of the first cities to offer them as an alternative to traditional pet salons, where a smattering of dogs in recent years have been killed by overly hot hair dryers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ogden said he chose the spa theme to differentiate himself from grooming vans, many of them owned by franchises, that offer just cleaning and clipping.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dogs, as it turns out, are more lucrative than cop shows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ten years ago, this business wouldn't have worked because people didn't care about their dogs the way they do now,'' said Mr. Ogden, who used to rescue pigeons in his youth, as he prepared his van, which is fully appointed with a bath, mobile grooming table and plastic containers filled with cotton swabs, shampoos and bows. ''Dogs have become like children now. People want the best for them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advantages he offers over pet-store grooming, he says, are that animals get individual treatment, rather than sitting in a mass of cages under a giant blow-dryer, and there is no dragging the dog away from home. His van offers a gentle experience for a grooming-averse dog, he said, with extras, like nail polish (''for special occasions'') and hair dye, if an owner craves a dog with a pink tail for Easter.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some dogs, when they hear my truck, just come running,'' said Mr. Ogden, as Buck, a lumbering bull mastiff owned by the music producer whose assistant is romantically involved with the dog walker of the rock star, also a client, hopped in the van.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buck, whose snout alone dwarfs the entire body of Golly Gee, offered up his paw for a gentle clip, and stared expectantly at the tub.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Ogden rubbed him with soap and the Jacuzzi pump doled out its stuff, Buck licked at the air with pleasure, and sat slack jawed through his paw massage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Remember, this is a dog that head-butted his way through a plate glass window because he didn't like the gardener,'' Mr. Ogden said proudly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buck got a kiss on the head, a sniff test of sorts, (''Because that is exactly what is going to happen when they get in the house'') and then it was Moose's turn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rescued dog hampered by fear and distrust, Moose needed to be muzzled for his clipping. (Mr. Ogden said he had never been bitten, but he said he refused to groom dogs who snarl at him. He also does not do poodles with a show clip, which requires elaborate styling.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ogden's phone rang. A client going out of town would be leaving a picture with the housekeeper of how she would like her Labradoodle (part Labrador retriever, part poodle) to be trimmed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next stop: Ms. Bergen's home in a gated area of Beverly Hills, where the mailbox is in the shape of a dog. Dickles the basset hound was delivered for his weekly bathing, and later Phyllis, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel mix, whose eyes flickered with tension as Mr. Ogden carefully blew out each strand of her hair so as not to spook her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She really is the princess,'' he said of Phyllis, not Ms. Bergen, who, as it turned, out was very nice when she greeted Mr. Ogden and looked swell in a polo shirt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the dogs-are-like-their-owners category, Mr. Ogden said, people who do not bother to comb their own hair also neglect the grooming of their dogs. Likewise, clients who have problems with respecting personal space have dogs with the same.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People whose pets are farmed out to the help, he said, are left with lonely dogs that look forward to his visits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone feeling skeptical about Mr. Ogden's devotion to animals would be moved by the gentle attention he gave to the ears of Kodiac, an aging golden retriever whose many operations and arthritis have rendered him unable to hop into the van.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ogden bathed him in the front lawn of his owner's home in Beverly Park, whispering soft words of comfort.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have lost a few dogs to old age,'' Mr. Ogden said. ''It definitely hurts. You wash a dog every week for two years, there definitely is a bond.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time management is such a good idea -- especially for small-business owners. It can increase effectiveness, productivity and profitability, as well as reduce stress.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only it didn't take so much, well, time.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Zoller Fenster is like many entrepreneurs who struggle to strategize for their business while managing employees and customers. As president of Image Dynamics in Dallas, however, one of her bread and butter services is helping her clients conquer their own time management and effectiveness issues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What is very exciting and fun at the beginning, and is meant to help you, becomes a burden,'' she said. ''It becomes another thing on your plate, so you end up not doing it. It becomes one more thing you stress about that really should be helping you. The people in my office are much more organized than I am.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With relatively few resources and often no support staff, managers of the nation's 26 million small businesses can find themselves even more pressed for time than overworked and stressed-out colleagues in big corporations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Time management, even though it's important for anyone, is more important for small-business owners simply due to the fact that they have more and varied responsibilities than a person working in a department or corporation. The small-business owner is very often the accountant, sales and marketing team, C.E.O. and janitor,'' said Monica Ricci, owner of Catalyst Organizing Solutions in Alpharetta, Ga.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who are not too overworked to avail themselves of time management advice are turning to coaches, books, software and seminars to help them bring order.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diedre Wachbrit, a lawyer in Westlake Village, Calif., is her own time management coach. She said she reassesses her skills every 6 to 18 months because she seems to need additional ones as her business grows. She is trying to teach herself to hand off tasks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's work to delegate,'' said Ms. Wachbrit, who specializes in planning for people with special needs and has a staff of 10. But she said it was important to resist the temptation to take two minutes to do something and instead to ''take five minutes to think how someone else can do it, because that will save me hours if you think about how often I do that same task over and over again.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the tools, agenda and to-do list for managing time are the same for the self-employed as for everyone else, entrepreneurs may have more control because they are the boss, not working for him.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time management experts say small businesses constitute no more than 20 percent of their clientele, despite the fact that entrepreneurs seem to have the most to gain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coaches charge from $200 for half-day one-on-one sessions to $6,000 for a daylong group seminar. Half a day generally is enough time to visit a workplace and establish a plan of action for an individual, according to coaches. A big emphasis is on urging clients to keep control of their schedule and not let their employees, customers or e-mail hijack their day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter A. Turla, co-author of ''Time Management Made Easy (Dutton, 1983),'' teaches in-house seminars and said small-business owners must be disciplined and set priorities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Time is one of your scarcest commodities,'' he said. ''Train other people that you have a job and that they need to leave you alone when you are working. You need to train yourself to the very same thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After working with Ms. Ricci, Jonas Berwick, a private detective in Lawrenceville, Ga., decided he should spend his time directing and expanding his seven-person business, not ''the minutiae'' like paperwork and routine administrative tasks. He reduced his workweek to 40 hours, from 70, and said that his stress level had dropped as well. Mr. Berwick later hired Ms. Ricci to conduct a seminar for his staff on overcoming procrastination.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, my life was one of worry and anxiety and stress,'' he said. ''I was a firefighter. All I did was put out fires. I never prevented fires from occurring, as I do now. I did not get any business growth or development accomplished.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts tell clients to establish business hours -- whatever works for them and their family -- and to set boundaries. It is easier said than done considering that many small-business owners work 70-hour weeks, go to sleep worrying about the job and think they must have their fingers in all aspects of the business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is worth the effort, said Edward T. Reilly, president and chief executive of the American Management Association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If someone has come to the conclusion that time management is important but they don't have time for it, they simply have come to the wrong conclusion,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanya Zingleman, a director and independent consultant with Southern Living at Home, sells home accessories tailored to Southern Living readers. She works from home and hired a coach when she started her business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the best thing I ever did,'' said Ms. Zingleman, who lives in Cumming, Ga. ''I was really in need of basic time management skills that I had not learned in the corporate world. When I was home, I couldn't get everything accomplished that I could at the office.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald E. Wetmore, who conducts time management seminars and has written books on the subject, said people must work smarter, not necessarily harder or longer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Entrepreneurs don't have anybody to account to but themselves,'' he said. ''They don't have the structure of a 9-to-5 environment with tasks that are directed toward them. Time ultimately is the prime resource that companies succeed or fail by.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a message not lost on John Schegg, president and owner of the Schegg Group. He took one of Mr. Wetmore's three-day courses 18 years ago when he started his outplacement and executive coaching firm in Shelton, Conn. Each night he spends about 30 minutes laying out the next 11 to 12 hours he will work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am as productive as I could possibly be,'' said Mr. Schegg, who has three full-time employees. ''If I waste two minutes during the day, that's shocking.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business people must decide what to postpone, delegate or forget. Getting it done, Mr. Wetmore said, does not mean doing it yourself.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners, however, tend to be reluctant to pay someone to do tasks they can do themselves, even when their efforts would be better spent elsewhere, Ms. Ricci said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Morgenstern, author of ''Never Check E-Mail in the Morning and Other Unexpected Strategies for Making Your Work Life Work , Fireside, 2004)'' said entrepreneurs were less open to the notion that they could change how they work than people in larger corporations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are more resistant to changing their behavior,'' she said. ''It's hard for them to visualize that things can be different, because they live in a vacuum. Nobody is above them. They have no mentors. They are afraid that if they change what got them to where they are, they will fail and their business will collapse. There is no cushion and no safety net.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanzania and Ghana catapulted this year into the ranks of the top 10 reformers. Rwanda and Nigeria made it into the top 20.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 26 other African countries took modest steps to ease business regulations ''by the stroke of a minister's pen,'' the report noted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africa, the world's poorest region, currently has the highest tax rates and some of its most convoluted and antiquated business regulations. In every African country, most businesses operate underground, beyond the reach of regulators and tax collectors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Authors of the report, ''Doing Business,'' by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, the bank's private sector arm, say they hope simplifying and easing the rules of the capitalist game will entice more businesses above ground.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of 30 researchers found that African countries had made many incremental changes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most surprising thing for me was to see the pickup of reform in Africa,'' said Simeon Djankov, a World Bank economist who four years ago developed the rankings on the ease of doing business. ''Something has happened this year. At least two-thirds of Africa's countries have at least one positive reform.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanzania computerized its business and tax registries and reduced delays in customs inspections and the courts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ghana has cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, from 32.5 percent, and made it easier to export goods.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rwanda scrapped a law adopted during Belgian colonial rule that had given one official a monopoly on notarizing documents for the entire country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivory Coast slashed the time to register property to a month from more than a year by eliminating a requirement that the urban minister give his consent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy donors like the World Bank, the United States and Britain, which focus on spurring economic growth and job creation, are putting heavier emphasis on such changes in deciding where to provide aid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Millennium Challenge Account, President Bush's aid program, explicitly uses the bank report's measure of days to start a business as one criterion for deciding who qualifies for large grants.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists outside the bank say the wealth of statistical information and rankings are useful to countries seeking to improve their investment climates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they also caution that scoring well in the rankings is no guarantee of economic growth and no substitute for a broader economic strategy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just one piece of the puzzle,'' said William Easterly, a former bank economist who is now an economist at New York University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist, said the report focused on steps that got government out of the way -- like cutting taxes and regulations -- but he said that countries often needed governments that encouraged industries through subsidies, preferential tax policies or special economic zones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's assumed is that if government provides the right environment for property rights, contract enforcement and low taxes these economies will take off, but in actual fact, economic development requires a government more actively involved with the private sector,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Djankov, an author of the report, agreed that there were things a government could do that might be more important to economic development than the factors in the report. For example, he said, building a port might make be significant but it could also cost billions of dollars and take years to complete, unlike the changes in the report. ''These reforms are very cheap and easy to do for a government,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's ''Doing Business'' report ranked 175 countries by the number of days it takes to start a business and on other indicators that measure contract enforcement, investor protections, corporate taxation levels and the flexibility businesses have to hire and fire workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nations the bank named as the top 10 reformers were, from the best, Georgia, Romania, Mexico, China, Peru, France, Croatia, Guatemala, Ghana and Tanzania. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and wealthy Western nations were the leading regions, followed by Africa. This year, South Asia brought up the rear.   </p>

A 2005 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management said that almost half of human-resource specialists had significantly increased the time they spent checking resumes. The survey also found that 52 percent had started contracting a lot of the background checking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Medvec has run the Medvec Resources Group, a job placement firm in Valley City, Ohio, specializing in machine tool personnel, for the last 20 years. He used to be in the machine tool business himself, and said that now that even lathe operators have resumes, it is essential to have professionals like him check them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, when I started, machinists did not use recruiters, so they didn't have resumes,'' Mr. Medvec said. ''They filled out applications and waited to be called. Now with recruiting more prevalent in the skilled trades and all the job dot-coms, suddenly these guys need resumes. They don't know how to do them. Then they worry that they aren't good enough, so there is more and more lying going on. It is sad, but it is true.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One easy check, the experts say, is education. Universities and other instructional institutions are usually cooperative about sharing at least whether a person graduated or attended the school, and have quick access to databases. They also want to fight the growing tide of falsification.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rutgers University Career Services office, for instance, did an audit last year and found that 20 percent of students submitting resumes had inflated their grade-point averages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Richard White, the director of the Rutgers office, said that this was partly an outgrowth of the Internet age. He said employers should be especially wary of resumes that come in online, since it seems applicants are more willing to fib that way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just think people are more loose about information than in what we called the good old days,'' Dr. White said. ''It used to be that you had to submit a paper resume every time you applied for a job. I think that it must have been that that was a tangible act, something you had to repeat physically and mentally, so you felt yourself more accountable each time. Now it is pushing a button, sending a bunch of type on a computer screen off somewhere. It is like it just isn't real.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. White said small businesses should check educational information. Grade-point averages may not be so important, but degrees and majors may be. A former employer may be worried about being sued if he gives a bad recommendation or, sometimes, any information about a former employee. The college, giving out proper information, only enhances its standing, Dr. White said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little time or personnel to waste, small businesses might have to resort to effective, almost one-shot, strategies in checking resumes. One executive at a large machine shop, who did not want his name used to keep his methods safe, said he had resorted to the pop quiz.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before they walk into the shop, I give them a little questionnaire,'' he said. ''I ask things like what particular attachments have you used on this or that machine? I ask them technical terms. I ask them something little about a machine, something only someone who has worked on one will know. It saves a lot of time.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt FitzGibbons, the human-resource manager for Manth Brownell, a precision-turned parts company in Kirkville, N.Y., said he had been cautious lately looking at resumes, particularly at dates of employment. ''The economy here in upstate New York has been a bit rough in the last six years, so I see resumes, say, that are more vague in when they worked,'' he said. ''A '2004' could mean they really worked last in late 2003 and then started back in 2005, because some company closed, or whatever. It's hard to fool me, though, since I know which companies folded when. It's a shame, but some people feel they have to do that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resume fraud may be cyclical. Jude M. Werra, the president of Werra &amp; Associates, an executive search firm in Brookfield, Wis., puts out what he calls the Liars Index, a survey of how many executive resumes have falsified education claims. He divides the number of people who have misrepresented their education by the total number of people whose education his company has checked. For the first half of 2006, Mr. Werra said, he found 16.07 percent of resumes had education misrepresentations. The lowest number came in 2003, during a hiring binge and soon after the Notre Dame event.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses can't check everything, especially vague claims like 'helped the company eliminate waste,' but they can check education easily,'' Mr. Werra said. ''Either they got the degrees or they didn't. Either they attended the schools or they didn't.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't stop checking completely. ''The baby bust is coming, and small companies may stop being so vigilant as the demand for good people goes up,'' Mr. Werra said. ''They may think when they have someone who looks good and sounds good, well, 'Let's go before he goes to someone else.' In the end, it will pay to step back, check at least the things you can. There are too many resumes out there with lies not to.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMBING through this year's tax and pension laws, leading tax professionals have identified provisions and strategies that small businesses can use to their advantage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pension Protection Act of 2006 made permanent a number of enhancements to individual retirement accounts and defined-contribution retirement plans, including 401(k) and Simple plans, which are popular with small businesses. The enhancements, enacted in 2001, are scheduled to expire after 2010, leaving businesses reluctant to make changes that might be temporary. ''Since 2001, planning has been precarious at best,'' said Paul N. Gada, a lawyer and senior tax analyst at CCH, a publisher of books and software for tax professionals. ''Now that uncertainty has been removed, it should have a positive impact,'' encouraging businesses to set up and improve plans.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the permanent enhancements cited by CCH are:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher dollar limits for contributions. For I.R.A.'s they will be $4,000 this year, $5,000 in 2008 and inflation-adjusted in future years. For 401(k)'s they will be $15,000 this year, and for Simple plans, $10,000, with both adjusted for inflation thereafter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional contributions, known as catch-up contributions, for workers age 50 and older. They are $1,000 for I.R.A.'s with no future inflation adjustment; $2,500 for Simple plans; and $5,000 for 401(k)'s in 2006, with both inflation-adjusted in future years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides regular 401(k) plans, employers may sponsor Roth 401(k) plans, under which after-tax money goes into the plans and retirement distributions are tax free.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers with no more than 100 employees that offer new plans can take a tax credit up to $500 a year for each of the first three years for pension plan start-up costs. Mark Luscombe, a lawyer and accountant who is the principal tax analyst at CCH, said the new pension law also made important changes in the rules governing 401(k) plans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new ''opt out'' rule is the reverse of present practice. Employees participating in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans have always had to sign up and tell their employers what percentage of their salaries to withhold. Now employers sponsoring 401(k) plans are to sign up employees automatically. Employees who do not wish to participate must then opt out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another change allows providers of retirement plans to offer personalized investment advice to account holders. The Bush administration contended that workers needed help in choosing investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third change, for small employers, would simplify reporting requirements by allowing them to combine reports of defined benefit and 401(k)'s in one document.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes, Mr. Luscombe said, are intended to encourage more employers to offer plans and more employees to join them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going beyond its name, the pension law also extended the rules that authorize popular Section 529 college savings programs sponsored by states. Many states allow tax breaks for money that residents put into such plans, and distributions, when used for qualified college expenses, are tax free.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Fleming, a managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hartford, said the plans are not just for children. Many businesspeople want to take business-related courses, and most 529 plans allow adults to name themselves as beneficiary when setting up the plan. A few state plans, however, have age-related requirements, he said, so check the plan before investing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money may be used to pay for part-time or full-time course work, and even for learning by Internet at the college or graduate level, if the courses are offered by institutions that qualify for federal financial aid.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act, which President Bush signed on May 17, could give an indirect impetus to a favorite income-shifting strategy of business owners, namely employing their children, said Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and accountant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason is that the law raised the age limit on what is known as the kiddie tax to 18 from 14. Under the kiddie tax any unearned income, like dividends and interest of more than $1,700 in a dependent child's name, is taxed at the parents' tax rate. But any income a child earns is taxed at the child's rate. A self-employed person can hire her child and the child can invest her earnings for college.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work must be real work for a realistic wage, Mr. Kess said. Most high school students are computer literate and can do office work, he said, and most businesspeople want their children to learn their business, so the advantages go beyond taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kess gave this example: ''Let's say you're in the 28 percent bracket. You hire your child and pay $9,150. You deduct the wages on Schedule C, saving $2,562 in income tax and $1,400 in self-employment tax, for a total tax savings of $3,962. The child takes the standard deduction of $5,150, so taxable income is $4,000, and the tax on that is $403, meaning the family tax savings is $3,559. Or the child can contribute $4,000 to a deductible I.R.A. and pay no tax.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike incorporated businesses, people with unincorporated businesses do not have to withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes when they hire their minor children.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all the changes, one important issue for small business remains uncertain -- estate taxes. ''Something will be done before 2010,'' Mr. Gada said, but right now business owners do not know what it will be, and that makes planning difficult.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PUNCHING THE FINGER CLOCK -- It's a trick as old as the punch clock: you want to sneak out of work early and, promising to return the favor in the future, ask a co-worker to punch out for you at the end of the shift. No one is the wiser.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except, that is, for employers who realize they are losing many hours of productivity they are paying for.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now many of them are ripping out their punch clocks and installing time and attendance systems that require a fingerprint scan. Clarence Stewart, a podiatrist in Raleigh, N.C., installed a such a system three years ago for his practice, which employs 24 people in four offices, replacing another PC-based system that required an ID number.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stewart says his workers' time sheets now reflect the hours they have worked more accurately. ''I'm in a big practice, and some people work here for a long time and they become friends,'' he says. ''They know how to beat the system. But no one can fake a fingerprint.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The product he uses, from a company called Count Me In, in Mount Prospect, Ill., can feed information to QuickBooks and other payroll and accounting programs. Rules can also be set in the system's calendar so that an employee cannot clock in unless he is scheduled to work at that time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neal A. Katz, a vice president at Count Me In, acknowledges that some workers may be skittish about providing a fingerprint. But he says that his system does not store fingerprint images. Rather, it converts a fingerprint into a mathematical code based on the distance between the lines and curves on the print. ''Your fingerprint can't be given to someone else,'' he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The product starts at $300 for up to 50 employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVERTING DATA DISASTER -- Donna Childs remembers ordering the evacuation of her 14-member Wall Street firm on 9/11. Even when they returned a week later, there was no electricity or water, and ash had gotten into their computer hard disks, destroying some data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, Ms. Childs had learned about managing in disasters from her professional experience with risk assessment in the reinsurance industry, and from living in Battery Park City during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Well before 9/11, her technical people set up servers off-site with a mirror image of all the company's data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her business, Childs Capital, which raises money for entrepreneurs in developing countries, resumed with minimal disruption. Since then she has written a book, ''Contingency Planning and Disaster Recovery: A Small Business Guide,'' with her chief technology officer, Stefan Dietrich. She also gives talks on disaster planning to small-business groups, without pay. She does this, she says, because she sees so many small companies that are one tiny disaster away from disappearing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We realized we were very unusual,'' she said. ''Even large corporations don't think that way, but they have the excess resources to waste. Small businesses don't.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble with conventional disaster planning is its focus on catastrophes like hurricanes and dirty-bomb attacks, she said. ''Most people think, if you prepare for the worst case it subsumes all lesser examples'' like computer crashes, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Childs's advice is to plan for more routine causes of computer outages first, and build from there. That may mean starting only with the data that is vital to keeping the company running -- financial records and customer orders, say -- and using a cheap online service to automatically back up the data over the Web a few times a day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FREE CONFERENCE CALLS? Now you can make free conference calls, and you don't even have to put up with sh-sh-shaky voice quality.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its name, FreeConferenceCall.com doesn't send calls over the Internet; instead, it routes calls to portions of the phone network that don't get much use. The phone companies pay FreeConferenceCall.com a fee, and they recoup it through long-distance charges on portions of their networks that are idle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Erickson, the company's chief executive, said: ''The lunch is free, but there is a cost to get to the restaurant.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic service allows unlimited calls, each with a total of 96 callers and a six-hour call time. If you don't want certain callers, like clients, to incur toll charges, you can provide an 800 number for six cents a minute per caller. Calls can also be recorded, played back and streamed to listeners over the Internet, all free.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake is billions of federal contracting dollars, of which 23 percent, or roughly $85 billion, is legally set aside for small businesses. Government studies of federal contracting have revealed that a considerable chunk designated for small businesses ends up in the coffers of some of the nation's largest corporations.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the Small Business Administration revived debate over the issue when it announced that small businesses had received a record $79.6 billion in federal prime contracts for the 2005 fiscal year. The amount, said Hector V. Barreto, the former agency head, was $10 billion more than the year before, or 25.4 percent of the contracting dollars awarded in fiscal year 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's figures have been hotly disputed, and a recent study by the Democrats on the House Small Business Committee found that nearly $12 billion in fiscal 2005 contracts that were credited to small firms had been directed to large businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Congressional committees that oversee small business have been studying ways to strengthen the government's oversight and enforcement to ensure that contracts designated for small businesses actually land in the right place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship adopted proposals to strengthen the S.B.A.'s authority to, among other things, take action against companies that obtain contracts by misrepresenting themselves as small entities, and to require businesses to recertify their size yearly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House committee has bickered over what proposals it would include in its bill. The Democrats have proposed criminal penalties for contractors who knowingly certify themselves as small when they are not, and for allowing small businesses that have lost contracts because they were not properly coded as small business to seek damages for lost contracting dollars. The different approaches will be hammered out when the Senate and the House meet this fall to adopt the S.B.A.'s reauthorization bill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prodded by complaints from small-business owners and threats of Congressional action, the Bush administration set out some changes last month, noting that ''aggressive steps can and must be taken to increase small business access to the federal marketplace.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an Aug. 3 letter from the Office of Management and Budget to Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Senate small-business committee, the administration said it would seek ways to ''unbundle'' contracts -- meaning that huge contracts could be broken into smaller pieces for small businesses to bid on. It said it would add more oversight and try to change rules on the size of small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clay Johnson, a deputy director at the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote the letter, said the proposed rule changes were meant ''to guard against misrepresentation, miscoding or manipulation of the system by large businesses.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one central issue hurting small businesses in their pursuit of federal contracting dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government generally defines a small business as having fewer than 500 employees, but that can vary. The S.B.A. is reviewing the parameters, said Karen C. Hontz, the associate administrator for contracting, especially in industries that have gone through major changes, like information technology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyd Chapman, president of the American Small Business League of Petaluma, Calif., who has been a critic of how small-business set-aside contracts are awarded, said companies like Microsoft and Wal-Mart would continue to get unfair contract awards. He worried that proposed changes in size regulations would create a loophole that would ''do more to divert funds from small businesses'' than any fixes.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WOODY WARREN never thought that being in the National Guard would put him out of business. But that is what almost happened.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren was preparing for another season with his company, DSW Lawn Service, in Crestwood, Mo., when his National Guard unit was called to duty in Iraq in March 2003.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got called up right at the same time my season starts,'' he said. ''That kind of sank me right there.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren scrambled to keep his two-employee business alive. He found someone who had previously worked with him to take over daily operations, and enlisted his wife to do the bookkeeping. That would sustain the business for the next six months, which is how long Mr. Warren thought his deployment would last. Before the six months were up, his operations manager quit and his deployment was extended to a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I figured I'd be home by Christmas, or at least by the start of the 2004 season,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Warren's stay was extended a second time, until July 2004, forcing him to close for the year. He lost $50,000 to $60,000 in business the year he was gone, he said. His wife and two children scraped by on his military salary. He was able to restart his business when he returned, but only by taking a loan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren's predicament is similar to many small-business owners who have been called to duty in the National Guard or Reserves. Of the 100,000 active-duty guardsmen and women and reservists, about 18 percent are employed by small businesses, defined as having 100 or fewer employees, said Maj. Robert Palmer, a spokesman for the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, a Defense Department organization.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of that 18 percent, many of the soldiers are in businesses with just a few employees and many are business owners. ''And they're serving on active duty for longer periods of time than they used to,'' Major Palmer said. The Small Business Administration estimates that 6 percent of Guard members are self-employed or are small-business owners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are few safety nets for small-business owners who are deployed from the National Guard or Reserves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, proposed giving businesses with 50 or fewer employees a tax credit of up to $21,000 to cover salary shortfalls for mobilized reservists and costs for temporary replacements. But it stalled in committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, known as Userra, which guarantees the job security of reservists and guardsmen who are called to active duty, is meant to protect employees but does not really cover self-employment, Major Palmer said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Userra is one of the few employment laws that doesn't make a distinction between the size of employers,'' he said. ''It places a unique challenge on a small employer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Gotsis, a St. Louis dentist, said, ''Guys like me take a big hit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gotsis, who was in the National Guard, was deployed to Kosovo from November 2000 to January 2001 to do dental work on the soldiers. He was then called to Fort Knox in 2003 and to Camp Shelby, near Hattiesburg, Miss., in 2005. ''What hurt me was getting called up every 18 to 20 months or so,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Dr. Gotsis was told in advance that he would be serving, he had about five months to get his office in order. He kept one dental hygienist to clean teeth and one person at the front desk. But the breaks have been costly. He estimates that he lost about $250,000 for each of the three times he was deployed ''in terms of lost production and accounts receivable going down to nothing,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren and Dr. Gotsis sought financial help from the Veterans Business Resource Center, a nonprofit advocacy group in St. Louis. They were directed to a program called the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan, operated by the Small Business Administration, which offers loans up to $1.5 million and up to 4 percent interest. Mr. Warren said he used some of the money to buy a new computer for his business and to upgrade his landscaping equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was helpful to them, but we still didn't fix it,'' said Pat Heavey, director of the resource center, ''because both of these guys had to assume debt to get back into business.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the economic hardships, both Mr. Warren and Dr. Gotsis say they have no regrets about serving.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't trade it in for anything,'' Mr. Warren said. ''That's what we've been called to do. That's our mission.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I misspelled one address in the list, not one person received the newsletter,'' said Ms. Gordon, who owns Sojourn Bags. Once the list was corrected, 60 of the 200 copies sent were returned because of outdated addresses. She also had no idea who actually opened the newsletter or clicked on a U.R.L. link in the message.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was not a good introduction into e-mail marketing,'' Ms. Gordon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a Web search, Ms. Gordon found Constant Contact, an e-mail newsletter distribution company. Offering 100 templates and tracking reports indicating who and how many people read and clicked within an e-mail, the company helped Ms. Gordon prepare another newsletter in two days and send it to several thousand people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her cost for the service: $15 a month with no minimum commitment. ''Out of all my investments in marketing, this has given me the biggest return on my investment,'' Ms. Gordon said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its usefulness, Constant Contact has signed up just 70,000 customers in the seven years since it began, a fraction of the more than 24 million small businesses in the United States.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The product is an example of many small-business applications that fly under the radar, widely unknown to larger businesses. Limited budgets and other priorities mean that a large variety of products do not receive enough attention.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such products come from both small firms and multinational corporations. Few businesses are aware, for example, of Microsoft's Business Contact Manager, which is bundled with the company's Office Small Business Management Edition 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business Contact Manager is ''a lightweight customer relationship management system,'' said Cindy Bates, general manager of Microsoft's United States Small Business Unit. As a module within Outlook, the program helps businesses track the amount of time salespeople visit customers, apprise users of sales leads and turn orders into invoices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Microsoft product, Office Live, makes it easy to prepare a multipage Web site, automatically register and renew a domain name, receive e-mail messages using that name and host the site, all at no cost. (Office Live Essentials, with more features, costs $30 a month.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Google introduced Google Apps for Your Domain, a group of free Web-based services like e-mail and instant messaging as well as tools that allow small businesses to maintain their own Web sites with their own domain name without paying an Internet service provider or maintaining their own servers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as both Office Live and Google Apps are Web-based, the services' tools work with any operating system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Gryfakis, who owns Parking Padding Solutions, a two-person operation in Chicago that makes pads to protect cars from parking-lot posts, did not like his Web site, so he turned to Office Live's tools.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was free, so I had nothing to lose,'' Mr. Gryfakis said. He used the templates to make a new version in days. Mr. Gryfakis says the site has not increased his business but has improved his ranking on some search engines. ''My site hits have definitely increased,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramon Ray, the publisher of smallbiztechnology.com, said he thought that small businesses should consider creating their own blogs. ''Blogging gets you higher up in the Web rankings,'' Mr. Ray said. ''And blogging gives you a huge resource of information to put on your Web site.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To simplify the blogging process, consider free tools at blogger.com (which is owned by Google) or at wordpress.com. Another Web site, Typepad.com, charges $5 a month for a single user; it provides enhanced tools to help create the blog, add pictures and manage messages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Microsoft Office is the standard product for creating documents, slide shows and spreadsheets, some no-cost alternatives can create documents compatible with Word, Excel and PowerPoint.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Web-based software, available at sites like Thinkoffice.org and Zoho.com, users can grant access to others to read and change a file, without having to e-mail the document or keep track of the latest version. Files are kept at the company's servers rather than on the user's PC. And because the products are Web-based, they can be accessed using any operating system, but not necessarily any Web browser.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gordon, the handbag designer, said she was thrilled with the results she got from the Constant Contact newsletter mailing. Each time a newsletter is sent, she notices a rise in sales and Web site visits. ''For $15, you've got to be kidding me,'' she said.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARACK OBAMA is not a farmer, but he believes in biodiesel and the votes of farmers who produce soybeans and other crops for it. Senator Obama, Democrat from Illinois, spoke last month at an event to celebrate plans for a new biodiesel plant in Cairo, Ill. His presence was a welcome endorsement for a budding industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day that Mr. Obama joined the Renewable Energy Group in announcing that it would build a 60-million-gallon-a-year refinery, the company said it had garnered $100 million in financing, the largest equity investment in biofuels so far. The infusion came from the American division of Bunge Ltd., a major food processor; two venture-capital funds controlled by Natural Gas Partners of Irving, Tex.; and ED&amp;F Man Holdings Ltd., a global shipper of grains.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment underscores how the biodiesel industry is coming of age as demand for renewable fuels increases. The businesses range from soybean farmers in the Midwest seeking new markets to coastal start-ups with an environmental mission. Both camps are attracting a flow of money from venture capitalists and corporations alike.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, soybean farmers dominated the biodiesel business, but lately a broader array of entrepreneurs is joining the pack, creating a curious convergence of environmentalists, farmers and investment bankers. Growth in the last year has been ''phenomenal, almost frightening,'' said Joe Jobe, chief executive of the National Biodiesel Board, a trade association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ability of entrepreneurs to succeed in the long term will depend on much more than acres of oil-rich crops or deep pockets, industry players and analysts say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't necessarily have to be a national player, but you need to optimize distribution within your region,'' Mr. Jobe said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And you need to make high-quality commercial biofuel while promising consistent quality to your customers, he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people say anybody can make biodiesel if he can bake a cake,'' Mr. Jobe said. ''Have you ever baked a cake involving methanol, sodium hydroxide and other chemicals that could start fires?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 76 commercial biodiesel plants are in production today, up from 22 in 2004. The average business operates one plant that yields 30 million gallons a year of fuel and costs up to $20 million to build. Some companies are planning refineries capable of brewing up to 100 million gallons a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide production of the fuel tripled last year over 2004 to 75 million gallons. The board estimates that production will double this year, but Mr. Jobe estimates that the number could reach as much as, if not more, than 250 million gallons by year's end.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still a drop in the bucket compared with the nearly 140 billion gallons of gasoline the United States consumes each year. It also pales in comparison with ethanol. Last year, the global biofuels market totaled $15.7 billion in sales, of which only $1.6 billion came from biodiesel. That number could jump to $7.1 billion by 2015, says Clean Edge, a research company in Portland, Ore. But biodiesel has immediate appeal in that it does not require modifications of a diesel engine. It also requires far less fossil fuel to make than, say, corn-based ethanol.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biodiesel comes from soybean, palm or oil-seed plants like canola and mustard, as well as from animal fats. Corn oil can also be extracted for fuel. Some start-up companies and university scientists are testing algae, which is attractive because it would not dip into the nation's feedstock reserve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically blended with conventional diesel, biodiesel burns cleaner and releases fewer pollutants, including carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Several factors are driving growth, including a federal ruling on low-sulfur diesel, state mandates on renewable fuels and concern about climate change and dependence on foreign oil.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the strongest incentives are high petroleum prices and federal tax credits. ''If one of those two fall, the industry's growth would slow significantly, but would survive,'' said Eric Bowen, a lawyer who helped found San Francisco Biodiesel, which plans to build refineries based on rendered animal fat and recycled vegetable oil from restaurants. ''But if both fall away, the biodiesel industry would be in serious trouble.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal excise tax credit, aimed at curbing pollution, offers producers and distributors of agri-biodiesel, which comes from virgin crop oils and animal fats, $1 for every gallon of biodiesel they blend with regular diesel. This means that even producers who blend their 100-percent pure biodiesel with only 1 percent of petroleum-based fuel can reap the credit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most biodiesel sold in the United States is a blend of 20-percent pure biodiesel and 80-percent conventional diesel fuel, called B20.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, commercial demand has outpaced supply. Renewable Energy plans to produce 460 million gallons from several of its plants. The company was spun off from a soybean farmer cooperative called West Central, which built its first biodiesel plant in Ralston, Iowa, in 1996. Nile Ramsbottom, the president of Renewable Energy, said he expected sales to reach $740 million in 2010, a rise from $116 million last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without forming alliances and not managing risk between energy and agriculture commodities, many start-ups will falter, some industry experts contend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Plants are going up everywhere,'' said Gene Gebolys, founder of World Energy Alternatives in Chelsea, Mass. ''But individual plants must be part of a network in which products can get to the best markets.'' The company expects to exceed $100 million in sales this year from producing biodiesel from soybeans, canola and animal fat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first biodiesel business to receive venture-capital financing was Seattle Biodiesel, which recently changed its name to Imperium Renewables. Since spring of last year, three firms have invested $10 million in the company: Nth Power of San Francisco; Technology Partners in Palo Alto, Calif.; and Vulcan Capital, led by Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imperium's Seattle refinery produces five million gallons a year, and the company is building a refinery in Grays Harbor, Wash., able to produce 100 million gallons a year. Imperium now buys soybean oil from the Midwest, a costly business. But it is seeking crop sources closer to home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another biofuel company, Greenshift Corporation, based in New York, announced in June that it had received $22 million from Cornell Capital Partners for its GS AgriFuels division, mostly to build a plant that will produce 45 million gallons of fuel a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major food processors like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland Company are investing heavily in biofuels. On the energy front, Chevron and BP are pouring millions into biofuels production or processing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses will have to reckon with big players. As Mr. Gebolys of World Energy says of the biodiesel business: ''It's still fun, it's cool, it's dynamic and it's global. And you get to make a contribution.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yusuf Muhammad is a moneylord, a shipping magnate who threw his weight -- and men and money -- behind the Islamic militias and helped bring them to power in June.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cost of doing business had simply become unacceptable,'' Mr. Muhammad said of the days of anarchy before the Islamists took control. ''So we made a move.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move was initially celebrated by Mogadishu's people who, for the first time in 15 years of unrelenting clan warfare, enjoyed a modicum of peace. But three months into the new Islamic fiefdom, things are changing. While the millionaires of Mogadishu (and at 14,000 Somali shillings to the dollar, there are quite a few) continue to bankroll the Islamists, poorer people here are increasingly ambivalent. They describe a harsh and brazen government, whose troops bullwhip women for not wearing veils and summarily execute political enemies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The much appreciated stability may be cracking. On Sunday, an Italian nun was gunned down in front of a Mogadishu hospital where she had served for years. There was speculation that the nun, Leonella Rose Sgorbati, 65, might have been shot by Islamic gunmen in revenge for Pope Benedict XVI's recent remarks on Islam, but the motive for the attack remained unclear.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mogadishu is still an edgy place, where machine guns and bazookas are sold openly in the market, and the signs of war are everywhere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Razor-straight avenues mapped out by the Italians decades ago are corridors of ruin, with crumbling, bombed-out houses lining the streets and giant cactus plants exploding from the ground floor windows. White plaster storefronts are freckled by bullet holes. Junked pickup trucks lie half-buried in sand. It is as if every single inch of this city of two million people, the country's capital when there was a functioning government, was at some point violently contested.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That,'' said a truck driver, pointing to a pile of scorched white blocks sitting on top of a hill, ''is the old Parliament.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new parliament, as it were, is the Shura Council, 91 sheiks from the major clans who have sworn their allegiance to the Council of Islamic Somali Courts, the new name of the Islamic government. They meet in a red-brick building.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, this is a watershed for Somali politics. Somalia is a thoroughly clannish society, split by rivalries that go back to the days when the clans roamed the deserts and fought over pasture land. The Hawiye clan, Mogadishu's most powerful, dominates the Shura Council, but the Islamists seem to have done a better job than any previous government of uniting the major clans and subclans. Almost all Somalis are Sunni Muslims, and several business leaders said religion might prove to be the Somalis' elusive connective tissue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the one thing we all trust,'' said Muhammad Abdi Ali, chairman of the Mogadishu chapter of the Somali Business Union, as he tapped a copy of the Koran.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somalis are legendary businesspeople, and even during the darkest days of civil war, they managed to turn a profit. The central government officially collapsed in 1991, and Mogadishu soon became the ultimate example of deregulation. Gutsy entrepreneurs, including some women, opened their own hospitals, schools (typically $10 a month per student), telephone companies, power plants and ports. There was even privatized mail delivery. Those risk-takers became the new class of moneylords.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But doing business in anarchy has its drawbacks, like having to pay off a different pack of thugs every block or two. Ismail Goni, who owns an import-export business in Mogadishu, said that each time a shipment arrived, he had to hire dozens of his own gunmen to guard the cargo.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And we still lost 10 percent,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This January, the moneylords decided enough was enough. When a group of clan-based warlords attacked El Maan port, north of Mogadishu, business leaders teamed up with Islamic forces who had been present for years, though mostly in the background as social service organizations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The business community gave us their money and their lives,'' said the Islamic Courts information minister, Abdulrahim Ali Modei. That alliance led to the defeat in June of the warlords, who had lost much popular support because of their banditry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a thank you to the business leaders, one of the first actions the Islamists took was to reopen Mogadishu's port and airport. On Sunday, as planes skidded to a stop on a runway near the beach, hundreds of workers at the port unloaded sacks of flour from the belly of cargo ship.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is not all smooth sailing. One complication is the Transitional Federal Government, based in the inland town of Baidoa and internationally recognized. Despite two rounds of peace talks, the two sides have yet to figure out a way to share power.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem is the mixed feelings toward the Islamists in Mogadishu. Several people said that they appreciated the order the Islamists have brought but that they were worried about the future. On Sunday, Islamist gunmen, trying to close down a movie theater showing a soccer match, shot and killed a 13-year-old youth, Agence France-Presse reported, quoting witnesses. The Islamists recently shut down a radio station for playing music and unveiled a strict religious code that bans women from politics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Idil Farah, a mother who runs an orphanage, does not like the sound of that. ''But what can I do about it?'' she said. ''I don't have any power.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside Somalia and out, the Islamic Courts have been likened to the Taliban, who rose to power in Afghanistan by bringing order, then turned to repression and terrorism.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a comparison that the Islamic leaders do not necessarily mind.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Taliban are our brethren,'' Mr. Modei said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business leaders, though, have a different view.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People here are free, freer than they have been for years,'' said Mr. Muhammad, the shipping magnate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had faith that the Islamists would continue to deliver peace -- and prosperity.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the architect and urban redeveloper Guy L. Bazzani moved from Northern California to Grand Rapids, Mich., more than a decade ago, he didn't expect his ideas about socially responsible, environmentally healthy business to be embraced right away. Local companies had suffered enough economic hardship without the added burden of such ideologies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, after Mr. Bazzani set up shop as Bazzani Associates in 1994, he gradually persuaded the community of the economic soundness of his green business practices. The firm, which specializes in restoring old buildings, uses techniques and tools including green roofs that are covered with plants, storm water management systems and environmentally friendly building materials.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found that we can build green buildings that utilize 40 percent to 50 percent less energy at the same price as traditional buildings,'' Mr. Bazzani, a Michigan native, said. ''When I came back here I thought I'd stay a couple of years and return to California. But my green business took off. When people come to me, I'm their first choice, a locally owned business that can produce at value.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this Rust Belt city of 280,000 is any barometer, small, local businesses are inclined to embrace social responsibility and will promote environmental health. In three years since Mr. Bazzani, 51, founded an organization called Local First, more than 250 independent businesses in Grand Rapids have come on board.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lots of people have lived here all their lives,'' Mr. Bazzani said. ''When you have a generational community like this, there is a lot of natural social responsibility. You don't have to call it that. But people just love the community and they'd rather buy a product from someone they know.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turns out, Grand Rapids is not alone. Local First is just one of 35 similar business networks around the United States and Canada that have sprung out of the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, or Balle, a nonprofit organization founded in 2001 by two successful small-business owners in Boston and Philadelphia. The networks, in major metropolitan areas and smaller cities, represent more than 11,000 local, independent businesses. The group promotes the notion of the ''triple bottom line,'' the concept that local businesses can simultaneously be profitable and foster social and environmental consciousness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laury Hammel, the owner of a group of health clubs in the Boston area, and a Balle co-founder, says the organization includes serious business people of all political persuasions who are seeking to fend off the effects of the big discount chains and globalization.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to be a force to make businesses become positive role models,'' Mr. Hammel said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, Mr. Hammel says, is the face-to-face connection that customers experience by shopping locally. In an increasingly technological world, people yearn for this connection because they feel they are losing the cultural, spiritual and human element of their lives. ''Studies show that when you go to a farmers' market, you have 100 times the number of conversations you have in a grocery store,'' Mr. Hammel said. ''We think local is one of the most important words in the English language.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Judy Wicks, Balle's other co-founder, opened the White Dog Cafe, a popular Philadelphia restaurant, 24 years ago, she realized that she had to spend so much time making her restaurant work that the only way to be socially active was through her business. The White Dog became known for buying its electricity from wind power and for purchasing its produce from local organic farmers and its meat, poultry and fish from producers that practiced humane treatment of animals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Profit is a tool,'' she said. ''The major purpose of business is to serve.'' She decided early on to open up the restaurant as an educational forum with guest speakers and to share ideas with her competitors. ''We do well by doing good because we're known to do the right thing and people appreciate that,'' she says. ''Our customers and employees share our values and come here for a sense of community, for a chance to be aligned with something greater than themselves.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though such practices tend to be more expensive, the movement is rapidly gaining believers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm surprised how much this has grown in the past year or so,'' said James Post, professor of management at Boston University. ''The question is whether you can serve an economic master and have these other values at the same time. The answer is yes; the triple-bottom-line notion is taking root.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bellingham, Wash., a city of 80,000 near the Canadian border, Sustainable Connections, the local Balle network, has grown to more than 500 members in just four years from 12 original local business owners. ''There's a 'buy local' culture here,'' said Michelle Long, the organization's executive director.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One significant byproduct of the effort is that Bellingham retains its commercial uniqueness as a community of small businesses instead of chain stores, Ms. Long said. ''If you retain these one-of-a-kind businesses, it's not like Anyplace, U.S.A.,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some urban entrepreneurs like Glynn Lloyd, chief executive of City Fresh Foods in the Dorchester section of Boston, have found the triple-bottom-line quest tougher going. In inner-city neighborhoods, he says, it is difficult for local businesses to get traction. Shoppers, long ignored by developers and big national chains, are pleased to see Home Depot and Starbucks come to the area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Balle contends that growing evidence supports the theory that buying local is better for the community. One study in Austin, Tex., by Civic Economics, a strategic planning consulting firm, compared the impact of a Borders bookstore and two local independent bookstores. They found that for $100 spent at Borders, just $13 stayed in the local economy, while $100 spent in a local bookstore put $45 back into the local economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balle is intent on reshaping public policy, which it feels is biased against local small businesses. Michael H. Shuman, a Balle consultant and author of ''The Small-Mart Revolution: How Local Businesses Are Beating the Global Competition,'' says that economic development efforts that stress ''attraction and retention" are all about offering tax incentives to big companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, he says, mounting evidence suggests that these incentives have questionable payback for a local economy, often failing to produce either jobs or sustained economic health. ''Attraction and retention is not focused on locally owned business or existing local entrepreneurs,'' Mr. Shuman said. ''It almost assumes that indigenous people do not have the capacity to create these businesses, so we must go outside of the community to bring them in. This kind of bias needs to be eliminated.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to promote change is to illuminate the sustainability issue for a new generation of consumers, something Don Shaffer, 37, is doing in Oakland, Calif. His company, Comet Skateboards, uses only ecologically safe materials like water-based coatings and sustainable woods like bamboo. And his target audience -- teenage boys -- is responding. Sales on a percentage basis have quadrupled in three years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest driver is our commitment to sustainability,'' Mr. Shaffer said. ''Skaters get a bad rap for being extremely anti-authority but they are critical thinkers and they have a growing awareness of climate change, peak oil and what it means for them. They are voting with their dollars.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rev. Jesse Jackson acknowledges that minorities have made lots of progress in the last few decades. But he is still frustrated by the slow pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Jackson is stepping back into the arena. In January, his Rainbow/PUSH Wall Street Project, which he founded 10 years ago to prod American corporations into investing in minority businesses, will introduce the Small Business Institute. The institute will have a two-part goal: to teach entrepreneurship skills to teenagers, immigrants and minorities, and to prompt financial institutions to provide them with easier access to capital.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ghettos and barrios are underserved markets with untapped spending power,'' he said, ''so we're going to take Wall Street to Main Street. We give microloans in third world countries; why not in East Harlem?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need for assistance, he argued, is every bit as great as it was before civil rights legislation ended formal discrimination. Most studies of small business show that minorities are starting businesses at twice the rate of whites, he noted, and that ghetto businesses commonly employ people from the neighborhood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he asserted, white restaurateurs like Danny Meyer -- who started the Union Square Cafe and a succession of other Manhattan restaurants -- have little trouble opening restaurants in New York, yet the Woods family, which runs the popular Sylvia's Restaurant in Harlem, still has only one restaurant in New York. Percy E. Sutton, a black former Manhattan borough president, had to go to more than 50 banks before he could get a loan to buy a black radio station, Mr. Jackson said  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Huge pension funds don't hire too many minority-owned money management firms; the legal fees for mergers like Citibank and Chase do not go to black or brown firms,'' he added. ''And the current administration isn't even enforcing E.E.O.C. and contract compliance,'' he said, referring to the laws that govern hiring practices and that require a percentage of federal contracts to be set aside for minority-owned businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jackson said that once enough minority businesses operated in ghettos, they would be better able to help each other thrive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Byron Lewis, a black man who runs an advertising agency called the UniWorld Group, agreed. Mr. Lewis said he still smarted from seeing his first employer, a black weekly newspaper in Harlem, go under. White companies did not want to advertise to the ghetto, he said, and there were not enough black businesses to pick up the slack.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If more people of color start businesses, then whole neighborhoods will be resuscitated,'' Mr. Lewis said. He expected the Small Business Institute to enlist corporations and banks to provide not just money but also training for would-be minority entrepreneurs in management and technology skills. ''Reverend Jackson's relationships with the corporate world will help bring best-practices training to those that need it,'' Mr. Lewis said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense, the Small Business Institute is entering a well-populated niche. For example, more than 7,000 people have signed up to attend the National Minority Supplier Development Council's conference in San Diego next week, and 825 minority businesses have taken booths at its related trade show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Harriet R. Michel, the council's president, welcomed Mr. Jackson's initiative.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The future of our communities does rest on continued economic development,'' Ms. Michel said. ''Jesse's ability to focus energy will help him generate interest among minorities to start businesses, and among companies to buy from them.''  </p>

Both are full-featured programs that should save business owners time and prove valuable in developing their companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microsoft Office Accounting Express 2007 is financial management software intended for small and home-based businesses. It consists of desktop software that can be downloaded as well as seven integrated online services for selling products online, sending invoices and receiving payments electronically, processing payroll, running credit reports, collaborating with an accountant and more.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other program, Microsoft Office Live, allows businesses to establish their own Internet presence -- to set up Web sites, have their own domain names, set up corporate e-mail accounts and much more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rajat Taneja, the company's general manager of small-business applications and services, said the goal was to allow small businesses to ''use the economics of the Internet'' for financial tasks that may be taking time from their core business activities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These businesses for the most part haven't benefited from technological advancements because of the difficulty in adopting it,'' Mr. Taneja said. Now even the smallest businesses can get a technological edge free at ideawins.com, a Microsoft site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch? None. Still, Microsoft expects to make money in two ways. As companies grow, they will most likely pay for and upgrade to premium versions. Second, Office Accounting Express integrates with services offered by other companies, including ADP Payroll, Chase Paymentech, PayPal, eBay and Equifax, most of which charge fees to users, and Microsoft has fee-sharing agreements with them. ADP Payroll, for example, is offering its online service through Microsoft for a $169 annual fee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program provides full double-entry bookkeeping with a built-in audit trail, Mr. Taneja said, along with security access that allows the business owner control over what employees can see and flexibility to customize reports. The premium version, Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2007, will be available in stores early next year for an estimated retail price of $149. The successor to Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting 2006, it is intended for businesses with up to 25 employees and more complex needs, including inventory management, multicurrency invoicing, multiuser access and fixed-asset management.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baris Cetinok, Microsoft's director of product management for Office Live, said that after nine months the program was coming out of ''beta,'' or testing, today. It is available at officelive.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 50 percent of small businesses have Web sites, Mr. Cetinok said, which leaves the other 50 percent at a disadvantage when many customers use online search engines to find the goods and services they want.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A small business can now attract customers,'' he said, ''and do marketing on the Web.'' They can create password-protected sites with Web design tools and templates. Office Live also offers storage space on the Web; additional company-branded e-mail accounts and calendars; and the ability to chat online via text, voice or mobile phone with employees, customers and colleagues with Windows Live Messenger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office Live Basics is free, but the more powerful Office Live Essentials costs $19.95 a month. Office Live Premium is $39.95 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Virtual Assistant  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are perfectly organized and keep close track of all business expenses, mileage, lunches, entertainment expenses and so forth, read no further. But, if like many people, you find it hard to make time for recordkeeping, even for tax-deductible expenses, the Electronic Virtual Assistant, or E.V.A., may be for you.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By telephoning or using a hand-held recording device, users can send e-mails, schedule appointments, track expenses and fill in reports. The calls are transcribed and returned to users by e-mail, and organized on the Web site of E.V.A. from Virtual Management Inc., in St. George, Utah.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all about eliminating paperwork that is piling up,'' said Eric Tippetts, vice president of sales for E.V.A. ''I'll go into an office with 100 employees and ask, 'How did you spend your money last month?' Ninety-nine of 100 can't answer. What we try to do is get documentation. There are $11 billion of unused tax advantages that people are just giving up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system has several modules. The tracking module costs $49.95 a month for an individual. Mr. Tippetts said: ''Spend 30 seconds a day.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration announced new rules yesterday intended to help small businesses obtain more federal contracts and to assure that contracts set aside for small businesses are not going to larger companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules will require small businesses to recertify their size when they are purchased by or merged with a larger business, or at the end of the five-year point of a contract.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, size has been determined at the beginning of a contract and was retained over the life of that contract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A company that was small at the time it received a contract would continue to be listed that way throughout the life of the award, which is some cases could be up to 20 years. (A small business is determined by revenue and number of employees. For manufacturers, the threshold is fewer than 500 workers. For the service and retail industries, it is typically $6.5 million in revenue.) This allows concerns that had grown large to compete for small- business set-asides despite their size. The new regulation does not require the government to terminate an existing contract if a company's size changes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This regulation will go a long way toward ensuring that contract awards get in the hands of small-business owners, federal agencies get the proper credit toward their small-business contracting goals and small-business contract awards are fairly and accurately reported,'' Steven C. Preston, the S.B.A. administrator, said in a statement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has long been criticized for allowing larger companies to win contracts that are set aside for small businesses. By law, 23 percent of federal contracts are supposed to go to small firms, but several studies have shown that billions of dollars in small-business contracts instead went to corporate giants. A Congressional study in June found that companies like Microsoft, Google and Exxon Mobil were among the recipients of small-business contracts. The report said the contracts were a result of inaccuracies in the government database that tracks contracts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. said the new rules were not in response to criticism.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is something that has been proposed since 2003,'' said Karen Hontz, counselor to the S.B.A. administrator. ''The rules took time to develop.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the size recertification, the agency also announced the development of a Small Business Procurement Scorecard for 24 federal agencies that will track and monitor the status of each agency's small-business goal achievement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A said it would also hire employees to help identify government contracting opportunities for small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of New York, the expected next chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, said the rules did not go far enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The agency's rule fails to address the vast majority of this problem,'' she said in a statement. ''Eighty percent of the contracts miscoded were due to other factors than small businesses simply growing too large, which is all this regulation focuses on.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHANTRAINE, France -- Claude Villiere, wicker basket in hand, set out into the dense woods beyond this sleepy village to hunt his prey: cepes, better known in the United States by their Italian name, porcini mushrooms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is one in an army of part-time foragers who fan out through the country's forests until the frosts of November, filling markets across France with humid mounds of chunky white pieds de mouton, or sheep's feet; golden girolles; black trumpets of death; and cepes, the beefy brown toadstools that are the royalty of wild mushrooms.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a remarkable feat, given the quantities of autumnal fricassees, mushroom-spiked omelets and fungus-flavored sauces that the French consume, using hundreds of tons of wild mushrooms a year. Every bite leads back to a walk in the forest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The epicurean adventure is not without its dangers. Last month, the French health authorities warned mushroom enthusiasts yet again that they should be absolutely sure of what they eat after a dozen people were hospitalized -- three in intensive care -- with mushroom poisoning over the course of just two weeks in western France.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every now and then, someone succumbs. Two elderly brothers died near Bordeaux two years ago after eating deadly ''death caps,'' or Amanita phalloide, which account for most mushroom fatalities. They apparently mistook the pale gray fungus for ''agaric des bois,'' known in the United States as wood mushrooms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is even a lingering danger that some mushrooms could be tainted with cesium-137, which settled like snow over parts of Europe after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Mushrooms absorb and concentrate heavy metals or radioactive isotopes found in contaminated soil.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Villiere, 53, dismisses those concerns and insists that it is hard to mistake the most delectable fungi from toxic varieties. But following him through the woods proves otherwise. A novice accompanying him on a recent trip repeatedly picked what looked like cepes only to be told they were ''Satan's boletes,'' which ''would give you a good purge'' if eaten, Mr. Villiere said. He sliced open each specimen, and the white flesh quickly turned a telltale inky blue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doubting foragers can take their fungi to any French drugstore for an expert opinion because all pharmacists here are trained mycologists. In rural areas, they regularly sort through baskets of mushrooms, picking out the toxic ones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Agaric jaunissant gives us the most trouble,'' said Catherin Leconte, the pharmacist in Chantraine, pointing to a picture of Agaricus xanthoderma, the poisonous mushroom's Latin name. She said that people confuse the fungus, known in America as a ''yellow stainer'' because its white flesh turns yellow when bruised, with the tasty Agaricus campestris, known in the United States as the field mushroom or the meadow mushroom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Villiere says he learned everything he needed to know from his mother, which is how most French foragers learn. ''I have never had a problem,'' he said. ''But I only eat what I pick myself.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some foragers go out before dawn with miner's lamps on their foreheads because mushrooms -- especially cepes -- shine in the light. But Mr. Villiere prefers the daytime, and spends a few early hours each morning alone, hunting for champignons sylvestre.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He keeps enough to eat and sells the rest to a local depot, where they are sorted by size and sent by truck through the night to Rungis, the sprawling, fresh-produce clearinghouse outside of Paris.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local laws limit mushroom hunters from gathering more than a few quarts a day, and fungus wardens patrol some of France's most popular foraging spots. One person in southern France's Cevennes National Park was recently fined for having picked 150 quarts of mushrooms in a day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mushroom hunting is, by nature, a clandestine affair and the rules are regularly broken.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all have secret places,'' Mr. Villiere said. ''If you see someone, you don't go directly to your best spot. You walk around until they're gone.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is usually one big growth in June and another in September, and everyone knows that cepes will ''push'' a week or so after a soaking rain. At those times, the woods quickly fill with foragers creeping quietly among the trees like deer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are hundreds of wild mushroom varieties, but only a dozen or so that are commonly eaten and just a handful that are collected for commercial sale. Mr. Villiere paused to pluck a reddish-brown fungus from the shadows of the forest floor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ah, a gourmelle rose, this is the most beautiful one,'' Mr. Villiere said, peeling back the cap's skin to reveal a whitish meat beneath. ''It's very fine, better than cepes. This melts in your mouth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His favorite fungus, he said, is the ''gris de sapin,'' which comes only with the first frost, when the other mushrooms die.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his basket nearly full, Mr. Villiere returned to his car and drove to the home of Daniel Vujeic, 50, who runs a network of depots that buy mushrooms from foragers across the Vosges region. The foragers are responsible for cleaning the mushrooms. Mr. Vujeic's 18 depots deliver the goods to him in the early evening and he and a handful of workers sort them by size and ship them to Paris the same night. His trucks arrive in Rungis at around 4 a.m. Within hours, the mushrooms are sold to buyers for markets and restaurants across northern France. By nightfall, many will be gracing a plate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vujeic, the son of a woodcutter who grew up picking girolles while his father was working, says he moves about 150 tons a month during the June to November season, though the quantity doubles when the mushrooms are pushing. Prices fluctuate wildly, but cepes in some areas at certain times retail for more than $25 a pound.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, pollution and an increasing number of mushroom hunters have taken their toll on France's mushrooms. Most girolles, the first mushrooms to be commercialized half a century ago, now come from Russia, Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are beautiful, and they are cheaper,'' sighed Mr. Vujeic.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ythan Lax was not a newcomer in the business world. He had spent years in corporate communications before striking out on his own by opening a Little Gym franchise in upstate New York. But despite his experience, he felt unprepared to cope with the myriad legal issues that arose and sought out a lawyer for help.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you think that having an attorney that is qualified is expensive, try not having one,'' Mr. Lax said, who paid $7,000 for his. ''I can't count the number of mistakes I would have made -- taxes, financing and, perhaps the scariest part -- signing a seven-year lease with a personal guarantee,'' without the advice of counsel.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When do you really need a lawyer? Despite the proliferation of both self-help books and Internet advice, when starting a business even the most sophisticated of businesspeople find, as Mr. Lax did, that they need an individual lawyer to guide them through the most basic of decisions as well as the more complicated ones, like financing and property issues.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers often seem expensive and an intangible cost to entrepreneurs. The good news, says Thomas J. Walsh Jr., a partner at Brody, Wilkinson and Ober in Southport, Conn., is that ''most lawyers will typically have a consultative meeting when they won't charge because it's a time for both lawyer and client to see if they are a good fit for each other. Because there will be a lot of time spent with each other, hopefully over many years, it's important that the parties have chemistry and see that they see things in a similar fashion.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once you've retained a lawyer, it makes sense, experts say, to outline concerns and questions before the first official meeting. A little homework can go a long way in helping to keep costs down. Because lawyers charge by the hour, ''use your lawyers' time efficiently,'' said Mr. Walsh, who heads an American Bar Association subcommittee on closely held businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the first meeting when the fee clock begins ticking, Steven Gersz, a lawyer in Rochester, says he encourages companies both large and small to complete a formal business plan. ''It's your road map,'' he said. ''It forces you to think about how you will handle things before you get into business. It forces you to look at the product or service you're offering, how will you price it or target to your customer and how will you handle your competition.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not the ''length or prettiness of the plan that matters,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need to do it to make sure you've thought through all the big-bullet issues: marketing, competition and cash-flow needs,'' said Mr. Gersz, a partner at Underberg &amp; Kessler who has advised Mr. Lax.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After creating the plan -- which will not only aid lawyers but banks or other investors as well, the founders should consider the structure of the business -- corporation or partnership. The structure chosen may depend on whether the entrepreneur expects to have outside investors in addition to friends and family members, and whether the client needs to limit liability while having the tax benefits of the gains and losses from the business, Mr. Gersz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, an entrepreneur should also consider whether there are key contracts needed to conduct business. Those, Mr. Walsh says, can range from an agreement with a co-owner, a sales representative or an outsider, like a vendor or important client.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business owner also should think about any intellectual property assets that will be used by the new company. At a minimum, product or company names should be researched online first, even though a lawyer should ultimately perform a trademark search. The owner must also think about how to protect other assets -- designs or processes, for example -- when starting up. While it may be simpler to contribute the assets to the business, Mr. Walsh said that licensing them to the business could be a better option, because ''you can maintain some control over use of the invention.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other related issues that most entrepreneurs overlook are exit strategies and succession. Lawrence A. Goldman, a partner at Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione in Newark who runs the A.B.A.'s committee on small business, ''Preparing for an exit, in event of disability or death or dispute between the parties is a big issue. For the same reason that people put off doing their wills because they don't want to deal with issue of custody of the children, those going into business often don't deal with exit or disputes mechanisms because they don't want to have confront difficult decisions that may need to be made.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he says, it's important to have a mechanism for ''valuing the business, for determining how the value would be paid.'' Mulling over the options before meeting with a lawyer can save time, which typically translates into costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Lax, the devil was in clauses: ''The issue that could have been a deal-breaker on my lease and with my loan had to do with 'subordination,' '' he wrote in an e-mail exchange.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the event of bankruptcy,'' he continued, ''pretty much everyone wanted to have the first right to use my equipment and other assets as collateral. The franchisor, bank and landlord all felt that they should have the first claim to assets, and obviously, you can't use the same assets to secure every business relationship.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can guarantee you that I did not fully understand the wording of these clauses and without a qualified attorney to negotiate and modify the terms put forth by each entity, I would have certainly signed each agreement and would have pledged the same collateral to three different companies. This could potentially have voided my franchise agreement, loan terms and lease.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how efficient, legal services will, inevitably, seem expensive to those starting out in business. It is, Mr. Lax said, ''extremely difficult when buying tangible items to get a business started to put a huge amount into services you can't touch, taste or smell. Counsel is expensive and no one says 'I can't wait to pay my attorney's bills.' But it's a mistake to put your life into a business without counsel.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you have any suggestions for individuals and small businesses to combat spam?  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Small businesses can have just as much unsolicited junk mail clogging their mail servers as do larger corporations, but often lack the human and software resources of the bigger companies to fight it as effectively. But there are some options for fighting back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Internet service providers or companies like Yahoo that host small-business Web sites and mail servers offer spam filtering at the server level, so you may want to check with your I.S.P. to see what's available. Providers like America Online and EarthLink already filter spam for individual e-mail accounts. If you are still getting a lot of junk in your mailbox, you might try adjusting the filter settings; check your service's Help guide for instructions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your company has its own mail server, there are plenty of server-based programs to filter a message before it reaches an employee's desktop. Several security companies offer versions of their programs for small businesses (usually those with around 5 to 100 employees) that are less expensive than the enterprise programs for large companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Symantec's Mail Security ( www.symantec.com [http://www.symantec.com]) and McAfee SpamKiller for Mail Servers ( www.mcafee.com [http://www.mcafee.com]) are two options designed for smaller businesses to help stop spam and viruses from infiltrating company e-mail. TrendMicro ( www.trendmicro.com [http://www.trendmicro.com]) and Panda Software ( www.pandasoftware.com [http://www.pandasoftware.com]) have their own spam-filtering and server security products as well. Some companies base their prices on the number of users involved, so it may cost $600 to $700 to buy the software for 20 employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cloudmark ( www.cloudmark.com [http://www.cloudmark.com]) and ChoiceMail ( www.digiportal.com/enterprise.html [http://www.digiportal.com/enterprise.html]) are two other spam solutions with small-business options. If you use Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft has a page of tips and tools for configuring the server at  www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx [http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx].  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spam can also be weeded out of the in-box by many stand-alone filtering programs or by the mail program itself. Outlook, Thunderbird, Eudora and Apple's Mail are e-mail programs that offer a junk filter, and the Windows Mail application in Microsoft's new operating system, Windows Vista, has a junk filter as well.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I have a mixed network of Macs and PCs that all connect to an AirPort Express wireless base station, but only the Macs can wirelessly print to the connected U.S.B. printer. Does this feature not work with Windows XP?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Apple recommends first installing Bonjour (software that simplifies using devices on a network) for Windows. You can download Bonjour for Windows at  www.apple.com/support/downloads/ [http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/].  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you install Bonjour, go to the Windows Start menu and select ''Printer and Faxes.'' On the next screen, click on ''Add a Printer.'' When the ''Add Printer Wizard'' comes up, click on ''Local printer attached to this computer'' and uncheck the option for ''Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer.'' Click the Next button.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the next screen in the ''Select the Printer Port'' area, click on ''Create a new port'' and choose ''Standard TCP/IP Port'' from the pop-up menu. A new Wizard program appears, asking you to enter the printer name or its Internet Protocol (IP) address. Type in ''10.0.1.1'' (if you are using the default AirPort settings, and without the quotation marks), and the port name will come up at ''IP-10.0.1.1.''

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs have plenty of things to keep them awake at night worrying: payroll, inventory, pricing, competition. For Jere Smith and her husband, Don Lueders, the main thing is health insurance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many small-business owners struggle with the high cost of health insurance, but it is even more critical for entrepreneurs with ventures less than five years old, the time when a business tries to build its clientele and profits. And because many start-ups typically include few employees, if any, they cannot always take advantage of discounted insurance rates that groups enjoy.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of buying health insurance, experts say, is increasingly rattling start-ups that never anticipated the escalating price tag, and in some cases the expense keeps would-be entrepreneurs on the sidelines, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Bill Gates had to worry about health insurance would he have started Microsoft? Who knows,'' said Katherine Swartz, an economist at the Harvard School of Public Health and the author of ''Reinsuring Health: Why More Middle-Class People Are Uninsured and What Government Can Do.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I worry about whether these small businesses will be able to survive, and I worry about what the U.S. economy is going to produce, the types of products and services small businesses will be able to produce in the next decade or so,'' Ms. Swartz said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, Ms. Smith and Mr. Lueders had generous benefits from their employers and gave little thought to how medical care would be paid. But today, as owners of a consulting firm in Liberty, Mo., and a transmission franchise in North Kansas City, it is a constant struggle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we worked for someone else, life was good,'' she said. ''We had plenty of money and health care. Now we live with the constant fear of something. You never know, you just hold your breath. We will probably have one of us go back and get a full-time job at some point.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Premiums for small companies are rising at a faster clip than at larger companies. A Kaiser Family Foundation telephone survey of 2,122 companies released in September found that premiums for small companies rose an average of 8.8 percent this year, compared with a 7 percent rise for larger companies that have more than 200 employees.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Smith said her premiums rose 11 percent this year and that she was now paying about $300 a month in premiums for a high-deductible plan. The couple has to meet a $5,000 deductible each before their coverage kicks in.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josef Blumenfeld, who opened his own global public relations firm, Tradewind Strategies, two years ago in Natick, Mass., has a more comprehensive plan, he said, with low deductibles, but he is paying $1,346 a month for health coverage for his family, including his wife and two children. That is more than $16,000 annually.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Health insurance has become our second-largest expense behind our mortgage,'' he said. ''It's definitely causing me to consider going back into the job market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a 2005 mail survey of more than 600 small businesses by the National Association for the Self-Employed, or NASE, which represents the nation's microbusinesses, 51.1 percent of respondents said they did not or had not planned to offer health insurance coverage for themselves or employees. (The overall margin of error was plus or minus 3.9 percent.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the survey, the smallest companies, grossing less than $50,000 annually, fared worse. About 14 percent of those companies had insurance coverage, compared with 70 percent among those with annual revenue of $500,000 or more. And the smaller businesses pay more, the study found. The small companies spent a median of 18.7 percent of their gross sales on health insurance when they did offer it, compared with 2.3 percent among the higher-grossing firms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cost of health insurance is definitely a big factor in the decision to move toward self-employment,'' said Kristie Darien, executive director for NASE. ''Not only is it a huge cost, but it's also very complicated. There's a natural fear among people that you have to do a lot of research and it still can be very confusing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone thinks the trend is keeping people from taking the entrepreneurial plunge. ''I'm not buying that it is a true barrier. It's a hurdle not a wall,'' says Bill Coleman, senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com, the compensation and benefits data site. If the higher price of health insurance keeps you out of the self-employed game, he said, then you might not be cut out to be an entrepreneur.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to be an entrepreneur, he says, you have to find ways to make your small company part of a bigger group. He suggested looking at a professional employer organization where a small business enters into a type of co-employment relationship with such a firm that essentially employs your workers like a staffing agency would and provides them health benefits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And small-business owners, some insurance experts say, just have to come to terms with the reality of what health plans cost. ''You have Joe who worked for American Airlines and had the richest plan on the face of the earth where everything was covered and now having to start paying for the plan themselves. They are sticker-shocked,'' said Cathy Daugherty, a health insurance broker from Orange, Calif.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they calculate their business plan, she added, some entrepreneurs do not appropriately calculate their health insurance expenses. Do not blame the high cost of health insurance if a small-business owner cannot make ends meet, she said. ''Everything has to be put into the budget like Internet access and rent,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most states are looking at ways to make coverage more affordable, Ms. Swartz said. Many now offer something called high-risk pools that provide subsidized insurance to people who have pre-existing or chronic conditions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Sudow, executive director of the Beachwood Chamber of Commerce in Beachwood, Ohio, said his chamber was part of the Northern Ohio Area Chambers of Commerce that includes 130 Ohio chambers with over 40,000 members, all of them with access to a discounted plan through Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimates that the plan can save as much as 5 percent off rates available on the open market to small-business owners but that includes only those companies that have two or more employees.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He suggested that the first thing a would-be entrepreneur do, especially if he has some sort of health condition, is to sit down with many different insurance agents and come up with a creative plan that fits his needs. And make sure they are experts in small-group and individual policies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of collaboration helped Jere Smith find her recent policy. ''The agent was able to discuss directly with the underwriter. They had a long working relationship. So I feel the agent was able to properly represent us to the company,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Smith loves being an entrepreneur and is happy with her policy right now, although she admits, ''we have had no reason to use the coverage.'' What is worrying her is the uncertainty of future premium rates or whether a major medical issue down the line will be covered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've always wanted to be self-employed but health care is the 95 percent reason we might have to go back to working for someone else,'' she said.   </p>

The plan, which will be financed by reallocating economic development money, requires approval by the state legislature and the federal government. Small shops and local manufacturers have received little help from government programs, which have focused on housing. ''It's a beginning -- we're finally being listened to,'' said Laura Y.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Joseph N. Cooper won a multiyear contract worth up to $8 million to do public relations for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He received the contract through a Small Business Administration program established to increase opportunities for small companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not long after the work was under way, the deal was awarded instead to three multimillion-dollar companies, which were listed as disadvantaged in contract documents. After years of trying to win the contract back, Mr. Cooper filed a false-claims lawsuit against the companies, asserting that they had committed fraud by saying they were small businesses.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, to Mr. Cooper and his lawyer's surprise, the court ruled that although evidence showed the companies were indeed not small businesses, fraud had not been committed because the I.N.S. knew their true status when the work was awarded to the companies -- J. Walter Thompson, the Bernard Hodes Group and Cass Communications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case was dismissed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were floored,'' Mr. Cooper said in an interview. ''The ruling essentially said that I was right, the companies were not small, but so what.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That experience points to the kind of Catch-22 world that some small-business owners face when they challenge the awarding of government contracts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many studies have shown that hundreds of government contracts set aside for small business are being awarded to large corporations. Federal laws provide several mechanisms that allow small-business owners who suspect that contracts have been awarded to large companies to protest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small-business owners say that the rules in many cases impose nearly impossible standards on them. Even if they do succeed in protesting an award, they say, and prove that federal agencies are intentionally awarding small-business contracts to big companies, there are almost no penalties. Often, the large companies get to keep the contacts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a hollow victory,'' said Raul Espinosa, a small-business owner in Florida who has won several protests. ''You might win the size protest, but you can't claim the contract because the agency allowed delivery to take place and what's worse, the penalties for the violations aren't enforced.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Espinosa is leading a coalition of six small-business associations seeking to change the process.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress may be more receptive to their calls for change next year, when two longtime critics of the practice assume leadership positions for the committees overseeing small business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the incoming chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has proposed giving the S.B.A. more time to complete size determinations and to help prevent big businesses from slipping under the radar of a bureaucratic contracting process.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. recently required businesses to report their size every five years. Mr. Kerry's proposal would make the reports annual.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The protest process is supposed to keep the system honest, but what's the point of protesting a contract if nothing happens?'' Senator Kerry said  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of New York and the incoming chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, said she would work to rectify the problems faced by Mr. Cooper and other small businesses by ensuring that there is an effective protest system in place. She also wants to make sure that penalties are enforced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that large businesses are being awarded with small-business contracts, and that there is no system in place with penalties or consequences for this, is extremely concerning,'' Ms. Velazquez said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a small-business owner believes that a company has been illegally awarded a small-business contract the owner has several options in protesting the award.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is to file a so-called size protest with the S.B.A., asserting that the competitor is too big.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under this process, a company has five days after being notified of a winning bidder to initiate the protest. If the agency decides that the winning company is not small, it can recommend that the contract be rescinded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that almost never happens, Mr. Espinosa says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Espinosa protested an Air Force contract, offering documentation showing that the winning company was actually a subsidiary of a larger concern, and thus ineligible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the S.B.A. ruled that the company was a small business, but Mr. Espinosa appealed the decision to the agency's Office of Hearings and Appeals and an administrative law judge ruled in his favor. Despite the ruling, the winner kept the contract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There needs to be some reform in the size protest system,'' Mr. Espinosa said. ''Otherwise, why should small-business owners bother and why would large companies worry about getting caught?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. said it could only recommend that contracts be rescinded and could not compel other agencies to follow the recommendation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albert B. Krachman, a lawyer at the firm of Blank Rome in Washington, who has represented small businesses, said, ''The system is basically set up in such a way that the policing is left up to the businesses themselves.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, he said, ''There is no incentive from the contracting officers or other government officials to see if the companies they are giving small business set-asides to are indeed small-business concerns.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary M. Jackson, assistant administrator for size standards at the S.B.A., agrees that the policing of the small-business contracting system is left up to competitors, but asserts that they are in a better position than contracting officers to know which is a small business and which is not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another remedy for small businesses is through the courts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Cooper did, small-business owners can file lawsuits asserting that fraud was committed in the awarding of set-aside contracts to large businesses. But legal specialists say the filing false-claims lawsuits can be a costly undertaking. The law also contains several legal hurdles that make it almost impossible to win, they say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper said that he was convinced that a lawsuit was his only hope.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Mr. Cooper and his lawyer argued in the Court of Federal Claims that the I.N.S. had not operated in good faith when it stopped giving him work on the contract.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.N.S. said it was not satisfied with Mr. Cooper's work and the cost associated with it. But in a deposition, a contacting officer at the agency said no evidence was ever offered to him questioning the quality of Mr. Cooper's work. A government audit found that the cost was actually reasonable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the court sided with the I.N.S. and said that because the agency had given Mr. Cooper the minimum amount on the contract there was no evidence the agency had not operated in good faith. Mr. Cooper appealed the ruling, but an appeals court upheld the lower court ruling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper and his lawyer then filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. They argued that the two companies that had been awarded contracts to complete the work that Mr. Cooper's firm had originally been awarded had committed fraud when they said that they were disadvantaged businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for the companies, Bruce M. Ginsberg of the law firm of Davis and Gilbert in New York, denies that they ever misstated their size to the I.N.S. ''These are multimillion-dollar companies,'' Mr. Ginsberg said. ''They would not represent themselves as small businesses. We have no idea how they came to be marked that way in the I.N.S. documents.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the evidence offered by Mr. Cooper were contract documents in which the companies were described as disadvantagedand a Justice Department investigative report showing that the companies had verbally confirmed their disadvantaged status with an officer at the I.N.S., though both companies were two of the largest advertising firms in the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought we had a slam-dunk,'' said Cyrus Phillips, a lawyer doing pro bono work for Mr. Cooper.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the judge ruled otherwise, he not only dismissed the case but also ordered Mr. Cooper to pay legal fees and other expenses to the companies he had sued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cooper said the ruling was a fatal blow to his personal and professional life. The legal bills he incurred have left him bankrupt and out of work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did nothing wrong and tried to point out that the government was intentionally giving set-asides to large companies, and I'm the one who pays for it,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''I wish I'd never done business with the federal government.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Just five years ago, Zhang Yin and her husband were driving around the United States in a used Dodge minivan begging garbage dumps to give them their scrap paper.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, who was trained as a dentist, had formed a company in the 1990s to collect paper for recycling and ship it to China. It was a step up from life back in Hong Kong, where she had opened a paper trading company with $3,800 to cash in on China's chronic paper shortages.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember what a man in the business told me back then,'' Ms. Zhang said. ''He said, 'Wastepaper is like a forest. Paper recycles itself, generation after generation.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang took that memory all the way to the bank. As a result of her entrepreneurship, Zhang Yin (pronounced Jang Yeen) is now among the richest women anywhere in the world, including Oprah Winfrey, Martha Stewart and eBay's chief executive, Meg Whitman. Her personal wealth is estimated at $1.5 billion or more, with members of her family worth billions more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her companies take heaps of waste paper from the United States and Europe, ship it to China and recycle it into corrugated cardboard, which is then used for boxes that are packed with toys, electronics and furniture that is stamped ''Made in China'' and often shipped right back across the ocean to American consumers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the boxes are thrown away, the cycle starts all over again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, Forbes magazine named Ms. Zhang the wealthiest woman in China. She may even be the richest self-made woman in the world, challenging a handful of others, like Giuliana Benetton, who started the clothing company with her brothers, and Rosalia Mera, who co-founded Zara, the Spanish clothing retailer, with her former husband.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the world's richest women inherited their wealth: from the Walton women of Wal-Mart fame to the daughters of the men who created Mars candy bars, L'Oreal cosmetics and BMW.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not Ms. Zhang. A petite 49-year-old woman with a cherubic smile and a fancy for diamonds, she started out from a modest background, the daughter of a military officer. Now she dominates the world's paper trade through her giant companies, one centered in Dongguan just outside Hong Kong and the other based in Los Angeles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's a visionary,'' says Herman Woo, an analyst at BNP Paribas, which helped her paper company list shares in Hong Kong. ''She doesn't mind putting a lot of money in at the beginning, to build the company.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That company, Nine Dragons Paper, is now China's biggest papermaker. The company raised nearly $500 million when it went public here last March with the help of Merrill Lynch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, shares of Nine Dragons have quadrupled, giving the company a market value of over $5 billion. (The Zhang family controls 72 percent of the company, which makes it one of the richest families in China.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang's smaller, Los Angeles-based venture, America Chung Nam, is also one of the world's biggest paper trading companies, with ties to recycling yards in New York, Chicago and California.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No other American company sends so much material to China, in as many containers, as America Chung Nam, which was named the top American exporter to China by volume for the fifth consecutive year in 2005, the most recent ranking, according to Piers Global Intelligence, which tracks import and export data.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the paper industry shifting to China, where labor and land are cheaper, Ms. Zhang and Nine Dragons are vowing to take on the world's global paper giants, like International Paper, Weyerhaeuser and Smurfit Stone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My goal is to make Nine Dragons, in three to five years, the leader in containerboards,'' Ms. Zhang says emphatically in a short interview in her glistening Hong Kong office. ''My desire has always been to be the leader in an industry.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In person, Ms. Zhang is filled with nervous energy and hearty laughs. But she rarely grants interviews, and when she does, they are brief and controlled by an army of handlers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang is cagey about how she made her fortune. In a society known for close ties and hidden deals between government officials and business leaders, she says simply, ''I'm an honest businesswoman.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang was the oldest of eight children born into a military family from northern Heilongjiang Province, near the Russian border. During the brutal Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, her father was sent to prison, like millions of others who were branded ''counterrevolutionaries'' or ''capitalist roaders.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Cultural Revolution came to a close in 1976, her father was released from prison and ''rehabilitated.'' She went to work as an accountant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After China's economic reforms got under way in the early 1980s, she moved to the southern coastal city of Shenzhen, one of the first areas in China allowed to experiment with capitalism. There she started working for a foreign-Chinese joint venture paper trading company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1985, she ventured to Hong Kong, which was then still a British colony.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ng Weiting, who was her partner in Hong Kong in the 1980s, says Ms. Zhang was driven and tough and had figured out how to get the best performance out of her workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When her employees asked for a pay raise, she would grant it if it was reasonable,'' he recalled. ''But when her employees made mistakes, she would criticize them severely. She made it clear when to reward and when to punish.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say Ms. Zhang's ebullient personality made her a great saleswoman and a sharp deal maker.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were occasional threats from competitors, yet being a woman was not a problem, she says. "Actually, I didn't find it difficult," she says. "I found men respected me."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Hong Kong's paper market proved too small for her ambitions, she moved to Los Angeles in 1990 and married for the second time, to Liu Ming Chung, who was born in Taiwan, grew up in Brazil and is fluent in English.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, they formed America Chung Nam. At the time, China's fast-growing economy faced shortages of raw materials, and the country began looking overseas for scrap metal and used paper. Zhang Yin was an early mover, one of the first to sell scrap paper to China.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's own paper products are poor quality, often made from grass, bamboo or rice stalks, leaving it at a disadvantage against waste paper derived from wood pulp, the source of most paper made in the United States and Europe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America Chung Nam quickly made deals with American scrap yards and began shipping huge containers of paper back to China. The demand grew so fast that in 1995, Ms. Zhang (who also goes by her Hong Kong name, Cheung Yan) returned to China to found Nine Dragons, opening her first papermaking facility in Dongguan. Mr. Liu now serves at chief executive; Ms. Zhang is chairwoman.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade later, the company has 11 giant papermaking machines, 5,300 employees, $1 billion in annual revenue and a huge facility under construction in the country's other booming export hub, the Yangtze River Delta area near Shanghai. Reported profits last year rose a whopping 349 percent to $175 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine Dragons is now one of the world's fastest growing paper companies, and yet the company says it cannot keep up with demand for containerboard, the material used to make boxes, because of the booming growth in China's economy and exports.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign paper companies have been slow to build a sizable manufacturing base in China. Analysts doubt they will catch up any time soon. And Chinese manufacturers have advantages. They burn cheap coal rather than clean but expensive natural gas. And they are capitalizing on less expensive labor and the newest machinery, while papermakers in the United States and Europe are often using less efficient machines from the 1970s and 1980s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very difficult for U.S. companies to get into this business now,'' says Mr. Woo at BNP Paribas. ''I heard five or six years ago they looked at opportunities but they didn't do anything.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now,'' Mr. Woo adds, ''the largest globally is Smurfit Stone. Weyerhaeuser is No. 2. By 2008, Nine Dragons could be No. 1.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have been nearly unanimous in their praise of Ms. Zhang, though she came under some criticism for appointing her 25-year-old son as a nonexecutive member of the Nine Dragons board of directors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Zhang vigorously defends the appointment, saying her son is qualified and Nine Dragons is, after all, a family company. She has a second son in high school. And her younger brother, Zhang Chang Fei, is the company's deputy chief executive, worth an estimated $900 million, according to Forbes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang jumped to No. 5 this year in the Forbes ranking of the wealthiest people in China, from No. 107 last year, largely because of the huge public stock listing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She hasn't lost her ambition, though. Sometimes called the queen of trash, she doesn't disown the title. But, she said, ''Some day, I'd like to be known as the queen of containerboards.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RAMADI, Iraq, Jan. 16 -- Inside a huge shuttered factory on the gritty western fringes of this outlaw desert town, thousands of ornate porcelain sinks, toilets and other fixtures sit in row after row next to the automated ovens and assembly lines that once churned out the products but lie silent under a thin film of yellow desert dust.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, neither the fancy ceramics nor the machines appear to be damaged, a miracle that no one can quite explain in one of the most dangerous cities of a country that looters have ravaged since 2003.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the explanation, some American and Iraqi officials believe that surviving factories like this one -- once considered inefficient, government-subsidized behemoths -- could present a last chance of sorts for dealing with two problems that have remained stubbornly unsolved since the invasion: Iraq's reconstruction and its insurgency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factories, state-owned enterprises under Saddam Hussein's government, would appear to be the unlikeliest of saviors -- things like a bus factory in an ethnically riven area south of Baghdad, a tomato paste factory in the Kurdish north, and a second plant in Ramadi that makes floor tiles with silk-screened floral patterns. The factories went dark after the invasion for a variety of reasons, including an insistence by the initial American occupation authority that once they closed, vibrant free markets would spring into existence to fill the void.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neither those markets nor the expected commercial and social benefits of the $30 billion American-financed reconstruction program have materialized. So a few officials and local leaders are returning to the shuttered plants in hopes of finding a cheaper way to help the economy and perhaps create jobs to attract young men who might otherwise join the insurgency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dusty old plants are more evocative of guys with lunch pails than the big thinkers who once believed that expensive American reconstruction projects would remake the face of Iraq. ''Any opportunity to re-employ more people and give the government a chance to get income from these factories is important,'' said Sheik Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, an Anbar tribal leader, as he toured the porcelain and tile factories in his flowing black-and-gold robes. ''Especially in this time when Anbar is experiencing terrorism.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheik added, in reference to the idle Iraqis who put the unemployment rate at anywhere from an estimated 30 percent to 60 percent, ''They are normal human beings -- they would rather work than make violence.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ramadi on Tuesday, Sheik Sattar and several Iraqi officials, including the Anbar governor and the manager of the ceramics plant, met with Paul A. Brinkley, a senior Pentagon official who, following up on a tip from the American military command, has taken it upon himself to push the revival of state-owned enterprises that he thinks can be restarted with modest financing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That factory could be running in a week,'' Mr. Brinkley said just after the visit. ''It's amazing to me in this city, after all that this city has gone through, that a factory with that level of robotic equipment is still in that kind of condition.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the meeting -- in an unheated second-floor conference room within a ransacked office building next to the plant -- revealed some of the barriers that this last-ditch effort is likely to face. Those barriers include vast inertia within the Iraqi government bureaucracy and questions about whether even the small amounts of cash needed for the effort will be forthcoming from either Iraqi or American sources.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also serious questions on whether officials in the focus of the United States presence in Iraq, within the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, are ready to support factories that were seen as no more than relics of an era that American ingenuity and reconstruction were going to make forever obsolete.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with so much else in Iraq, there is no clear measure of how extensive the network of state-owned industries is, although the government lists at least 192 companies outside the energy and security sectors. Government and business officials estimate that more than 600,000 employees are still receiving at least some of their salaries, even though almost all of the factories are closed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After presiding over the collapse of that network in the early days of the war, the United States now appears ready to lend some help to Mr. Brinkley's efforts to revive parts of it. Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Scott, who leads the Joint Contracting Command for Iraq and Afghanistan and is based in Baghdad, said in an interview that he was making a push to use Iraqi companies for supplying things like housing and basic services for the American military here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Scott said that although his prime goal was not revitalizing factories, if one of the companies Mr. Brinkley was working with made the right product, it would be given fair consideration. ''It's kind of a version of matchmaking,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How far that process will take Mr. Brinkley's effort is unclear. Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador, said in a recent interview that he was in favor of using military purchases to give Iraqi companies a boost, but that ultimately the United States would promote private enterprise over government entities. "That's obviously the right thing to do,'' he said. ''The question is, how do you get from here to there?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a senior United States official said he believed that at least until recently, officials at the center of American power here, in the Green Zone, had retained their unbending orientation toward privatization. The official said that he asked Americans in the Green Zone why they were buying buses abroad for use in Iraq when a struggling state-owned Iraqi firm in Iskandariya, south of Baghdad, was making a similar vehicle.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The answer was shocking,'' the official said. ''It was, 'We've denied these people access to the global free market for 15 years; I'm not going to go back to them and say that you've got to buy buses from some state-owned enterprise.' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a visit last week to Erbil, in Iraq's Kurdish north, Mr. Brinkley said in a meeting with local officials that when the enterprises ''are laying idle due to our policy of shutting them off, we have an obligation to restore them to the Iraqi people.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the factories comes with different and highly specific challenges, a fact illustrated by the closed tomato paste factory in Erbil, which Mr. Brinkley also visited. With distribution across Iraq before the invasion, the factory limped along for a while afterward and as recently as 2004 produced 804,210 cans -- ''without loss of one can due to quality,'' said the plant engineer, Satar S. Mustafa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, a financial group in Erbil has bought the modest-sized factory, with its shiny chutes, choppers, ovens and other equipment. But the operation is still waiting for what the Erbil group hopes is an American investor, said Azzat M. Othman, who is the group's executive manager and says he worked on Wall Street in various capacities for 25 years before returning home to Kurdistan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we are really looking for is an investor who has an interest in this type of operation,'' said Mr. Othman, who estimates that the factory will generate 100 to 150 jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The porcelain factory is another case entirely. When a worker unlocks a set of big metal doors and slides them back with a boom, a darkened interior perhaps 100 yards in either direction shelters machinery that looks as if it had just been purchased. Half-finished sinks sit in rows along the assembly lines like sculptures left by some artist who intended to return and complete the work with a few strokes of the chisel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is inventory. An assessment by the American occupation officials who shut this factory concluded that it was too small and inefficient to turn a profit in a competitive marketplace, but sinks with paisley and vine patterns look as if they could be sitting on shelves at Home Depot. The toilets are sturdy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iraqis, who intend to keep the plant within the government and say that it could start up again if given an allocation of electricity, insisted that an American take one of the sinks as a sample. It was shoved into one of the armored vehicles belonging to the American military unit that brought the officials here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if everything else here works perfectly, the question hovering over the project is whether the factory will be attacked now that it is associated with Americans. Sheik Sattar, who has already gained fame in Iraq for leading a coalition of Anbar tribes against Al Qaeda, said that would not be a problem.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, he said, the factory has remained in good condition until now. ''We protected it,'' he said. Whether the same assurances can be given for the other factories around the country remains to be seen.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MITCHELL GOSS is a very busy businessman. So busy running his small but growing digital-age business that he did not have time to hunt for the loan he needed to continue expanding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm running the day-to-day aspects, and it's very time-consuming to go out and find the right financial institution,'' he said.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Goss sought help from an organization that he had heard about: the Small Business Development Center at Pace University in Lower Manhattan. His move paid off; an adviser at the center narrowed the list of potential lenders to half a dozen ''that she really felt would sit down with me and listen to my story and take me seriously,'' he said. One agreed to provide the money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goss, 30, is the founder and owner of ZeroIn Media, a three-year-old New York company that installs and manages digital-screen signs. The screens carry general advertising in heavily trafficked public spaces, or, in locations like supermarkets and banks, convey information to patrons about products, prices and services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In going to the Pace center for help, Mr. Goss tapped into a network of more than 1,100 locations across the country where an owner of a small business, or someone wanting to start such a business, can receive free planning, management and technical assistance as well as help in the search for financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sites are part of the Small Business Development Center Program, a national effort that is financed by the federal Small Business Administration, the states and co-sponsors like universities and colleges, where many of the centers and their satellite and outreach offices are located.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have a total of 35 centers as well as additional branch offices where centers cover large geographical areas. There are seven centers in New York City, including the Pace operation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the national program has grown steadily since 1980, when it was established to help spur economic and job growth, and the centers have assisted many entrepreneurs and business owners, many are still unfamiliar with them, economic development experts say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is especially true in immigrant communities, they say, even though many centers are seeking to make themselves better known. (Locations are available through the locator link at sba.gov/sbdc or from the Small Business Administration at 1-800-827-5722.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, some businesspeople who do hear about the centers ''think that we can't be good because we're free, and they will go to their accountants for advice,'' said Ira Davidson, director of the Pace center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most accountants focus on tax-related matters, like maximizing revenue by reducing tax liabilities, he said, while the basic challenges in starting or enlarging a business -- or simply avoiding red ink -- are broader, involving issues like the soundness of the business plan and marketing strategies. The individual counseling offered at the centers is meant to help develop such plans and strategies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pace center says that since its start in 1986, it has been consulted by about 12,000 business owners and would-be owners. Mr. Davidson, the director since 1992, said recently that he did not know how many of those hoping to start or expand businesses actually did so, but that more than $120 million had been invested in the area's economy through start-ups or expansions by clients the center knew about.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goss said he went to the center last year because he needed money for additional operating capital and to add staff members to the dozen he now has.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his company had installed and operates a network of several hundred digital signs around the country, generally ranging in size from 42 inches to 8 feet. Among those that carry general advertising in New York are four in the Pier 17 mall building at the South Street Seaport and about a dozen in the Empire State Building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catalina Castano, an adviser at the Pace center who helped Mr. Goss search for a loan (they both declined to disclose the amount), said, ''We looked at his business's financial situation and his financial situation, and I knew he had a strong case.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERLIN, Jan. 24 -- SAP, the biggest maker of business management software, said Wednesday that it would invest as much as $520 million over two years on an organization aimed at smaller business clients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said the plan for the investment showed that the company had exhausted its lucrative focus on large global corporations.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move, which SAP said would trim its profit margin to 26 percent to 27 percent this year, from a previously announced 30 percent, sent shares of the company plunging as much as 6 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors focused on the cost of the initiative, even though SAP reported that profit rose 29 percent in the fourth quarter, to $1.03 billion, as sales rose 7 percent, to almost $3.9 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the focus on smaller clients showed that SAP's business was maturing and that its days of rapid growth might be coming to an end.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically I think the financial markets are going to have to adjust their perception of SAP,'' said John Segrich, a software analyst at JPMorgan in London. ''In the past, the markets have become accustomed to turbocharged growth rates from SAP, but their core business is changing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two of four quarters in the last year, SAP failed to meet analysts' expectations. For 2006, SAP had predicted that software sales would rise 15 to 17 percent, but sales rose only 11 percent from 2005. Analysts tied the slowdown to reduced business spending on corporate software, the rise of niche competitors nibbling at SAP's market and the saturation of SAP's traditional pool of clients, the large multinational companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAP's chief executive, Henning Kagermann, said SAP was accelerating efforts begun a few years ago to cater to smaller businesses, which were not a priority when the company was expanding to become the biggest software maker in Germany and the third-largest in the world after Microsoft and I.B.M.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kagermann said SAP would aggressively serve smaller clients with its All-in-One business software suite in 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, the company's president, Leo Apotheker, disputed the notion that SAP's profit and sales prospects were dimming, saying that SAP's accelerated focus on small and midsize clients was expected to produce 10,000 new customers and $1.3 billion in new sales revenue by 2010.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't know where this feeling is coming from,'' Mr. Apotheker said. ''We have produced double-digit growth for the third straight year. We doubled our software revenue in the U.S. in three years. We said today that we believe our traditional business will grow at double-digit rates for the considerable future. We just want to accelerate that growth.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Theo Kitz, an analyst at Merck Finck, a private bank in Munich, said SAP's growth prospects peaked a few years ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, founded in 1972, equips 38,000 businesses with software for internal functions like accounting, personnel, sales and executive controls. In a sense, SAP is becoming a victim of its own success, Mr. Kitz said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Serving smaller businesses is more costly for companies like SAP because there are many of them and their needs tend to be more varied, requiring bigger sales and support teams, Mr. Kitz said. Smaller businesses typically also take longer to make buying decisions and require more intensive sales advice than larger enterprises.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt struck a bargain with rural America: In exchange for allowing the creation of national forests, counties would receive 25 percent of the receipts from logging and other resource sales.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, the land would be off limits for development and could not be taxed by state and local governments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, financing fluctuated with the price of timber. Recognizing the stress these market fluctuations put on schools, Congress offered a short-term solution, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, a six-year financing plan that expired in December.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Coast states would feel the pain on the largest scale. Last year the program paid Washington $42 million and California $66 million. Oregon took the most, $149 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School administrators who have depended on the revenue for the last six years say they may be forced to cut staffs and programs. Without a solution, the counties will revert to the old 25 percent-share formula. But 25 percent of what, the school districts wonder.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's un-American for the federal government to walk away from rural communities of America, and we're here to remind them of that commitment,'' said Bob Douglas, president of the National Forests Counties and Schools Coalition, which estimates that nine million children could be affected.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the budget deficit, and spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is difficult to gain support for a solution, said Mark Ray, under secretary of natural resources for the Department of Agriculture.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law will cost West Virginia $2 million if Congress does not agree to reauthorize the program by March.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be very devastating,'' said James Law, superintendent of schools for Pocahontas County, where more than half of the county cannot be taxed or developed because it lies within Monongahela National Forest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have income from homes or businesses because we don't have the population and we don't have the benefit of use of that land for development,'' Mr. Law said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Virginia's state financing for schools is based on the number of students, so low population density hurts the bottom line in rural regions. Rural schools are also spread out over often difficult terrain, meaning districts must pay for long and expensive bus rides.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Forest Service proposal that remains a possible source of revenue is the sale of 170,000 isolated tracts of national forest lands, Mr. Ray said. So far, though, Congress has been unable to agree how the program should be financed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, has introduced a bill calling for reauthorization of the Community Self-Determination Act through the 2013 fiscal year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill in the Senate to continue the program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House legislation has been referred to the committees on agriculture and natural resources.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not just the Pacific Northwest at risk,'' Mr. DeFazio said last week in a speech on the House floor. ''It is hundreds of counties and school districts, from Florida to Maine, all across America, who are at risk.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Douglas, who is also superintendent of Tehama County schools in California, said administrators in nearby Trinity County -- home to Shasta-Trinity National Forest -- might have to lay off staff and school nurses and eliminate library services, arts and music programs and counseling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this money goes away,'' he said, ''there are going to be catastrophic changes.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration yesterday proposed legislation that would reduce payments to farmers by $10 billion over the next five years and cut off support for wealthy ones entirely. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure, which would succeed a five-year agricultural authorization expiring at the end of this year, was described by some critics of current policy as perhaps the most reform-minded farm bill in decades. </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If approved by Congress, it would also reduce some trade-distorting payments that have gotten the United States into trouble with the World Trade Organization, and might put pressure on the European Union to reduce its own farm subsidies, steps that could restart stalled global trade talks. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But aspects of the plan, especially the proposal to cut off payments to farmers earning more than $200,000 a year, are already rankling some farm groups. Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, said farmers would have ''serious concerns'' about that provision. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to get a bigger economy of scale these days to make it in farming,'' Ms. Thatcher said. ''We are all for small farmers, but we are also for what makes economic sense.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the federation's figures showed that the provision would affect 75,000 of the 700,000 farmers who have been collecting farm payments. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference in Washington, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said the reduction in overall spending, to $87.8 billion over five years, reflected the administration's need to tighten the federal budget. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Agriculture Department was able to propose billions in increased spending on some programs because of expectations that prices for commodities like corn, soybeans and wheat would be much higher. That would reduce farm subsidies. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal would increase conservation financing, for instance, by $7.8 billion and direct almost $5 billion to fruit, vegetable and other ''specialty'' growers, who have received little federal assistance in the past. It would also provide $1.6 billion for research and development on cellulosic ethanol, which comes from agricultural waste and nonfood crops. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal would actually increase overall direct payments to farmers by $5.5 billion, or 10 percent, over 10 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it would also reduce large loans that, Brazil and other countries have argued, distort global trade. The United States is already under pressure to respond to Brazil's successful challenge at the World Trade Organization to the American cotton program. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the proposal would save $3.7 billion over 10 years by adjusting cyclical payments that have been based on low commodity prices. Under the legislation, the payments would be based instead on low yields per acre, a system that could aid drought-afflicted farmers who wind up with little revenue. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department noted that under the government's current policies, only 9 percent of all American farms collected 54 percent of all government commodity payments. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One critic of those policies, Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said that ''Secretary Johanns has really planted a flag for reform.'' Mr. Cook, who in pushing conservation has long been on the attack against federal subsidies to large farmers, said the measure was ''the most detailed proposal I have seen in the 30 years I have been working on agriculture issues.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other groups, including the antipoverty organization Oxfam America, also praised the bill for seeking to cut off the richest growers while emphasizing support for beginning and poor farmers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the department faces a tough fight in Congress this spring, with an especially stiff challenge to the provision eliminating payments to wealthy producers. Under the proposal, subsidies would go only to growers who make less than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, a restriction affecting 71,800 farmers of the two million who declared farm income in 2003. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current income cap is far more -- $2.5 million -- and it disappears altogether if at least 75 percent of a grower's income is farm-related. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe has failed in its efforts to cap farm payments according to income. The European Commission proposed such limits in 2002 but withdrew the proposal when Germany and Britain indicated that they would not support it. </p>

He, after all, could remember every Grateful Dead show he ever attended. She, on the other hand, was more interested in women's issues and public policy. She is analytical and reflective and thrives on team-building. He is a free spirit who prefers to work solo.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that did not stop them from trying to build a successful home furnishings company -- and 13 years later, they have more than done it.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We fill in for each other's strength and weaknesses,'' said Margaret A. Traub (a k a the Academic), 48, president and chief executive of Adesso, the company she and Lee Schaak founded in August 1994, with showrooms in New York; High Point, N.C.; Dallas; and Las Vegas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Traub and Mr. Schaak, the Lamp Dude, are as different as well, a professor and an electrician. Ms. Traub, a civil rights activist, was born and bred in Westchester County, N.Y., (her father is Marvin S. Traub, the former chief executive and chairman of Bloomingdale's), and she attended Harvard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schaak, 43, the company's long-haired Hawaiian-shirt-wearing chairman, grew up in St. Paul and went to the University of Colorado, where he spent as much time on the ski slopes as in the classroom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a major concern, going into business together,'' he said. ''Peggy and I are so night-and-day different in every way, so I knew it would bring many extra challenges to the table. And who needs extra challenges? We have enough normal challenges as it is.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, they maintain that their different personality styles actually help them with their business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even if we don't agree, we trust each other,'' said Ms. Traub, who is in charge of operations, finances and marketing, while Mr. Schaak runs sales and product development. (He acquired his nickname because he designs lighting fixtures like the iLamp, which has built-in high-fidelity speakers and a cradle base for an MP3 player or iPod). ''We know that we each have nothing but the best of interests for the company and each other,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Ms. Traub and Mr. Schaak are so different is not uncommon in business. Many co-chief executives often have extremely disparate personality styles. Instead of this being a problem, it can actually work to a company's advantage, specialists say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A business can thrive when it's run by people whose styles are vastly different but complement one another,'' said Phyllis Ezop, a business strategy and marketing information consultant in La Grange Park, Ill. ''If one owner is superorganized and the other is a slob, the business needs to give each one responsibilities that fit their own individual nature.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses can suffer when the personalities are too alike, ''because everyone will be focusing on similar issues,'' Ms. Ezop said. ''Consequently, there will often be gaping holes in managerial capability where the business sorely needs talent with a different style.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a company to succeed, it is not necessary for both leaders to share a passion for opera, French wine and golf. Rather, it is more important for each party to have similar values and work ethics, and the ability -- and desire -- to communicate and resolve issues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter D. Savitt and Bob Cohen are the co-owners of New York Digital Color Lithographers and Printers in Manhattan. Mr. Savitt, 52, is outgoing, gregarious and boisterous, while Mr. Cohen, 60, is more methodical and introverted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tend to think about things before I do them, whether it's dealing with clients or making financial decisions,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Peter has brainstorms and tends to act in more mercurial fashions. He'll come to me with an idea and I'll tell him he's crazy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, they have made it work for four years. Not that they have not had their share of screaming matches: ''There's not a dollar that Peter doesn't like to spend; and there's not a dollar that I don't like to save,'' Mr. Cohen said. Ultimately, though, they operate under a banner of mutual respect. Mr. Savitt controls operations; Mr. Cohen takes care of financials. Together they examine all aspects of a situation when it's time to make a decision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our drive and our passion are both very similar,'' Mr. Savitt said. ''We're both extremely driven and success-oriented and opinionated and we don't lose sight of the fact that we're both on the same team. We both think we're the two smartest people we know.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Sifleet, a business lawyer in Clinton, Mass., has seen dozens of partnerships break up over the 30 years she has been working in her field. The No. 1 reason is that ''they fundamentally cannot resolve differences,'' she said. Typically, the issues play out around money and power.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sifleet often interviews people who are considering going into business together. To get a sense of whether there is a good fit, she asks a series of questions about their goals, ambitions and expectations. What does each partner bring to the table? What are they expecting from each other?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A warning sign is if the partners all want to be president,'' she said. ''If they all want to be in charge and can't agree on roles and responsibilities, a power struggle is ahead.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also asks where they see the company going. ''Often, one person assumes that they'll do this for five years and then sell it, while the other thinks they're doing it for the long haul,'' she said. ''If one partner sees the business going public and the other sees it as closely held over the long term, there's a fundamental difference that will cause conflict.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a relationship to work (and this applies to the personal and the professional), both partners have to put the company first, ahead of their own egos. When the inevitable stylistic clash arises, they must be willing to take a step back and examine the issue with only one thing in mind: What's best for the business?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is how Lisa Hedley and Adriana Mnuchin handle conflict. For the last five years, Ms. Hedley, the president and creative director of the Mayflower Inn and Spa in Washington, Conn., has been working with her mother, Ms. Mnuchin, the chief executive and owner.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Traub and Mr. Schaak do not operate that way. At Adesso, a clear line delineates their responsibilities and they stick close to it: ''We definitely make decisions independently of each other, but over the years, and with some tough arguments along the way, we've learned what decisions can be made unilaterally and which ones need consensus,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they have made adjustments. When conflicts come up, Ms. Traub prefers dealing with them there and then. ''I'm female, I want to talk it out right away,'' she said. ''I like to leave at the end of the day with no issues.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schaak, on other hand, would rather avoid the conversation, go off by himself and create. Buthe has learned to alter his behavior for the sake of the company. ''I can move forward without talking the problem through,'' he said with a laugh, ''but I know it would bite us later.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER 28 years at an electronics plant in her hometown, Mount Pleasant, Iowa, Toni Cory found herself out of a job when the plant closed. Instead of looking for another manufacturing job, she vowed to start a dog day-care and kennel business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although she had dogs of her own, she had no clue where to start. To help, she called on VocationVacations, a company based in Portland, Ore., that enables the curious to spend time trying out potential new jobs. The company hooked up Ms. Cory with Dawn Walton, an owner of the Dog Zone, a dog day care business in nearby Cedar Rapids.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, Ms. Cory had an experience she says she will never forget.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over two and a half days, she walked dogs; she washed them; she groomed them and fed them. When she wasn't dealing with dogs directly, she cleaned kennels, calmed cranky customers and balanced budget sheets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cory returned home, she said, exhausted but fulfilled. Three months later, she opened Almost Home, a dog day care and boarding service in Mount Pleasant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was hard work, but that experience changed my life,'' Ms. Cory said. ''I had a good idea I was going to do doggie day care, but getting out there and doing it was the period at the end of the sentence that convinced me to make it real.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the idea behind VocationVacations -- putting dream careers into practice. The company sells one- to three-day immersions in 110 vocations, ranging from alpaca farming to sports announcing. The experiences are part getaway, part professional development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's president, Brian Kurth, was himself a frustrated marketing executive when he founded the enterprise in 2004. Since then, nearly 1,000 customers have paid $399 to $1,999 for a potentially life-changing experience.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole idea was to create a place where people could try an entirely new career without having to quit their day jobs,'' said Mr. Kurth, who is 40. ''That kind of risk-free freedom and flexibility can be priceless if you're seriously considering making a change.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kurth's service is a commercial twist on an old idea -- mentoring. The small-business world is full of such programs, often free and offered by nonprofit groups, in which business owners provide knowledge and advice to would-be entrepreneurs. The Small Business Administration, for example, sponsors the Service Corps of Retired Executives, or Score, a free program to help young businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VocationVacations differs in its immersive approach. The experience begins when a customer calls or logs on to the company's Web site, vocationvacations.com, and selects a job. The company then connects customers (whom Mr. Kurth calls ''vocationers'') with participating ''mentors'' -- small-business owners who get a percentage of the fee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, the staff members (Mr. Kurth has eight part-time employees) arrange for independent career coaches to chat with customers about their expectations and long-term goals. These meetings are optional, but Mr. Kurth said that most customers have obliged. The coaches are available to meet after the experience, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highlight of every vocation vacation, of course, is the experience. In some cases, customers follow along with their mentors as observers. In others, mentors toss customers right into a daily routine, commanding them to prepare hors d'oeuvres, crunch spreadsheets or clean bird cages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Caulfield, 28, a former real estate agent, took a vocation vacation with the Global Purchasing Companies, a retail fashion buyer in New York, and spent two days following clothes buyers on their chores. A few months later, she opened a women's clothing boutique named Jesse James in Hoboken, N.J.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Grand Forks, N.D., Paul Holje and George Kelley opened Dakota Harvest Bakery after two days of intensive study at Pearl Bakery in Portland, Ore. The men kneaded dough, helped customers and balanced books. Mr. Kelley, 44, a former air-traffic controller, said the experience enabled him and Mr. Holje to experiment with their new careers before jumping in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pearl headed us off from making a bunch of pretty significant mistakes,'' Mr. Kelley said, referring, for example, to preparing for the lunch rush. ''It was more than just an immersion; it was a lesson in how to succeed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The VocationVacations model does not work for everyone, however. Chris Ronan, a systems architect with eMarket Solutions, an Internet company in Dallas, said his experience with Linda Lindsay, the owner of Stone Wolf Vineyards in McMinnville, Ore., was eye opening in a different way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ronan signed up in October 2004, convinced that winemaking was his next career. After spending two days working at the winery, however, Mr. Ronan, 38, said he decided the business wasn't for him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a lot more intensive than I thought it would be,'' said Mr. Ronan, who recounted pulling grapes off a truck, crushing them and working in the barrel room among his activities. ''I learned that if I were to go into wine, I would not want to have to make a living at it,'' but would do it for fun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This kind of disillusionment is not always bad, particularly if it saves someone from going down the wrong career path. Mr. Kurth said that while he aimed to make every vocationer happy, he recognized that sometimes the best thing for a person is to affirm a negative.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just because you don't like something doesn't mean the experience hasn't been good for you,'' he said. ''Better that you try something and learn that you don't like it than make a life change and realize a few weeks in that you've made a total mistake.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The VocationVacations immersion was entirely positive for Bill Sweat and Donna Morris. After 20 years as financial advisers for Fidelity Investments in Boston, the couple retired in 2005 to try something new.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their something was also wine. Mr. Sweat and Ms. Morris were paired with Ms. Lindsay at Stone Wolf Vineyards as well, where they spent two days blending, bottling and making wine. They learned about bookkeeping and other aspects of running a wine business, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were very eager to learn everything,'' Ms. Lindsay said. ''They walked away with enough information to make informed decisions regarding their own future in the business.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two days proved invaluable for Mr. Sweat, 48, and Ms. Morris, 47. Last year, the couple moved to Dundee, Ore., and bought the former Goldschmidt winery, which they renamed Winderlea. Mr. Sweat said they planned to release 600 cases of pinot noir, the winery's specialty, next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, this will make Mr. Sweat and Ms. Morris competitors of Ms. Lindsay's -- a risk that she and most other mentors accept. A handful require vocationers to sign agreements stipulating that they won't open a business within a 50-mile radius.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other risks exist, too. Marci Alboher, the author of ''One Person/Multiple Careers: A New Model for Work/Life Success,'' said that for many VocationVacations customers, one or two days is hardly enough time to get a complete sense of what a new vocation may entail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, all you're doing on vocation vacations is flirting,'' said Ms. Alboher, who lives in New York. ''If you like what you see, it's up to you to take it to the next level and make it into a legitimate career transition exercise.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kurth acknowledged that the experiences his company offered were meant only as ''tastes,'' and that he encouraged customers to seek more training if they were still interested in switching after the immersion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that some customers -- nearly 30 percent, according to interviews -- sign up out of curiosity, and never intend to change careers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Kurth declined to reveal exactly how much his business earned last year, he said that VocationVacations was profitable and expanding. After starting with just a few immersion programs, the company's vocations now have 225 mentors in 35 states.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of these experiences, including cheese maker, clock restorer and voice-over artist, cost less than $1,000 for two days. At the other end of the spectrum, a three-day immersion with Mary Dann, a Southern California wedding coordinator whose clients include Hollywood and sports stars, costs $1,999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kurth said the company would add 30 more immersion experiences this spring, in marine biology, sports umpiring and landscape architecture, among other fields.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as someone has dreamed about a second career, we've probably got an experience that will make that person happy,'' he said. ''It's never too late to give something a try.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF Americans kept a most-dreaded list, audit notices from the Internal Revenue Service would surely rank at or near the top. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners in particular suffer from audit angst, and it is no wonder. The time and money spent to comply can erode the bottom line, even if the audit does not result in additional tax payments or penalties. Moreover, audit rates for individual income tax returns that include Schedule C -- reporting business income of sole proprietors -- are double or triple the overall audit rate of just under 1 percent for individual returns. </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudent business owners can greatly reduce their chances of being audited, tax experts say, while keeping the time and costs to a minimum should it happen. How? By keeping accurate, well-organized financial records, making sure tax returns are properly prepared and reporting all income. Here are some details. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHOW THE RECEIPTS -- Alan E. Weiner, senior tax partner in the Melville, N.Y., office of Holtz Rubenstein Reminick, an accounting firm, cited a favorite target of auditors: the deduction for travel and entertainment expenses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a client has kept a highly organized file of receipts with a note attached to each documenting who was entertained and the purpose, Mr. Weiner said, he could often show the folder with an adding-machine tape of the total on top to the I.R.S. examiner and be done with the audit in 10 to 15 minutes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That example is in keeping with tax professionals' general stance. Taxpayers have the right to take every deduction the law allows them, and the I.R.S. has the right to say, ''Show me.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiner said, ''The burden of proof is on the taxpayer.'' That means good record keeping is essential. Taxpayers who lose receipts, fail to jot down miles driven and other travel costs, or who mix up business and personal expenses are not likely to fare well in an audit. They will generally have to pay additional tax and penalties. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REPORT ALL INCOME -- As important as it is to be able to substantiate deductions, it is even more crucial to report all income. Again, that means careful bookkeeping. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara E. Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., and the author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes,'' said that the I.R.S. tended to focus on small-business income because much of it comes from cash transactions that are not reported to the I.R.S. To ferret out unreported income, agents often compare an individual's Schedule C income to industry studies. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weltman pointed to a three-year I.R.S. study known as ''the tax gap,'' that is, a shortfall of more than $300 billion between what ought to have been reported and what actually was reported. The study, which involved 46,000 audits of 2001 returns and is formally named the National Research Program, was released in 2005 and updated last year. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the study suggests that nearly $110 billion of the gap came from understated net business income -- underreported receipts and overstated expenses. By contrast, employers report wages and salaries to both their employees and the I.R.S. on Form W-2, so very little of that income goes unreported on tax returns. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the business income should have been reported to both recipients and the I.R.S. on Form 1099 for nonemployee compensation, but much is also unreported. Such filing is required of businesses for amounts of $600 or more for services rendered, but there is no such requirement for a homeowner who calls a plumber, for example, to make a repair. Nor would a wholesaler who sold merchandise to a retailer face a reporting requirement, and when the retailer sells the goods to customers, presumably at a profit, again, there is no third-party reporting requirement. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But discovering whether businesses reported all the income that was listed on the 1099s issued to them is a starting place. Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., and formerly a special agent in the I.R.S. criminal investigation division, said, ''My sense is that the I.R.S. emphasis is on tracking down and matching 1099 forms as opposed to intensive scrutiny of deductions.'' He added, ''Because of personnel constraints, it is easier to look at the receipt side as opposed to a more labor-intensive look at deductions.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GET PROFESSIONAL HELP -- Although business owners like to audit-proof their returns, the tax gap and the incentive that gives the I.R.S. to scrutinize returns make that almost impossible. Still, a meticulously prepared return that reports overall business income and profits in line with I.R.S. computer models is most likely not to be an audit target. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Luscombe, the principal tax analyst at CCH, which publishes books and software for tax professionals, said: ''Using an outside person like a certified public accountant or enrolled agent to prepare the return helps. The I.R.S. believes that another set of eyes has looked at the accounts, and the preparer knows he or she is on the hook for accuracy. The I.R.S. has more confidence if a pro did it.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you know something in your return might raise questions, attach a statement explaining it, Mr. Luscombe said. For example, say a retailer lost his lease and moved to a new location. That might entail expenses, and he might run an ad campaign to keep his old customers and attract new ones, making his deduction for advertising out of line with previous years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attach a one-paragraph statement saying that, Mr. Luscombe advised, and perhaps back it up with a copy of the ad agency's bills and an ad or two, ''but don't overwhelm them with a shoebox of records.'' If the I.R.S. ''kicks the return out and a real person looks at it,'' he said, the person may accept the explanation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other professionals also recommended that business owners have their returns professionally prepared, especially given the frequent changes in tax law. Mr. Block said people who prepared their own returns because they could not afford professional preparation could ask a professional to review their completed returns. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Block said he had done this for a fee far below the cost of preparation. He added, ''If you are going to have it reviewed, do so face to face -- that's better than phone or e-mails to avoid mutual misunderstanding.'' </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If an audit notice is received, Mr. Weiner said, ''Unless the amounts are really small, no one should handle his own audit.'' One reason to have a representative is to maintain a sense of detachment. Another is that a professional can say, ''I don't know, but I'll get the answer,'' to an agent, whereas the taxpayer must answer right away. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSIDER USING SOFTWARE -- On the other hand, Bob Meighan, vice president of TurboTax (turbotax.intuit.com), called software ''the wave of the future in tax preparation.'' It is easy to use with a thorough interview to ferret out all income and help the taxpayer find every possible deduction. The software fills out the forms, based on the user's answers to interview questions, and does all the calculations. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TurboTax also offers an optional service, Audit Defense, for $34.95 for a federal return or $39.95 for both federal and state. A certified public accountant or enrolled agent will represent you for a 1040 return, including Schedule C, Mr. Meighan said. Another service is a professional review. It is ''subjective, not hard and fast, to help you navigate through those gray areas,'' he said. It costs $49.95 for returns that include Schedule C. An online version of TurboTax called Personal Pro allows customers to interact with a professional both online and on the telephone. It includes both audit defense and personal assistance and costs $59.95. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACT LIKE A BUSINESS -- One gray area is distinguishing a hobby from a business, especially when it loses money year after year. The I.R.S. will generally give start-up businesses three years to turn a profit, but disallows business losses if it thinks a taxpayer is a hobbyist and not a business person. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes it important to use strict business methods to prove a profit motive. Among the criteria the I.R.S. considers evidence of such intent are: a formal set of books and records with strong internal controls; the use of accounting or financial software; and having separate bank accounts for business and personal income and expenses. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEK HELP ONLINE -- The I.R.S. has considerable help available to business owners who may be at sea with accounting and keeping proper financial records. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A starting place is the Web site irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=158619,00.html, which explains the gap. The Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource (irs.gov/businesses/small/index.html) has information to educate business owners and the self-employed on tax filing and reporting obligations. Also available are online educational products, at irs.gov/businesses/small/content/0,,id=146331,00.html, and two printed guides, Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business and Publication 583, Starting a Business and Keeping Records. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fluharty, 46, had held numerous jobs in marketing with the pharmaceutical giant Bayer, but had always wanted his own tooling business; he had grown up watching his father work in a machine shop in the family's backyard.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the Fluhartys' shop was up and running, with several lathes and a CNC Swiss tooling machine, they faced a problem that many small businesses run into -- how to compete with big companies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the best ways, the Fluhartys found, was through government contracts. Twenty-three percent of the contracts are supposed to go to small businesses, said Calvin Jenkins, deputy associate administrator of the Small Business Administration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the agency has been criticized for awarding large corporations hundreds of government contracts that had been set aside for small businesses, the Fluhartys' experience has been positive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You hear that everything is through connections, almost rigged,'' Mr. Fluharty said. ''I look at it the other way.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses accounted for $79.6 billion of the $314 billion in federal contracts awarded in 2005, according to the S.B.A. In most categories, the agency classifies a small business as having 500 or fewer employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fluhartys, the only employees of their company, easily qualify. They figured out how to negotiate the bidding system, and, a year after buying their tooling machine, they got their first military contract. It was a five-figure job, Mr. Fluharty said, to make brass tubes for lamps on an aircraft lighting system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The military information is out there if you know where to get it,'' Mr. Fluharty said. ''My wife and I know how to get it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further, he said, Federal Express, U.P.S. and other shipping companies make it possible for him to live in his remote location, several miles from a main road.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It couldn't have happened before the Internet and FedEx,'' Mr. Fluharty said. ''The wonders of modern pickup and delivery allow me to compete with -- who knows? -- General Electric,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jenkins of the S.B.A. said, ''You can be anywhere and be as small as you like now, so long as you know how to bid, and most of that is done on the Internet.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's use of databases, which include 400,000 small businesses, has helped. When a bid comes up, qualifying businesses can be notified.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Years ago,'' Mr. Jenkins said, ''we would have a sheet of paper with companies who could do this or that job. Seems awfully antiquated now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he said, companies who want to be listed in the registry fill out applications with standard company information and job history. The administration then tries to match contracts with bidders through the database.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They had been talking about this for years, but finally to have this Internet-based system is a tremendous improvement,'' said John Fisher, 46, the president of Advance Development and Manufacturing Corporation in Guilford, Conn., a company his father founded in 1956 to make machine parts for aircraft carriers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fisher said that his business, with nine employees, was so specialized that he had to watch for every potential contract in the field to not miss any bidding opportunity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We used to have to pore over publications like Commerce Business Daily,'' he said. ''Now we get notified or look on the naval Web site, and the solicitation is there immediately.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, though, the Internet's immediacy can work against small companies when they are competing for business beyond the set-asides. Jalaiah Unnam, the president of Analytical Services and Materials, said that big companies also knew how to use the Internet and databases to enhance their business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they say everyone can compete, then Lockheed and Boeing can compete, too,'' Dr. Unnam said. His company, which provides research for aeronautic projects, had thrived on the requisites in the pre-Internet days of growth: contacts and location. Its headquarters are in Hampton, Va., near the NASA Langley Research Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internet posting of the work his company is awarded gives him many more competitors, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system seems to be getting more small businesses into government work, or at least getting them to consider it, Mr. Jenkins said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Businesses know that getting a government contract is a good marketing tool for getting other business,'' he said. ''We're happy to support that.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEEKS after the Democrats took control of Congress, important issues to small businesses, like the minimum wage and health care policy, top the agenda.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Congress convened on Jan. 4, bills have been introduced to address these matters, including one to require small businesses to offer sick leave to employees; another to simplify tax filing; and one requiring that interest be paid on small-business bank accounts.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions have also arisen about the financing and future of the Small Business Administration, the federal agency set up to help the nearly 18 million small businesses nationwide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the legislative front, proposals to lift the federal minimum wage quickly bogged down over a disagreement on how, or if, the added cost to businesses would be offset. Small-business lobbyists opposed raising the minimum hourly wage to $7.25 from $5.15 over two years, saying that many small businesses could not afford it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrangling continues over whether to link the minimum-wage increase to tax offsets for small businesses, like a credit for small companies that hire disadvantaged workers, including wounded veterans or people living at the poverty level. The House first voted to increase the minimum wage without tax offsets, but the Senate adopted a version that included an $8.3 billion package of tax relief. House Democrats then came up with their own proposals, and the full House approved a $1.3 billion package last week. The final bill awaits House-Senate negotiation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the health care issue, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the new chairman of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, introduced legislation to help small businesses lower their costs for providing health care.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition from small businesses helped sink efforts by the Clinton administration to broaden health care coverage a decade ago. But the issue persists, and health care costs are a top concern of small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his State of the Union address last month, President Bush proposed capping the tax exemption for employer-provided insurance, and allowing individuals to take a tax deduction for their insurance cost. It is similar to some proposals floated by lawmakers, but Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association, said that broader measures were needed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are actively courting change,'' Mr. McCracken said. ''Piecemeal solutions are not going to work. We need to have universal coverage and subsidize people who are least able to afford it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kerry's bill, the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit Act of 2007, is considered an interim step. It would give a refundable tax credit to companies that have fewer than 50 employees and that pay at least half of their workers' health care insurance premiums. The provision would cover employees earning up to $50,000 a year. It is not clear what the chances are for the bill, but it is most likely to be among many proposals tackling the problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also up for consideration is expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which would require businesses with 15 or more employees to provide workers with seven paid sick days. The Healthy Families Act, introduced by the Massachusetts Democrat Edward M. Kennedy in the Senate and Rosa DeLauro, Democrat from Connecticut, in the House, would also cover certain part-time workers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small-business lobbyists say that temporary and part-time workers less invested in their jobs may take advantage of sick leave.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these issues may not be resolved soon, but at least they are on the agenda.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why Pat Simmons, the company's information technology manager, was so perturbed when he noticed that 97 percent of visitors to one page of the Web site were consistently heading for the hills. ''As soon as they came, they left,'' he said.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After analyzing the site, Mr. Simmons realized that the page was not intuitive -- the best products were at the bottom of the page, not the top. Once he reorganized it, people started to stick around.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simmons could see how customers were using (or not using) his site by employing Google Analytics, one of several tools that allow even small businesses to analyze their Web traffic, learning not only how many people visit but also where they come from, where they go and how long they stay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to online retail heavyweights, customers expect e-commerce Web sites to entertain, inform and make transactions a snap.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big story is that the little guys want to be like Amazon,'' said David Thompson, the chief executive of Genius.com, which makes Web site analytic software. As a result, Mr. Thompson said, ''customers assume they'll get intelligent product recommendations whenever they visit a site.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many companies selling so many products, retailers have to make their sites ''sticky,'' said Ramon Ray, the editor of a Web site, smallbiztechnology.com, that helps businesses use technology to grow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ray recommends that owners provide extensive information about their products or services throughout their Web sites. Links to case studies or white papers are ''a good way to bring the story out,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Displaying relevant video clips from YouTube or other Web video services also helps. Short audio clips with a ''play'' button, placed next to a product's logo, can add interest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RSS feeds of appropriate material from other sources can lure customers back, too. A company selling windows, say, could include installation tips from another proprietor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of Goldfish Software, a company that sells accounting software, wanted to customize their site, but they did not anticipate that a feature would take on a life of its own.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldfish incorporated an avatar -- an animated human -- that speaks whenever someone visits the site, goldfishsoftware.com. The company used VHost, a product from Oddcast, to create the avatar, whose face, clothing and speech can be changed by customers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We called the character 'Kate,' but then our customers started calling it by the same name,'' said Judy Thornell, the company's customer-relations executive. ''We didn't realize that they would develop a personal relationship with it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After ''Kate'' started telling customers about the ''hot deals'' listed under a tab on the site, sales for that section went up 50 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having the avatar on the site keeps customers there longer, as they listen to the character speaking,'' Ms. Thornell said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patti Lucia and Desiree Ramos-Aponti, who own Les Beans Coffee, an online coffee retailer, thought a female avatar would complement their products, which have names like Ethiopia Sophie and Costa Rita.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the character speaks with a cooing French accent for Valentine's Day. ''Customers say they look forward to the character of the month,'' Ms. Lucia said. ''It keeps the site fresh.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spicing up a site is worth the effort only if the results can be tracked. Analytic tools can determine not only the number of visitors, but also their state, city or country and type of computer and browser used.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Google Analytics, at google.com/analytics, is a free service that can tie in its tools to Google's AdWords classified ads service, so businesses can learn which keywords drive the most sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each ad word's return on investment can be calculated. Users can learn if a keyword that appeared lower in a list of search results (and therefore cost less) may have actually brought in more money than a more costly one that appeared at the top of the search-results page.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE hanging out a shingle six years ago, Stonebridge Bank, a 50-employee Internet bank in West Chester, Pa., has built up $400 million in assets, virtually from scratch, by managing deposits for Pennsylvania families and lending to small businesses. Its success has also made Stonebridge a tempting target for cybercriminals, who according to the bank make about 100,000 assaults on its Web site each day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George A. Rapp, the bank's director of information systems and a senior vice president, said that a quarter of its $750,000 information technology budget and a third of his staff's time was spent on security-related computers and software and performing security audits. Even so, a glance at his PC revealed yet another attempt, he said, to pilfer customers' account numbers. He would not say whether any hackers had succeeded in breaking into his databases.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are getting attacked heavily,'' he said. ''We assume, every single day, someone's going to break in successfully.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company monitors customers' accounts for suspicious payments, sets up procedures for preserving digital evidence and contacts the F.B.I. in the event of a break-in. Such is life online for a small company trying to stay a step ahead of hackers who are professional, organized and motivated by money rather than fame. Just staying safe can be expensive, and a breach can threaten a small business's existence. The problem is worse for small retailers and mom-and-pop shops with e-commerce sites, which often cannot afford full-time technical staff or corporate controls.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small retailers are among the lowest spenders on computer security, along with farms and mining companies, said Steve Quane, a general manager at Trend Micro, a computer security company that has surveyed the cybersecurity of several thousand small and midsize companies since 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web-based programs, including some that support e-commerce sites and blogs, accounted for more than two-thirds of the exploitable vulnerabilities that came to light during the first half of 2006, according to a report by Symantec, a maker of security software. Hackers attempted 33 million attacks each day worldwide during those six months, and the number of new vulnerabilities rose 20 percent compared with 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are seeing a lot of small-business cases,'' said Mark Culp, a supervisory special agent at the F.B.I.'s cyberdivision in Washington. ''The No. 1 motive for these attacks right now is financial.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of the latest hacking wave is to break into computers that house e-commerce sites in search of credit-card information or lists of customers' names, account numbers and log-in information. This data is either sold to other criminals or used to withdraw money or buy goods on the spot. In some cases, the crooks are current or former employees of the company, or they are competitors trying to knock a site offline or hold data for ransom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Culp said that hacking was more sophisticated and harder to detect than a few years ago. And obscurity is no safety guarantee for small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the hackers think you have credit card numbers they can sell or use, they're going to target your Web site,'' he said. ''That information should be encrypted. If companies aren't doing that, they're asking for trouble these days.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the array of nasty behavior online, what's a small-business owner to do? The first thing, security experts said, is to pass credit-card data directly to a processing company rather than storing it on company servers, which attract hackers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Culp of the F.B.I. said that another imperative was to install firewall software on each computer, and keep PCs' antivirus software current. Companies with wireless networks should use the latest wireless data encryption standard, called Wi-Fi Protected Access. And employees should have access only to the systems they need to do their jobs, and follow clear policies about not downloading suspicious e-mail attachments and free software.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New forms of online danger for small companies continue to emerge. On the rise this winter are e-mail- and Web-borne attacks using software that lodges itself on small-businesses' networks, then scouts for Microsoft Word and Access database files, said Gunter Ollmann, director of security strategy at Internet Security Systems at I.B.M. When it finds them, the software can encrypt those files and direct the victim to a Web site where hackers demand payment to unlock them. ''There's a high scare value to this,'' Mr. Ollmann said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yuval Ben-Itzhak, the chief technology officer at Finjan, whose security software is used by Delta Air Lines and the Walt Disney Company, and whose technology is licensed by Microsoft, predicted there would be an outbreak of infections aided by new encryption technology that can elude traditional antivirus software. Attacks on small businesses represent less than 1 percent of the hacking that targets a specific industry, Symantec said. But ''the impact on small and medium business tends to be more dramatic,'' said Alfred Huger, senior director of engineering at Symantec. Small businesses often outsource the development and maintenance of their Web sites to small consulting shops, which can be lax with security.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses also take technical risks that can increase their vulnerability. Many use open-source software, which is free on the Internet, for parts of their e-commerce sites like databases, online shopping carts, inventory management and user forums. Some of that software, because it is written by relatively unskilled programmers, has a poor security record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of stuff you can get on the Net to help you do business online,'' Mr. Huger said. ''Unfortunately, a lot of it isn't very secure.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Paller, the director of research at the SANS Institute in Bethesda, Md., which tracks cyberattacks and offers Internet security training courses, said that small companies often used Web-serving software built into Microsoft's Windows operating system, along with Microsoft's database software, on the same computer. Meant to save money, this combination poses risks because it might enable hackers to exploit flaws in the Web server to gain access to a company's database.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Almost all little companies do that,'' Mr. Paller said. ''They're low-hanging fruit for the bad guys.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, those bad guys aim right for the companies' database of customer information, issuing commands to database software to try to take control.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That can be a very effective and easy thing if your site's poorly designed,'' said Mr. Rapp of Stonebridge Bank. The open-source PHP computer language -- favored by many small companies because it is easy to use -- is a big source of database holes. Security experts also see an emerging threat from the popular Ajax technology, which combines JavaScript and the XML computer language to create fast-running Web sites that act like desktop programs. The trouble is, these sites contain lots of code that communicates with a company's databases, thus presenting risks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What most hackers are looking for is value versus publicity,'' said Marcus H. Sachs, a deputy director in the computer science laboratory at SRI International, a research firm in Arlington, Va. ''The value is in the database, not the Web site. That's where the money sits.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, the Small Business Administration, which provides most long-term rebuilding aid to disaster victims, accelerated its lending to homeowners and businesses in the Gulf Coast, responding to criticism that it had been slow to respond to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now federal investigators are looking into accusations that in speeding up its work, the agency made thousands of loans without following its own rules to avoid fraud. Current and former employees of the agency have told investigators that agency workers failed to secure proper proof that borrowers owned the houses they were supposed to rebuild or had the required insurance.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caroline Pankove, who worked as a lawyer for the disaster-loan program at the agency from June through December of last year, complained to the agency's managers and its inspector general that employees were improperly pressured to approve loans quickly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan policies were applied inconsistently, Ms. Pankove said, and disaster victims' paperwork was often misplaced or mailed out with errors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rush to disburse loans put everyone at risk: the taxpayer, the agency and especially the borrowers,'' Ms. Pankove said in an interview. ''The people that we needed to serve the most were the ones getting hurt the most.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her complaints were echoed by Brian Cook, who worked at the agency as a paralegal last year, and by others who spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were still employed by the agency at the disaster loan office in Fort Worth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the agency's inspector general confirmed that his office was looking into the accusations but said he could not comment on a continuing investigation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agency officials said that they were taking the complaints seriously, but that the problems described by Ms. Pankove and others were isolated, not systemic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We never pushed for disbursement to be made without the proper documentation,'' said Steven C. Preston, who promised to reform the troubled disaster loan program when he was appointed administrator of the agency last summer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency was trying to empower managers to make case-by-case judgments about loan documentation, Mr. Preston said, adding, ''We can't have a cookie-cutter approach.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston also disputed the possibility that efforts to speed the process had opened the door to abuse. ''Of course we want to get the disbursements out faster,'' he said, ''but it's very dangerous to assume that this would lead to fraud and losses to the taxpayer.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Preston took over the agency in July, he inherited a huge backlog of loan applications, which had grown to 94,000 by September, according to the agency. Since then, 51,000 people have received all the loan money they qualified for, 19,000 have gotten some, and 24,000 have canceled their applications.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency has made more than $5 billion in hurricane-related disaster loans, more than half of them since Mr. Preston took over, said Sean Rushton, the assistant administrator for communications.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way the agency reduced its backlog was by rewarding the employees who got money into the hands of the largest number of borrowers. E-mail messages obtained by The New York Times promised cash bonuses and overtime to the most productive workers, even though at least one supervisor acknowledged that this emphasis made people uncomfortable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will be honest,'' a supervisor, Michael V. Cremer, wrote in an e-mail message in October. ''Disbursements = cash awards &amp; overtime opportunity. I don't like it, you don't like it but it is what it is.'' The message continued, ''Work with your people to make these numbers look good.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cremer did not respond to voice mail messages left at his agency office in Texas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders of the House and Senate committees overseeing the agency said they were concerned about the accusations of improper lending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm worried that there may have been too much of a focus on quotas over quality of service for disaster victims,'' Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a statement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And if that's true, it's unacceptable,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''If in a rush to get paperwork off their desks the S.B.A. shifted the burden to borrowers who have lost everything to Katrina, that's not a policy, that's an abdication of responsibility.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the agency's new emphasis on speeding the lending process, disaster victims say they continue to experience problems. Donna Colosino, whose family owns a small company in Louisiana that sells power generation equipment, told the House Small Business Committee earlier this month that more than 20 loan officers had dealt with her case. And she said she sent the same documents to the agency more than a dozen times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Working with S.B.A. after a disaster is like having a second job,'' Ms. Colosino said. ''I swear to you on my father's grave that this is the story. I am not an anomaly.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I waited for a blank noon on one of those Southern California days that are like a shallow bowl filled with almost nothing, a day when the main event turns out in retrospect to have been lunch at Donut &amp; Burger. I placed my order at the walk-up window. Two young men sat at a table by the sidewalk, and once or twice I caught the humid brush-fire scent of burning cannabis. I ate in the truck with the windows down, looking at a vacant lot next door through a chain-link fence. The view seemed to say more than I wanted to hear about dietary anomie and the kind of day this was turning out to be.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the grass beyond the fence parted, and a head poked up. Then more heads. The vacant lot wasn't vacant at all. It was occupied by a prosperous colony of ground squirrels -- Spermophilus beecheyi, named after the English explorer Sir Frederick William Beechey, who visited California in the H.M.S. Blossom 180 years ago. I did not know about Sir Frederick at the time. I knew only that these were ground squirrels and that this vacant lot was a ground squirrel subdivision and that I had just eaten a burger and a doughnut for lunch in the city of Pomona, Calif., which is named for a minor Roman goddess of tree fruits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What surprised me were the burrows. They were mounded at the entrance, like the burrows you'd find in a Wyoming prairie dog town, and they somehow turned the vacancy of that empty lot into habitat. The squirrels stood guard on their haunches and raced from hole to hole. Almost instinctively I found myself imagining their tragic history, composing the saga of the ground squirrel in my mind. This was a relict population -- the last of a dying breed, cut off from their kind by the unconscious savagery of human encroachment, their world now bounded by an auto parts store, a busy highway, the back alley of an apartment complex and the parking lot of Donut &amp; Burger. The San Gabriel Mountains loomed impossibly distant for them. I wondered if they had been reduced to eating fries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you don't have to read very much about Spermophilus beecheyi -- never mind Sir Frederick William Beechey -- to realize that California ground squirrels are nearly human in their adaptability. And like all creatures that are nearly human in their adaptability, humans consider them pests. Ground squirrels invade gardens and damage plants. They can carry bubonic plague. They destroy the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their burrows can extend for dozens of feet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I found myself telling a new story. The ground squirrels in that vacant lot are colonists, opening new terrain to an expansionist species, developing the site before the human developers can do so. Perhaps this is one of a series of vacant lots scattered across the Los Angeles basin, an archipelago of ground squirrels quietly shaping the earth to suit their needs. They watch the humans eating at Donut &amp; Burger and know their time will come.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squirrels reminded me of my last flight to Wyoming. I changed planes in Denver, and during the layover I watched a small flock of sparrows -- five or six -- that were living in one of the terminals. They betrayed no anxiety, no frantic fluttering toward the lights or windows. They behaved exactly the way sparrows do when they're at home. They flew up to an architectural strut and preened, and then flew down to the carpet and hopped across the waiting areas, silently scavenging for food. I imagined a separate species of sparrow evolving over the years to come, breeding quickly, adapting precisely to the conditions inside Denver International Airport.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I drive past Donut &amp; Burger from time to time on my way to the freeway. I look into the lot and try to catch sight of the squirrels looking out at the traffic. Perhaps they know what an idle concept vacancy really is. I catch the Foothill Freeway a mile or two north, and I notice, again, how common it is to see hawks soaring high overhead. Now I know what they are feeding on.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MISSOULA, Mont. -- Last wishes notwithstanding, federal officials are opposed to a Montana woman's plan for a business that would spread the cremated remains of her clients over western Montana's publicly owned wild mountain peaks and flower-studded meadows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Fran Coover, her new business, Ladies in White, seemed a perfect way to blend her interest in the environment and alternatives to the American way of dying. ''It's much less expensive,'' Ms. Coover said. ''And it is far more environmentally benign.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $390 Ms. Coover, a former administrator at a project studying end-of-life care here, along with two other ladies, offered to scatter the ashes of clients and provide a ceremony, a photograph, journal notes and Global Positioning System coordinates of the final resting place. Ten percent of the cost would be donated to groups who work to protect wild lands.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after Ms. Coover scattered the cremated remains of her first client, she applied to the federal Forest Service, one of Montana's largest owners of wild land, for a special-use permit to continue her business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some officials told her it was fine to scatter the ashes on public land, she says, officials from Region I of the Forest Service, which covers Montana and Idaho, said it was against national policy and denied a permit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She took her request to the Bureau of Land Management, the largest of the country's federal land management agencies. At first the bureau seemed fine with it, she says, until it sent out an e-mail message to stakeholders, or groups with an interest in public lands, and ran into opposition from Indian tribes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exasperated at the barriers, Ms. Coover said, she is preparing appeals. ''Three women in white dresses and hiking boots want to carry a pack on their back into a wilderness area,'' she said. ''How harmful can that be? Does it make sense for people to have land they love logged or torn up by mines, but not available to have ashes scattered?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Forest Service has long had a firm policy against commercial scattering, said Gordon Schofield, the group leader for land use here in Region I. If ashes are scattered ''the land takes on a sacredness, and people want to put up a marker or a plaque,'' Mr. Schofield said, then they oppose activities they do not see as compatible with the site as a resting place.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Forest Service has a version of a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for private individuals who want to scatter the ashes of a loved one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't prohibit it, but we don't authorize it,'' Mr. Schofield said. ''People should do what they think is right.'' But an allowed commercial enterprises require a permit, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilderness Watch, a conservation group, opposes dissemination of human remains in wilderness areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I understand wilderness is sacred ground and many people feel closer to the Creator there than they do in church,'' said George Nickas, the group's executive director. ''But it's also a place where commercial enterprise is not allowed. I think the prohibition on Ladies in White is the right thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nickas said he would allow the women to scatter ashes on public land that is not wilderness because ''we allow all kinds of commercial activity'' on such land.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As people turn to nontraditional ways of disposing of their loved ones' remains, ash-scattering businesses have blossomed. Families can choose to have ashes scattered in a variety of ways, including from a helium balloon or an airplane flying over an ocean or a volcano.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Britain, a company called Heavens Above Fireworks, sends remains into the sky in ''a spectacular fireworks display.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While she appeals the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management decisions, Ms. Coover said, she is negotiating with a private landowner, a rancher, to scatter ashes on his mountain property.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cremation is growing by the year,'' she said, ''and people are looking for a place to scatter. The public land is public legacy, and it's where ashes belong.''   </p>

The February snow stacks up on the boat docks of Harris Harbor, but cannot match the knee-length brown rubber boots Laurie Lindsey wears.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lindsey, 50, climbs onto the Kirsten Anne, a 49-foot ketch that sleeps eight and has been around the world twice. She is a 50-year-old entrepreneur with short black hair, long earrings, a quick smile and few wrinkles, despite 20 years working outside and one failed business. She started as a cook on a crab boat that fished year-round on the Bering Sea and by the late 1980s, she and her husband at the time, Glenn Organ, had their own commercial fishing business.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit card companies and banks categorized her as self-employed and in a high-risk business and would give her neither a credit card, nor a business loan. Then salmon prices plummeted and her company was sued by a crew member. ''We had a seaman's injury case,'' she recalls. ''It was fraudulent, but it took us over the edge, and we pretty much lost everything in 1993.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years later, Ms. Lindsey had recovered financially and started a new business on her own, a sailing charter that takes scientists and tourists around Southeast Alaska. Ms. Lindsey says being a woman business owner is easier now. ''Things have changed incredibly in the last 20 years.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, progress, especially in Alaska, has been slow. A December 2006 study by the Center for Women's Business Research in Washington, shows that in Alaska, women hold majority stakes in about 17,000 private enterprises. That is about 26 percent of all the state's businesses, and that puts Alaska toward the bottom nationwide when it comes to business ownership by women. By comparison, in Washington, 35 percent of all businesses are owned by women. In Maryland, and Hawaii they own almost one-third.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwen Martin, the center's research director, points to the macho businesses that dominate Alaska's economy. ''The construction industry is huge, transportation and warehousing are big,'' she said. ''Those are fields dominated by men, and that may be one reason for fewer women-owned businesses.'' Nationwide, Ms. Martin says, women are starting to make inroads into these fields.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors like to compare Juneau to San Francisco, with its steep, winding streets and public staircases of hundreds of steps that lead to century-old clapboard cottages trimmed in pastels and clinging to a mountainside long ago settled by gold miners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks from the harbor, the historic Silverbow Inn is a European kind of place, a cultural center whose lobby has a mix of period photos and posters advertising arts events. It serves strong coffee, fresh bagels with salmon from a nearby smokehouse, shows independent films and is expanding.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Ramiel, formerly of New York, owns the Silverbow Inn with her husband, Ken Alper. Showing off a gallery space recently, while an electrician installed track lighting, Ms. Ramiel said she planned to display local artists and about 20 of them have inquired about the space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, she came to Juneau from Seattle, after finishing a master's degree in architecture. At first, she said, she wanted to open a luncheonette, but fell in love with the 93-year-old structure, known as the Messerschmidt Building, and saw it as a bagel shop and inn. She was 29, though, and did not have much collateral or any experience making bagels, but had a notion of how small business worked. Her grandmother used to run a liquor store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramiel managed to persuade a local banker to lend her about $500,000 to buy the building and adjacent restaurant. In 2006, she went to the same banker and the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state lending agency, for $900,000 to upgrade and expand the inn's number of rooms to 11.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramiel is surprised to hear that Alaska is tough for women entrepreneurs, but acknowledges that she is treated differently from her husband, who owns a minority stake in the business and runs it with her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's an expectation for me to wake up every day, put a smile on my face, and be chipper and supportive, even when things are going wrong all around me,'' she said. ''Sometimes I'm at my desk thinking about how to solve a problem and someone will walk by and say 'Smile,' but they wouldn't say that to my husband.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding workers has been a struggle. At the start, she imported friends with skills. One owned a bagel shop in Morristown, N.J. Ms. Ramiel went there for a month to see how to make a traditional-style bagel and persuaded her friend to pack up his family and move to Juneau. Another friend, a chef trained at a culinary school, moved from Seattle and worked the grill.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a smaller labor pool in Alaska,'' Ms. Ramiel said. ''Now we find people we like because of their attitude and then write job descriptions to fit their skills.'' For instance, the bagel maker is a college student who arrives whenever his schedule allows, often in the middle of the night.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaska is a giant state that spawns grand myths. One of them holds that men way outnumber women. In a few rural communities they do, but statewide the gender makeup is almost balanced. In Anchorage, women actually outnumber men, according to the 2005 American Community Survey. That has not made business any easier for Sharon Athas Cote, 43.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cote, reached by phone at her Anchorage headquarters, says she dislikes complaining about troubles women face winning contracts and was reluctant to become certified under the federal government's 8a procurement program. It is intended to give women and other disadvantaged entrepreneurs a leg up in bidding. Her construction and trucking business -- SBH Services -- qualifies because it is 51 percent owned by women. Having the status can make a big difference in Alaska, where federal contracts on military bases and for infrastructure projects add up to billions of dollars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then three years ago, Ms. Cote was bidding on a landscaping and construction job and went to interview for the project. ''I had to listen to the company owner lecture me for about a half an hour about how women were taking jobs away from men. He said for that reason, he wouldn't give me the work,'' she recalls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cote walked out, called her husband and said she was going to apply for the preferential bidding status, which she now has. ''I try to differentiate myself through service, but the 8a status has opened a lot of doors for me.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, Europe is pulling ahead. The current takeover battle in banking, the biggest in the industry's history, is just the latest sign of the growing deal frenzy on the Continent.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That frenzy is prompting changes in corporate behavior. European companies are scrambling to put themselves in play, or fend off unwanted approaches, much like American companies did in the 1980s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's deal mania reflects a number of trends: more active shareholders, particularly hedge funds; an influx of private equity money; low interest rates; and a wealth of European companies with valuable assets that are ripe for the picking, in some cases because they have been poorly managed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Shareholder activism and hedge funds are acting as a trigger to doing more restructuring kinds of deals,'' said Alexander Dibelius, the head of Goldman Sachs in Germany. ''In combination with private equity and cheap money, this adds to the perceived increase in deal making."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is more than just perception. So far this year, the value of mergers and acquisitions announced in Europe is $656.4 billion, compared with $601.4 billion in the United States, according to Thomson Financial (Europe also led in 1990, 1991 and 2002).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's new economic buoyancy is also providing a tailwind to dealmakers here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth rates in Europe are approaching those in the United States, and Europe may outperform the United States this year if the American economy slows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany, in particular, is booming, with soaring investor confidence and heavy capital spending. Companies are reporting record profits, as they reap the benefits of years of painful overhauls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having retrenched thoroughly, European companies are emerging with leaner cost structures and loftier ambitions. The German energy giant, Eon, for example, made a 42 billion euro ($57 billion) bid for its Spanish counterpart, Endesa -- a deal that eventually collapsed because of resistance by the Spanish.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deal underscores a hurdle to deals in Europe, particularly cross-border ones: protectionism is alive and well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political leaders in France, Italy, and Spain speak unabashedly about keeping national assets from foreign buyers. Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative front-runner for the French presidency, promises to maintain France's tradition of defending ''national champions'' in crucial industries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Germany, the former head of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Muntefering, scored points during the last election by referring to foreign hedge funds and private equity investors as heuschrecken, or locusts, intent on plundering German assets and mistreating workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While European executives are generally more open to cross-border deals than politicians, some play the nationalist card when it suits them, to ward off unwanted suitors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porsche, the German sports car maker, has amassed a more than 30 percent stake in Volkswagen, justifying its action by saying it is trying to fend off a potential takeover by foreign private-equity investors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears of hostile approaches by financial investors have helped fuel the efforts of DaimlerChrysler to unload its money-losing Chrysler division, according to executives at the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may have even played a role in the abrupt ouster Wednesday of the chief executive of Siemens, the engineering giant, which has been hit by a corruption scandal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with ties to Siemens said members of its board were worried that if it did not get past the scandal, the company would be vulnerable to a takeover bid by a private equity firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is ample evidence that hedge funds and other foreign investors are shaking Europe out of it old habits.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ABN Amro's negotiations with Barclays were started in part by pressure from the Children's Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, which owns less than 3 percent of ABN Amro.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, bankers here said, it would have been inconceivable for a hedge fund to force one of Europe's largest banks to, in effect, put itself in play.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2005, the Children's Investment Fund waged a fax and e-mail campaign against the management of Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, which was seeking to take over the London Stock Exchange.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only did Deutsche Borse end up having to abandon the bid, but the company's chief executive and its chairman were forced to resign.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Central Bank has done its part to keep business humming. While the bank began tightening credit at the end of 2005, its key rate of 4 percent is still below that of the Federal Reserve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists expect that the bank will move cautiously in raising rates further.   </p>

Outside of disruptions caused by labor strikes, G.M. had led the pack for over 75 years. While hardly a cause for celebration in the American business community, Toyota's assumption of the crown -- after selling 2.35 million cars and trucks in its most recent quarter -- is not quite as bad as it appears.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a very important sense -- profitability -- G.M. had not been on top in some time. It fell behind in volume last quarter, by 109,000 vehicles, largely as a result of deciding to reduce its unprofitable bulk sales to rental-car companies and dialing back some of its costlier incentives. More important, analysts say that G.M. has awakened to the challenge posed by Toyota and, although more difficult results lie ahead, the company may finally be moving in the right direction.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As global competition heats up, Americans will have to get used to having more of their companies fall from the top spot. How businesses respond will in no small way determine how well the United States succeeds in a world where it is no longer the unchallenged economic superpower.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major reason that so many American companies were world-beaters in the last century was the unmatched size of their rich and relatively homogenous domestic consumer market, big enough by itself for mass production, and bequeathing all the advantages of economies of scale for competition abroad. The United States economy is still the largest in the world, but ravenous young markets in places like India and China -- each with well over three times the population of America -- make clear that it will not stay that way forever. There will be ever more competitors from all over selling all over, and ready to knock off those in the old guard if they make the wrong choices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is no reason for American business to despair; instead, it has to refocus on how to stay competitive in a world beyond American dominance. Germany's recent success might serve as a model. As Mark Landler wrote in The Times recently, Germany, with the world's third-largest economy, has been the world's largest exporter of goods the last four years. And, Americans who believe protectionism is needed to level the playing field should note, it has managed to do it without cheap labor. German businesses have prospered with a focus on quality and strong brands, and particularly with sophisticated niche products, from lasers to Porsches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's recent success was not accomplished painlessly. There were wrenching layoffs and rounds of cost cutting and outsourcing along the way. General Motors faces a particular set of challenges because in the mass-market automobile game, the huge upfront costs of designing and building cars make sales volume crucial. But Germany's export prowess proves that for a smart industrialized country, many small successes can add up to No. 1.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSINESS owners who want to offer benefits like health insurance and tax-deferred retirement plans for themselves and their employees face two daunting hurdles: high costs and complicated federal laws intended to prevent plans from discriminating in favor of top employees.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consequently, many small businesses forgo offering benefits. But that is often not the best choice, either for the owner's own security or for attracting and keeping strong employees. Barbara Weltman, a lawyer and small-business specialist in Millwood, N.Y., answered questions on how business owners could make wiser choices on benefits.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has written numerous books on small businesses, including J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2007 and J. K. Lasser's Finance and Tax for Your Family Business. She also publishes an online newsletter, Big Ideas for Small Business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What role do benefits play for small-business owners?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They're critical now because it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract good help. Boomers are retiring, and the unemployment rate among college graduates is just over 1 percent. When you are trying to get that brain trust together, you are almost forced to offer benefits to get the best and the brightest. But small business has a tough time competing with big businesses that can offer big menus of benefits. Health care is the most expensive, and small businesses pay higher premiums per person than do large corporations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How are small businesses addressing the problem of providing health insurance?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Health savings accounts are growing in popularity. They go hand in hand with high-deductible health insurance plans. The minimum deductible amount changes every year. This year it is $1,100 for an individual or $2,200 for a family. A company with 15 employees can save 40 percent over a traditional policy if they make the maximum contribution. By law, either the company or the employee can make contributions to the savings account, or they can split the contributions. Whoever makes the contribution gets the deduction, but the amount in the health savings account belongs 100 percent to the employee. If employees leave, they take it with them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What other benefits should be considered?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The No. 2 benefit is retirement savings. Large and small businesses across the board have moved away from old defined-benefit pension plans to defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s. Under the Pension Protection Act, starting in 2008 employees can be enrolled in 401(k) plans automatically, and employers will have to make a matching contribution. It is not a giant number and will allow owners to set aside money for their own retirement without having to go through all that testing to make sure their plans are nondiscriminatory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What does ''nondiscriminatory'' mean?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The plan can't benefit owners to the exclusion of rank and file employees. The tests are very cumbersome.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are there other options for retirement savings?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Small businesses have options like Simple plans (Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees of Small Employers, those with 100 or fewer employees). Employees can contribute up to $10,500 each in 2007 (plus an additional $2,500 if 50 or older by year end), and employers match up to 3 percent of wages. The plans are much less expensive to set up and administer than larger retirement plans. In a local deli, for example, the owner offered a Simple plan to give employees the option to save for retirement. The cost to her was modest. Personally, she could not maximize what she could save, but she could save more than she could with an I.R.A.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What can business owners do to save more for retirement?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They need to be disciplined about setting aside after-tax money. They can invest in an annuity or a personal portfolio of stocks, bonds or mutual funds or in real estate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. So business owners have latitude in deciding whether to provide health insurance and retirement plans. Are there any benefits they have to offer?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Short-term disability and workers' compensation insurance are required by all states. Also, employers must pay unemployment insurance. It's paid like a federal and state tax, but unemployment benefits are administered by the states. Also, some states and localities have requirements even when federal law does not. Massachusetts, for example, is requiring employers with more than 10 employees to provide health insurance starting July 1 or pay a per-employee assessment, and, as of Feb. 5, San Francisco requires paid sick leave.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What about long-term disability insurance?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It is absolutely important for business owners to have long-term disability insurance, and it can be offered on a discriminatory basis. If the company arranges a group plan under which employees can choose whether to pay for their own coverage and the company pays nothing, then it doesn't matter if only the owners and/or highly paid employees opt to do so. However, if a company offers this benefit as an option in a cafeteria plan, then participation in the cafeteria plan must be open to employees on a nondiscriminatory basis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What else can small businesses offer that do not run afoul of the anti-discrimination rules to help them compete for employees?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Many give employees wider responsibility and more flexibility than they would have in a big business. A small-business owner can be creative in devising benefits that are appreciated, often with a personal touch, such as small bonuses or token gifts to thank employees for suggestions or graduation presents for employees' children. It may be possible to allow people unlimited sick days. Employees love time off -- an employer could give an employee time off as a reward for a job well done or to take a child to a doctor. Flex time and allowing employees to work off-site can be an extremely valuable incentive -- it's win-win for everyone -- even for the environment. Workers are not commuting and thus not polluting. And once a small business gets this arrangement in place, you can pay less for space.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS is the month when businesses compete for the best summer workers, from a pool of students and older people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses can win by offering interns opportunities to do a greater variety of work and more responsible tasks than they might do in a big company, and by stressing the personal connection with the top people in the business, advisers say. These professionals discussed three approaches to getting top-quality summer help.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEK INTERNS -- ''Instead of looking at an intern simply to fill a summer slot, think strategically about your future,'' said Amy Van Kirk, director of campus recruiting for  <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, the accounting firm. ''Find someone and invest the time to coach and train that person,'' she said. That way, ''you build your own manpower. They will come back, so you don't have pockets of emptiness when people leave.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But do small businesses have the time for coaching? ''If you want productivity out of someone, it's in your interest to take the time,'' Ms. Van Kirk said. ''It can be a two-minute conversation -- a side conversation as you go along -- with an occasional sit-down hour.'' Moreover, employers can often learn from the students in these sessions, she said. ''This generation is very savvy, very technical -- they've grown up with the Internet.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Van Kirk, who runs a nationwide internship program for the firm, said, ''We look at it as a crucial component.'' The company hires 1,700 to 1,800 interns a year, most of whom are between their junior and senior years at college. After orientation and training, they do the work of first-year hires supervised by a manager or partner and a peer mentor, who is a younger employee, Ms. Van Kirk said. About 85 percent get an offer to return after graduation or graduate school, and 90 percent of those accept, she said. ''It really gives them a leg up,'' she said, adding that it helped the firm as well. ''Our internship is to fill our full-time pipeline.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sullivan, an assurance partner in the firm's private company services practice in Stamford, Conn., said that hiring summer interns was ideal for small businesses. It gives students ''an exposure to the business,'' he said, so they ''learn from the ground up, not just the executive suite.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good way to find interns is through universities, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a personal reward to an employer to be a mentor,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''You feel like you make a difference in someone's life.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Interns have an opportunity to network, develop relationships and gain experience,'' Mr. Sullivan said. He got his start in accounting during college as an unpaid intern for a solo practice in upstate New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefanie Seidel, an intern who was mentored by Mr. Sullivan, returned to the firm after graduating from the State University of New York at Oneonta in 2006. ''I can recommend it to anyone in any field if they have an opportunity to do an internship,'' she said. In college you learn the technical aspects of your profession, she said, and in the internship you learn the human aspects, relating to the people at the firm and to the clients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIRE RETIREES -- A business wanting the most efficient, experienced professional available as a summer vacation replacement can often consider its own retirees, said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the New York accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin &amp; Company. Many welcome a brief return to the work force.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the ideal person is not available,'' Mr. Neumark said, ''look for anyone else in the field.'' Asking professional contacts for referrals helps to both find the best people and avoid fees that temporary-help agencies charge, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EMPLOY YOUR CHILDREN -- Family-owned businesses can realize both personal and monetary rewards by employing their children, said Sidney Kess, a New York lawyer and accountant. The money you pay them stays in the family, and there are large tax advantages. The children also get an early introduction to the business, helping both generations to decide whether the children will enter the business and one day run it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recommended keeping time records as evidence that the work was done, and said that wages cannot exceed the going rate for the work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the standard income tax deduction is $5,350 this year, a child can earn that much without owing any tax, and if she files a W4 form (available at irs.gov) saying on Line 7 that she does not expect to owe any tax, no withholding is required, Mr. Kess said. If the child puts money into an I.R.A., she could earn up to $9,350 and owe no tax.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE environment for today's entrepreneurs is far different in a number of ways from the boom of the late '90s, Steven Levy noted this week in Newsweek.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is ''dramatically cheaper to start a company now,'' he wrote, so it is substantially easier to build a business, sometimes without needing venture capital. ''Software tools, which used to cost hundreds of thousands, are now largely free,'' while computer equipment and bandwidth are much less expensive.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that is great, as long as you are not too old. ''The old wisdom for investors in start-ups said you needed an experienced hand as a C.E.O.'' Mr. Levy wrote. ''The Valley's new wisdom: don't fund anyone over 30'' (newsweek.com).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's only a slight exaggeration, concluded Nick Denton of ValleyWag. While entrepreneurs may be getting younger, the phenomenon is not really new.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Denton examined a random -- and highly unscientific -- sample of the most successful technology start-ups over the last three decades. ''Bad news for the graybeards,'' he wrote. ''The most spectacular successes are launched by founders still in their 20s'' (valleywag.com).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''peak age'' for the entrepreneurs he looked at was 26. ''Within a year of that age were Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Apple's Steve Wozniak, Yahoo's Jerry Yang, Skype's Janus Friis, Chad Hurley from YouTube, and Tom Anderson from MySpace.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So,'' he asked, is the current environment a ''cult of youth,'' or a ''rational response of venture capitalists to observed outcomes?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Denton notes, the venture capitalist Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures recently wrote on his blog, A VC, that most of the people running companies he finances are in their 30s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just one of the entrepreneurs in Union Square's portfolio is over 45, Mr. Wilson noted in a post titled ''The Midlife Entrepreneur Crisis'' (avc.blogs.com). ''And he'll probably be starting companies until he dies. It's what he does.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But,'' he added, ''the facts are pretty eye-opening. Nine of our 11 entrepreneurs are in their 30s. One is in his 20s, and one is in his 50s.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a follow-up post this week -- reacting in part to Mr. Denton and in part to some of the comments his original post generated, Mr. Wilson wrote: ''I don't totally buy that age matters. I think, as I said in my original post, that age is a mind-set.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So I don't know if youth is an advantage in the tech/start-up world, but it certainly isn't a disadvantage.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOTHING'S FOREVER -- It is a good idea to stock up on the Postal Service's new ''forever'' stamps, which can be used, well, forever. But do not buy too many, warns productdose.com. As an investment, they are a loser.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the price of first-class postage was increased this week to 41 cents, the Postal Service made forever stamps available for the same price, allowing people to stock up on them and use them for years to come, even as rates are increased.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming an average annual future rate increase of 3.3 percent, productdose concludes: ''there are smarter places to put your money.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even placing your money in a savings account is a better option.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GENDER WHEELS -- In introducing a blog entry titled ''Dude, you bought a girl car?'' Will Thompson of the Automotive Blogger felt compelled to write a long ''disclaimer.'' His aim, he wanted to make clear, was ''not to insult,'' but ''to point out that at some point after buying one of the cars on this list that you will most likely hear a comment about your car being a 'girl car' '' (automotiveblogger.net).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus cautioned, we learn that the Mazda Miata is ''really cute'' and ''the epitome of a top-down-at-the-mall girl car''; that if the Toyota Rav4 were smaller, ''you could totally picture it in a woman's closet''; that the Volkswagen New Beetle models ''just don't look right with a man behind the wheel''; and that when Volkswagen designed the Rabbit, it was as if ''they just plain gave up on any semblance of masculinity.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good thing he wrote that disclaimer. DAN MITCHELL   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1997, when she opened the first Build-A-Bear workshop in St. Louis, that founder, Maxine Clark, has been besieged with people full of do-it-yourself ideas (make your own books and decorate your shoes, to name a couple.) A few years ago, Ms. Clark herself wrote up a build-a-car business plan, but said she was too busy with bears to do much else than put it on her to-do list. The bears are now available in 300 stores worldwide.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Larry Andreini, 44, an entrepreneur from Fairfax, Va., with a background in financial services and customer loyalty programs, came calling with a concept called Ridemakerz, a make-and-outfit your own toy car business. ''He fit in with our culture,'' Ms. Clark said in an interview. ''He understood what it takes to bring a brand to reality.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She decided to collaborate with Mr. Andreini in the form of a $3 million investment and an estimated $15 million in back-office support from Build-A-Bear Workshop.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Ridemakerz store is scheduled to open Friday at an entertainment and retail complex in Myrtle Beach, S.C., followed in July by an outpost at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Through the partnership we're able to see every store performance of every Build-A-Bear,'' Mr. Andreini said. ''We have access to data that tells us the best place to open our shops.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fathers and sons make up 70 percent of his target audience. Here's what they can expect at the Ridemakerz store.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers select a chassis type (street or monster); body styles (stock or custom, a Ridemakerz brand hot rod, a Ford Mustang GT or Dodge Ram pickup, to name a few options); paint schemes; sound effects (for example, sirens or race sounds) and style of locomotion (free wheel or radio control).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 10- to 12-inch cars are assembled, there are ample customizing and accessorizing options: tire treads, grille guards, side pipes, snowboard racks and decals. Mr. Andreini estimates that a fully tricked-out vehicle will run about $75, including $25 for radio control. For the budget-minded, there's a stock tuner car for $12.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Build-A-Bear has a 25 percent stake in Ridemakerz, a figure that will go up to 30 percent by January, though the companies will remain discrete entities. ''There's tremendous potential here because there's nothing else for boys out there,'' Ms. Clark said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the do-it-yourself market ''hasn't exploded, it hasn't faded,'' said Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst and managing director of the brokerage firm Wedbush Morgan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Build-A-Bear continues to open 30 workshops a year and earns back almost all of its investment in a store in the first year,'' he said, ''and I can't think of many other businesses that can say that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he questions whether there are ''as many revenue opportunities'' with cars as plush toys. ''Hard plastic isn't as inherently profitable as cloth,'' he said, adding that ''Ridemakerz has a reasonable shot.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Silver, editor in chief of the magazine Toy Wishes, is more skeptical. ''If you want to make a plush animal, there's nowhere else to go but Build-A-Bear,'' he said. ''But there are a lot of model kits that let you make your own cars at home. Ridemakerz will be competing with them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And with a car it's how you play with it,'' Mr. Silver continued. ''It's about the set and the tracks. Ridemakerz doesn't offer that. Can they succeed? Yes. But it's a higher mountain than Build-A-Bear had to climb.''   </p>

In 2000, her 70-employee company was singled out as an entrepreneurial success by the agency, complete with a ceremony in San Francisco.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2003, when she lost a government contract to package and distribute informational CDs to military bases around the world, she didn't bother to turn to the S.B.A. for help.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not so sure about the overall competency level and the ability to follow through,'' Ms. Kain said. ''The best you can expect is a list of government agencies you can contact.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her assessment reflects a growing frustration among many small-business owners with the agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last five decades, the S.B.A. has been there to propel the likes of Federal Express,  <span class="companylink">Intel</span>, Staples and thousands of lesser-known small businesses. But advocates say recent policy changes and severe budget and staffing cuts in the last six years have left the agency unable to fulfill its mission to provide programs and services to the nation's 25 million small companies, which the agency defines as businesses with 500 or fewer workers. Since 2001, the agency's budget has been sliced nearly in half, to $464 million in the proposed 2008 budget. Staff cuts have been almost as deep, with the agency losing 31 percent of its work force.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere has the impact of these changes been felt more than in the S.B.A.'s primary loan program for small businesses, known as 7(a).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 2005 fiscal year, the agency has cut funding to the program and restored an earlier, more costly fee structure for borrowers. Now a borrower pays a minimum of $2,000 in upfront fees for the smaller loans up to $150,000, a rise from $1,000 before. For larger loans up to $700,000, the fee now is 3 percent, up from 2.5 percent before. For loans above $700,000, the fee remains unchanged at 3.5 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the higher fees, the agency says, the loans have easier credit terms and longer repayment periods than those typically available at commercial banks. But many small-business advocates say that is a moot point as many small businesses cannot even pull together the amounts to cover the fees.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. has also proposed raising the fees in its microloan program, which can be used for construction and expansion of facilities. Together these loans totaled $20 billion in 2006, according to the S.B.A.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While fees for the loans have increased, the average size of the loans under the 7(a) and microloan programs has decreased 25 percent, to $188,878 in fiscal year 2006, from $252,314 in fiscal year 2001, according to data from the S.B.A. The total number of loans has more than doubled, however.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. said that part of the reason that the average amount of the loans has dropped is because a number of banks use a process called S.B.A. Express. For it, banks use their own documents and need less interaction with the agency. The S.B.A guarantees only 50 percent of these loans instead of the 75 percent to 85 percent on larger loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased fees for the loans may have had another effect. The number of banks participating has dropped by nearly half, to 2,751 in fiscal 2006, from 5,228 in fiscal 2001, according to the National Small Business Association in Washington. The association said some of the drop may reflect bank consolidation, but fees and other changes in the 7(a) program had the biggest impact.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the higher fees, many entrepreneurs have turned to a growing credit card market aimed at small-business owners. A survey by the association found that the overwhelming majority of small businesses use credit cards for their financing instead of S.B.A or other bank loans -- meaning that the interest rate paid can be as much as 10 percentage points more than a conventional loan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The S.B.A. in many ways is hurting small business by increasing these fees,'' said Marilyn Landis, owner of Basic Business Concepts, a small company in Pittsburgh, who relies on credit cards for most of her financing. ''The decrease in the size of the loans is certainly a detriment to small companies -- it's barely enough to get a company started and certainly not enough to grow one.'' Ms. Landis is vice chairwoman of the National Small Business Association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more than the higher fees, reduced staffing levels at the agency have had a profound effect on small business, advocates say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller staffs have contributed to a loss of institutional knowledge at the S.B.A. and many people are in jobs in which they lack the necessary training, said Morris A. Little, president of B&amp;W Solutions, a human resource management firm in Oxon Hill, Md. Mr. Little is chairman of the board of the National Black Chamber of Commerce.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have people that can't even explain S.B.A. programs to you,'' Mr. Little said. ''It's frustrating, and after a while you don't even bother asking.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest area where the staff cutbacks are hurting small business is in helping gain access to $400 billion in federal contracting, Mr. Little and others said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a study by Congressional Democrats last year, small businesses lost more than $12 billion in contracts because of miscoding: the contracts went instead to giant corporations like  <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and  <span class="companylink">Google</span>, among others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staffing was cited as a main factor because the agency does not have enough people to ensure that federal agencies meet their legally mandated goal of providing 23 percent of their contracts to small businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the number of full-time S.B.A. employees has dropped 29 percent since 2001, to 2,047 from 2,863, according to the agency. The agency has 54 people who oversee federal contracting, fewer than it had in 1993 when federal contracting was half its current size. A result is that small businesses got just 19 percent of federal contracts in 2006, according to Eagle Eye, a research firm in Fairfax, Va. And that 19 percent includes large corporations coded as small businesses, the firm said, so the actual number could be smaller.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven C. Preston, who became the S.B.A. administrator last June, acknowledges that budget and staffing cuts have hurt, but he still sees the agency's loan programs and services as vital to small business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address budget shortfalls and staffing cuts, Mr. Preston asked Congress for $464 million for the 2008 fiscal year. The budget request is 5 percent higher than the approved budget for fiscal 2006. For the 2007 fiscal year, the agency operated without an approved budget, under a continuing resolution that provided the same funding as the year before.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston said the agency was committed to hiring more employees, including procurement-contracting representatives who would work with other government agencies to make sure that small businesses get their share of federal contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reach this goal , the agency recently promulgated regulations requiring small businesses to recertify their size status on long-term contracts when a contract option is exercised, when a small business is purchased by or merged with another business or at the end of the first five years of a contract.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While applauding Mr. Preston's efforts, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say they do not feel the moves are nearly enough.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The S.B.A. simply cannot do its job on this starvation diet the current administration has it on,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and chairman of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, has also voiced her concerns about cuts to the S.B.A., saying the budget is still 31 percent less than it was in 2001. Mr. Kerry and Ms. Snowe have proposed a $97 million increase in the S.B.A.'s budget and hiring 100 more people to oversee small-business contracting.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation has been approved in the Senate, and Representative Nydia M. Velasquez, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, is pushing similar legislation in the House.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House recently passed legislation that would increase the share of federal contracts for small business from 23 percent to 25 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the legislation, though, lawmakers say that the agency will still not be on solid footing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are talking about six straight years of cuts to the agency's budget and programs,'' Ms. Velasquez said. ''This is not something you can correct overnight.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration opposes several of the Congressional efforts, despite bipartisan support.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the proposed changes, some aren't so sure that the S.B.A, can be turned around.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that the S.B.A. backs less than 10 percent of the more than $600 billion in financing of small-business loans under $1 million, they question what help small businesses actually get from the agency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From a broader public policy perspective I think it is harder to justify something like the S.B.A. today,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody's Economy.com. ''A quarter- century ago it made sense, but today it's much easier for small businesses to get credit.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veronique de Rugy, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization, calls the S.B.A. ''irrelevant,'' adding: ''There seems to be no failure of the private sector to allocate loans efficiently.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business advocates disagree.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Langer, manager of regulatory affairs at the National Federation of Independent Business, said that although few of his members use S.B.A. loans, the agency, if adequately financed, could serve as an important voice for small business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you shut down the S.B.A., you lose an organization that is the strongest advocate for small business,'' Mr. Langer said.   </p>

Precisely to whom this will occur has yet to be decided. Word along the waterfront identifies several good candidates. Larry Ellison, the billionaire software magnate behind the American entry, BMW Oracle, is a popular choice. Another is Patrizio Bertelli, the head of the Italian effort and the C.E.O. of the design house Prada, his boats's main sponsor. Then there is Ernesto Bertarelli, an elegant 41-year-old billionaire from Geneva who is the current holder of the Cup, which his team, Alinghi, wrested away from New Zealand in 2003.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One man happily exempt from this specter of sudden heartsick, however, is Xavier de Lesquen, a former French naval officer who, as the executive manager of China Team, oversees that nation's fledgling effort to win the oldest trophy in sports. Cup dreams tend to sour swiftly, with stunning, tearful finality, and it is considered bad juju to prognosticate. Even so, several outcomes are already certain. By the time you read this, China Team will have taken its lumps and been eliminated from the competition, transforming de Lesquen's role from that of participant to interested observer. China's departure will have surprised no one, not even de Lesquen. The campaign started tardily and was woefully underfunded; for every dollar that a superteam like Alinghi or BMW Oracle had to spend, China had only a dime. Lacking the wherewithal to build a team from scratch, the Chinese absorbed a French team, taking possession of most of its assets. These included an America's Cup-class racing yacht, a support staff, several French crew members and de Lesquen. Because China is home to few world-class yachtsmen -- and those who might be said to qualify were focused on the Beijing Olympics -- it took some effort to assemble the 17-man crew required to sail an America's Cup yacht. Officials of the Chinese Yachting Association fanned out across the country and plucked unsuspecting sailors from provincial teams. After congratulating the young men for having achieved their theretofore unknown dream of competing in an America's Cup, the officials hustled them off to Valencia, where they bivouacked in communal flats and communicated with their teammates, who are primarily French, via translators. ''I think our Chinese friends are a little bit homesick, yes,'' de Lesquen admitted when I visited Spain in April. ''It's a very strange thing for them.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Lesquen is fair-skinned for a sailor, with a nest of peach-colored hair and the bemused look of a man uncoupled from all expectations. This is his third go-round in the America's Cup, and he exudes a charming (and useful) Continental unflappability. During its first months in competition, China Team was comically inept: snapping spars, ripping sails and bungling the most basic racing strategy. Once, while enjoying a rare lead, the boat's bowman tumbled over the side and vanished, prompting the race announcer to cry, ''There he goes!'' Of late, though, de Lesquen's men had begun to find an awkward rhythm. ''Every day we gain a lot,'' he said. ''They are learning.'' Though he wasn't expecting any victories in the upcoming Louis Vuitton Cup, the round-robin tourney that would decide who challenges Alinghi for the Cup, de Lesquen could report to his Chinese backers that their campaign was proceeding well, all things considered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Lesquen led me on a brief tour of China Team's base, which sits at the southwest edge of Port America's Cup, the venue built by the city of Valencia for the event. Each team maintains a base, in which they work, eat, train and entertain. China's is the most humble: a latticework of iron scaffolding shrouded in plastic sheeting. Within this greenhouse are a series of stacked metal shipping containers, of the type used on ocean freighters and by international smugglers, although in this instance they serve as the team's lockers, offices and kitchen. Atop the base is an outdoor terrace with a dragon-themed bar -- an homage to the team yacht, which they call Longtze, or ''son of dragon.'' The name, the team literature says, evokes ''speed and elegance at the same time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the kindest thing that can be said of China Team's facility is that it commands a fine view of the other bases. After we had climbed to the roof, I joined de Lesquen in gazing out over the harbor. Directly across the water stood Alinghi's base. Had it not pre-dated China Team's base, the Alinghi facility would seem to exist simply to mock it. Approximately the size of a small urban mall, it contains a basketball court, cinema, bandstand, gymnasium, gift shop and multilevel hospitality area known as Club Alinghi, which is furnished in a Euro style familiar to anyone who has ever received a catalog from Design Within Reach. The base cost almost as much as China Team's entire budget.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hopes of winning the 32nd America's Cup, which begins on June 23, Ernesto Bertarelli and his Alinghi syndicate will spend an estimated $135 million. Larry Ellison and BMW Oracle will spend $175 million, much of which comes from Ellison personally. Patrizio Bertelli's Prada team, known as Luna Rossa Challenge, will spend $135 million, and Emirates Team New Zealand will spend a relatively modest $100 million. By July 7, one of these four teams will hoist the America's Cup, having expended a combined $545 million -- almost $100 million more than it costs NASA to mount a space shuttle mission.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Lesquen turned from the view. An afternoon breeze had arrived, lofting a flock of cocktail napkins toward the sea. China Team's base was not yet complete; the thin plastic walls kept peeling free, and base security remained a strand of rope clipped to a plywood desk. But de Lesquen appeared untroubled. He stood smiling on the roof in the sun. ''At the end of the day,'' de Lesquen announced, ''this is a nice place to be.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The America's Cup has always been about money, even before it was the America's Cup. Origins of the contest trace to a taunt, made in 1850 by a now forgotten English merchant, which asserted that British boats were better than American boats. The merchant, so the story goes, dared anyone to prove otherwise. When this challenge reached the ear of John Cox Stevens, a millionaire and the first commodore of the New York Yacht Club, he assembled a syndicate of peers and hired a 31-year-old boat builder named George Steers to build the swiftest yacht possible. Seeking to stoke Steers's competitive fire -- or perhaps simply out of sheer deviousness -- Stevens's syndicate shifted its economic risk onto the naval architect. Payment for the $30,000 yacht, the contract stated, was conditional upon the boat's being ''faster than every vessel brought against her,'' in the United States or in England.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undaunted, Steers fashioned a yacht unlike any seen before. At the time, design theory held that a ship should have ''a cod's head and a mackerel's tail,'' meaning that the bow should be round and blunt and the stern narrow to a point. Steers reversed these conventions. His ship -- which would be christened America -- showed first as the blade of a sword, thickened gracefully at its midpoint, then fattened to a well-balanced finish. Also, British yachts of the era were typically rigged with a multitude of small, squarish sails made from flax, a troublesome material that required continual dousing with seawater to tighten the weave. America, in contrast, sported massive, asymmetrical sails constructed of machine-woven cotton duck, which more easily caught and held the wind, supplying the boat with astounding power. When Steers's masterpiece glided into English waters, the reaction of the British fleet was, as The Times of London reported, like one that ''the appearance of a sparrowhawk in the horizon creates among a flock of woodpigeons.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On August 22, 1851, America entered the Royal Yacht Squadron's annual regatta, challenging 14 boats on a 53-mile race to circumnavigate the Isle of Wight. It was hardly a contest. Though America became entangled in its anchor chain at the start, within 90 minutes it had outdistanced the field -- at one point building a seven-and-a-half-mile lead. America crossed the finish line alone, untested, as a band played ''Yankee Doodle Dandy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost before the music faded, however, the unsentimental syndicate sold America to a British Army captain, earning a $1,750 profit. The trophy that Steers had won for them -- a homely silver ewer that would become known as the America's Cup -- was carried to New York and unveiled at a celebration in Astor House, where it was displayed among roast quail and dessert crafted in the shape of the America. No one bothered to invite George Steers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years to follow, the trophy remained mostly forgotten. The syndicate's members discussed melting it down and recasting it as medals they might wear while lounging in their club, but the scheme never developed. Eventually, the surviving members gave the trophy to the New York Yacht Club, yoked to a deceptively clever document known as the Deed of Gift, which stated that ''this Cup is donated upon the conditions that it shall be preserved as a perpetual Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign countries.'' A variety of other reasonable-sounding requirements were set forth, none of which seemed especially onerous until it dawned on the careful reader that the Deed's net effect was to rig the game in favor of whoever holds the Cup -- a wily bit of odds stacking that enabled the N.Y.Y.C. to retain the trophy for 132 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason this sport is so unfair -- and there's nothing fair about it -- is because it's a winner-take-all game,'' explained Bill Koch, a self-described nerd from Kansas who spent $68 million to win the Cup in 1992 aboard America3. ''The winner gets the Cup, gets to set the venue, gets to pick the racecourse, gets to select the umpires and gets to select the judges.'' The rules have been made slightly more fair since Koch's campaign, but he does have a point. If the Deed of Gift was bound to the Lombardi Trophy, for instance, then the Indianapolis Colts could demand that the next Super Bowl be played in 2011, at Yankee Stadium, using flag-football rules, and be officiated by members of the Manning family.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An M.I.T. grad, Koch once did the math and determined that any one challenger has only a 5 percent chance of stealing the Cup from the defender. (''It's just crazy!'' Koch shouted.) Yet despite these odds, a certain class of people will seemingly spend anything, and endure anything, in the attempt. Ted Turner, who won the Cup in 1977 aboard Courageous, described the experience as ''the closest I shall ever get to heaven.'' Sir Frank Packer, another media titan who sought the Cup -- twice, without success -- blamed his costly quest on ''alcohol and delusions of grandeur.'' Baron Marcel Bich, the inventor of the Bic pen, spent an estimated $4 million of his fortune, only to end up as the lone competitor ever to become lost during a race. (After being towed to safety, Bich punched a cameraman documenting his rescue.) The baron made three more runs at the Cup, losing ingloriously every time, but he reportedly considered his investment well spent, as it offered a nifty branding opportunity for his line of disposable pens and razors. (Such marketing tactics do have their limits. Yves Rousset-Rouard, who headed a French campaign in 1983, likely saw little benefit to his signature product, a series of soft-core motion pictures featuring an adventuresome young woman named Emmanuelle.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the rationale for competing in the Cup remains personal and even egotistical -- which, fortunately, tends to ensure the presence of oddballs in the mix. One favorite among Cup cognoscenti is William Henn, whose Galatea sailed in 1886 with a crew that included a raccoon, dogs, cats and a monkey named Peggy, who assisted in the lowering of sails and also served as team cheerleader, racing to the bowsprit and screeching and jumping with delight whenever Galatea took the lead.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one thing is missing from this America's Cup, it's the enlivening presence of a truly eccentric character like Turner or Bich or Henn. The person who comes closest is Ellison, a complex man with an intriguing irascibility. (During the lead-up to the 2003 Cup, his skipper actually booted him off the yacht.) But he's too seldom seen around Port America's Cup to truly engage the masses. A week after I departed Valencia, Ellison finally joined his team for its stretch run. Precious few locals ever got a good look at him, though. ''Larry's feet never touch the ground,'' a BMW Oracle team member explained. ''He goes right from the chase boat to the yacht and then back onto his own yacht.'' (His own yacht being the $200 million Rising Sun, which at 453 feet is too long to dock in Port America's Cup.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As reigning champion, Ernesto Bertarelli is more visible. To date, however, he has failed to exhibit any memorable quirkiness, beyond, perhaps, being married to a former Miss United Kingdom. Bertarelli is slender and fine-featured, with perfect skin and a tan deep enough to touch bone. In 1996, he took over Serono, his family's pharmaceutical firm, which had grown rich by developing the fertility drug that enabled the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby. Bertarelli steered the company into the American market, doubled its sales and then, earlier this year, sold the company to Merck for more than $13 billion. He is personable and polite. But he has never caught fire in the public imagination the way some of his flamboyant predecessors did. People magazine covered Bill Koch's rollicking chase for the Cup. Bertarelli's 2003 campaign was the subject of a case study by Babson College's William F. Glavin Center for Global Management.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You gotta be willing to spend your last penny,'' Koch told me, explaining how to make a splash. ''And you gotta be willing to put every conceivable effort in it and be willing to sacrifice everything to win. It led to my divorce, and it led to my 6-year-old son hating sailing. And it's basically a silly sailboat race, and its only importance is in the minds of the participants.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many sports subcultures -- curling comes to mind, as does biathlon -- professional yachting can seem inscrutable and slightly ridiculous to outsiders. It's a sport lacking a fan base, failing even to command the attention of the approximately one million amateur sailors in the United States. Few people wake in the morning with the thought, I need to see some sailing. When the Outdoor Life Network (now Versus) aired portions of the 2003 America's Cup preliminaries, the broadcast garnered a dismal rating of 0.1: fewer than 60,000 people. (Although, to be sure, that tiny audience is very wealthy and a desirable demographic to team sponsors and to advertisers.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before he won in 2003, Bertarelli was contemplating ways to increase the Cup's popularity. One bothersome aspect of the sport was that it vanished from the public eye for years at a time before magically reappearing, like a cloud of cicadas. Working with Larry Ellison, Bertarelli began to systematically modernize the sport, in part by remaking it in the image of other, more visible professional sports. He added 13 regattas, known as ''acts,'' to serve as a sort of four-year-long regular season. (And also to keep the yachts, which function as floating billboards, in front of the cameras.) These 13 acts lead to a playoff, called the Louis Vuitton Cup, from which a challenger emerges to duel the champion in the America's Cup. (The Louis Vuitton Cup is taking place now, and will end no later than June 12.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the N.B.A. and the N.F.L. administer all aspects of their respective sports, Bertarelli created A.C.M., America's Cup Management, to coordinate promotion of the America's Cup, strike television deals, arrange revenue sharing and oversee the venue, which, for the first time, was put out to bid. (Valencia beat out Naples and Marseille, among others, by promising to spend 500 million euros on the event.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is said that Bertarelli won his Cup -- and with it the ability to reconfigure the sport -- mainly by hiring the best match racer in the world to be his skipper. This was Russell Coutts, a lantern-jawed New Zealander who had won the trophy in 1995 (skunking Dennis Conner in the best-of-nine event) and again in 2000. Following Coutts's second victory, Bertarelli reached out to him, saying he was interested in buying one of New Zealand's yachts. The two hit it off and soon after met in a New York City hotel room, where Bertarelli offered Coutts a job. By checkout time, Coutts had agreed to skipper Alinghi, for a salary reported to be $5 million a year. New Zealanders responded to Coutts's career move by branding him a traitor, plastering anti-Coutts billboards in Auckland and issuing death threats. Coutts answered with a five-nil thrashing of his former team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the two men have since had an ugly falling out -- reportedly over control of A.C.M. -- the poaching of Coutts rearranged the economics of the sport. ''All of a sudden it became the big leagues,'' explained Peter Isler, BMW Oracle's navigator and a veteran of four campaigns. ''And not just for the Russell Coutts and Dennis Conners and those types of folks, but for the grinders, who were all of a sudden in six figures.'' America's Cup sailors now command as much as $1 million a year, a pay scale that allows wealthy campaigns to corner the market on elite talent, while handicapping poor campaigns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, such concentration of free-agent skill makes for better racing (at least in matches between wealthy teams). But it also dilutes a campaign's identity. Should they face each other in the America's Cup, BMW Oracle, the American boat, will likely have only three Americans aboard, including Ellison, and Alinghi, representing Switzerland, will probably have only one Swiss sailor -- Bertarelli. Meanwhile, more than half of the remaining crewmen on the two boats will hail from New Zealand. ''For most teams here the national image is less than the sponsor images,'' said Isler, an American. ''But I would say to all those who cry, 'Crass commercialism, nationalism is gone,' you'll be the first one on the parade when the Cup comes home.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The type of Cup fever that manifests as a parade, however, is rare. Most people simply understand too little about the sport to become infected. The teams, well aware of this dilemma, put a premium on newbie education. In Valencia, BMW Oracle maintains a sort of classroom at its base, where visitors receive instruction in boat building, match racing and the various responsibilities of the crew. (Quick lesson: imagine the team as characters in a Pixar film, with the nimble bowmen scampering the foredeck and shinnying the mast; mammoth grinders cranking the winches; and alert and clever members of the afterguard, the boat's brain trust, driving the yacht and orchestrating it all.) The atmosphere is intended to be one part Epcot and one part ESPN Zone, although the kid-pleasing experience suffers when it's time to learn more about Larry Ellison. ''As client/server computing becomes increasingly popular,'' we are told, ''Oracle rolls out Oracle Version 5 . . . one of the first RDBMSs to operate in the server mode.'' At this point the class usually abandons Larry and makes for the Alinghi base, where the educational offerings include an America's Cup arcade game and a full-scale simulator yacht that bucks and pitches and yaws.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for most spectators, Alinghi's simulator is as near as they'll get to the action. Last month, in a charity auction, a Chicago businessman paid $102,600 for the right to ride aboard the BMW Oracle yacht during an America's Cup race (if the team makes it that far). As this suggests, proximity to the sport's central drama is usually determined by the thickness of a person's wallet. For $750, fans can purchase seats on one of the spectator boats operated by A.C.M., which bounce along in the distant wake of the competitors. A private yacht ensures a better spot in the spectator flotilla, and one can be chartered for the duration or, of course, purchased outright -- although berthing fees at the Port America's Cup ''superyacht'' marina can approach a million dollars.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easiest route to a decent vantage point is to own or be employed by a sponsoring corporation, which can land you on a team's hospitality boat. One afternoon, I finagled my way aboard Alcor, the 115-foot yacht that BMW Oracle uses for entertaining, and spent an impossibly pleasant day on the water, eating tournedos of Argentine beef and drinking champagne, while the captain kept us within spitting distance of the racers. Such plums are portioned out to high-powered executives or to whatever celebrity ambles through Valencia -- Demi Moore was a recent recipient. On other teams they serve as management perks, used by a sponsor to reward star performers. After scoring an invitation to the Alinghi hospitality boat, I found myself surrounded by several dozen mid-level managers from UBS, the Swiss financial-services firm that sponsors Alinghi.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prepare the bankers for their role as America's Cup fans, Jochen Schuemann, Alinghi's sports director and one of its helmsmen, gave a seminar on match racing. Schuemann, a commanding three-time Olympic gold medalist, loomed over a small whiteboard, carefully diagramming match strategy and the tactical geometry that a skipper might employ during a race. Fifteen minutes into this tutorial, one of the bankers shot up his hand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Which is starboard again?'' he asked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Alinghi'' is a nonsense word, invented by Ernesto Bertarelli as a child. In past interviews he has said that he simply enjoyed the sound it made. Of late, he claims the word is a brand, connoting freedom, determination, partnership and cutting-edge technology. (As you might suspect, Bertarelli is a business school graduate.) Because brands require visuals, Bertarelli commissioned a logo in the form of a stylized letter ''a,'' its serif stretched into a pair of circling yachts, representing the portion of a match known as a pre-start. America's Cup racers attach an almost mystical importance to the pre-start. Often described as a boxing match, it more closely resembles a game of musical chairs with mixed-up rules: rather than sprinting to the center when the music stops, the boats break frantically for the starting line, each hoping to nab the side with the better wind.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the current champion, Alinghi did not participate in the Louis Vuitton Cup, having earned a sort of bye. Thus its last opportunity to compete one-on-one against the competition was in a series of races held in Valencia almost a year ago, known as Act 12. In one of Alinghi's last matches of this act, it happened to face New Zealand. Most veteran Cup handicappers I spoke to in Valencia believed that New Zealand would win the Louis Vuitton Cup, and thus meet Alinghi in a rematch of 2003. Should New Zealand win back the America's Cup -- and with it the Deed of Gift -- the speculation is that the team will undo the many changes made by Bertarelli over the past four years. This subtext injects a certain zing into contests between the two teams, and the Act 12 pre-start featuring the two boats was typically dramatic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Barker, a 34-year-old Tom Brady look-alike, skippers New Zealand. In 2003, Barker helmed the New Zealand boat when it lost the Cup; lately, however, he has had success, winning half of his races against Alinghi. With less than 60 seconds remaining in the pre-start, and the boats circling warily, Barker abruptly tacked, taking Alinghi by surprise. He swept behind the Swiss boat, timed the starting gun perfectly and secured the favored side of the course. Alinghi broke for the line as well. Soon the boats, as the race announcer described it, were ''stuck together like a piece of bungee.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Butterworth, an avuncular New Zealander who had been Russell Coutts's second-in-command and is now Alinghi's skipper, inched closer to Barker. (Bertarelli, by the way, is a runner/grinder on the boat -- a situation roughly analogous to Mark Cuban playing power forward for the Dallas Mavericks.) The skippers carved their way upwind, pursued by a chaotic armada of spectators. When they rounded the windward marker, New Zealand held a lead of eight seconds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In racing, the object is not to go fast, exactly, but to make your opponent go slow. One weapon skippers use to achieve this is their boat's wind shadow: the pie-shaped wedge of disturbed air that spills off a yacht. On upwind runs the leading boat uses this weapon to spoil the trailing boat's air. On downwind legs the advantage flips, and the trailing boat tries to steal the leading boat's wind. What typically follows in such situations is a tacking duel, a spectacular stretch of action in which one boat veers wildly, attempting to break free of the other. A duel can require as many as 50 tacks in a single leg, rocketing grinders' heart rates to 200 beats per minute and severely testing a crew's stamina. Boats also suffer horribly, struggling to remain intact as their massive sails fight the 20-ton keel. Yachts signal their distress with a loud array of cracks and pops, and with long, mournful moans. ''They really cry for help, these boats,'' said Christoph Erbelding, an engineer with BMW Oracle. (After a ride aboard an American boat in 2003, Robin Williams remarked that the sound was like that of ''an old man trying to have sex.'')   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Races are 14 miles, with four roughly equal legs. They last about 75 minutes. Alinghi and New Zealand clashed for almost an hour, speeding down the course, rounding and fighting their way upwind, then rounding a final time. In theory, an America's Cup race tests the skill of the crew (on the upwind legs) and the speed of the boat (on the downwind runs). But the reality is more simple, as Koch explained: ''Only fast boats win. And the team that wins is not the most brilliant, but the one that makes the fewest mistakes.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it prepares to defend the Cup, Alinghi drills six days a week, on the water and in the classroom, learning how to react to every conceivable racing situation. Team members practice a method of speaking on the boat, using specific syntax and shifts in tone to signal changes in tactic or an increased level of urgency. They codify a system of making decisions, so that if the strategist clinging to the mast 90 feet in the air spots a stain moving across the water, his message that the wind is about to shift will speed without error through the crew's nervous system and arrive at its brain. ''Nothing's taken for granted,'' Alinghi's John Russell, a boat builder, told me. ''Everything's checked off, everything's looked at, everything's investigated. It's a pretty clinical kind of a team.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the while, Alinghi's scientific advisers -- a Ph.D.-laden bunch from Geneva's renowned Acole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne -- works to replicate George Steers's feat from 146 years ago. (''It's a technology contest,'' one Cup veteran said. ''As it has been since 1851.'') The trick is to build a boat forever on the verge of breaking. ''To make it as light as possible,'' BMW Oracle's Erbelding explained, ''but as strong as possible, too.'' Teams construct their boats to suit the conditions that historically prevail at the venue. But weather is increasingly fickle and forecasting imprecise. In 2003, New Zealand staked the Cup on a boat designed to sail best in light wind and flat water. Conditions, however, turned out to be atypically harsh. During the first race, New Zealand's boat took on so much water it almost sank. In the fourth race, the mast snapped. In the fifth race, the spinnaker broke. Alinghi arrived in Auckland with a boat that happened to be better for the conditions as they existed at that fleeting moment. Because of this good fortune, Bertarelli won his Cup.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten minutes offshore of Valencia, Alinghi and New Zealand entered the final leg of their match. Barker had fought Alinghi through three-quarters of the race, and still held a boat's length advantage. Both crews struggled to find hidden speed. ''Expect kitchen sinks and all sorts to be thrown!'' the announcer said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boats had sailed far to the opposite sides of the course, hunting clear air. Now they turned toward each other, roaring at full power toward a likely collision.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last-chance leg!'' the announcer cried. ''What happens now?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bertarelli was poised at his station, calmly focusing his breath before the final charge.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here they go!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alinghi bore down on New Zealand from the starboard side, the boats almost close enough to touch, Butterworth pressuring Barker to make a move. New Zealand jibed to block, but Alinghi countered perfectly and slid smoothly past. New Zealand's crew scrambled to regain its advantage. Races hinge on the most minor of miracles -- a shift of wind, a slip of a hand. Barker's boat began to slow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crew error!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A moment later New Zealand's spinnaker spilled its air, sagging sadly from the mast. Alinghi sped across the finish line. ''That's the first time the pressure has gotten to the New Zealand team,'' the announcer said. ''Brilliant sailing by Alinghi.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The America's Cup is the only sport in which a team, if it fails to win the championship, often ceases to exist. (Imagine 31 N.F.L. teams disbanding after the Super Bowl.) Historically, only about one in 10 campaigns continues after a loss. The others vanish, their accounts emptied and syndicates dismantled. Cup historians speak of a ''curse of the America's Cup.'' Men who failed in their quest have lost their families and their fortunes. At least two have committed suicide. ''It's such a public event,'' Bill Koch explained. ''And when you lose, it breaks you.'' Larry Ellison has said, ''All these guys are not exactly having fun. This is extremely stressful stuff. It is a lot more fun to watch than it is to do.'' One team's psychologist told me, ''It's four years of their lives. And it all comes down to whether you win a race or not. That's a terrible thing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early one morning in Valencia, I went to see Bertarelli at the Alinghi base. He was seated at a low white table set with fresh strawberries and cream, orange juice and croissants. Bertarelli didn't eat anything, merely sipping his coffee while he piloted a strawberry on a plate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last time,'' he said, ''winning the Cup was a bonus. This time there is no other alternative but winning. No matter how well we would have done in regard to many other aspects of our campaign, we would still be judged a failure. It's what makes sports what it is. It's binary -- you win, you lose. Here, you win, you're on top of the world. You lose, you're nothing. You're gone. You don't exist anymore.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bertarelli's summary seemed a little dire, as did the other all-or-nothing sentiments voiced by those teams who truly expected to win the Cup. It got me wondering. A few weeks after I left Valencia, I sent an e-mail to Xavier de Lesquen, to see how he and his Chinese friends were faring. His reply arrived in the middle of the night. ''Part of the team has left,'' he wrote. ''We keep at Valencia a core team of people to operate the base and welcome the guests. Maybe some days of sailing on Longtze with guests. . . .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as I am concerned -- In Valencia until end of the AC, then jump to Brittany, my home place, to enjoy the life in my small house in front of a lonely beach with my old wooden dinghy. . . .   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kind Regards! Xavier.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven C. Preston, 46, a former executive vice president at ServiceMaster, became administrator of the Small Business Administration in July 2006. He sat down recently in his Washington office to discuss his efforts and those of Congress to overhaul the agency, which has been hit with budget and staff cuts. Following are excerpts:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. There have been some proposals in the Senate and House for reforming various programs at the agency. Do you think those are necessary?   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think it's important to acknowledge that in the absence of progress, Congress is going to feel the need to take action. So I respect the fact that many people on the Hill are working hard to think about how to improve the performance of the S.B.A. On the other side, there are policies that we're not a fan of. I am not in favor of subsidizing our loan programs. I think we should be focusing on expanding those programs by making them more effective in reaching small business. But frankly, for the amount of fee that they pay, I don't think that that's an inhibitor to our getting capital in their hands.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You've said that you felt that the agency had the budget to actually fulfill its statutory requirements. And you stand by that?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The budget we have allows us to fulfill our mission, and within that budget we are going to be a much more effective and much more efficient agency at performing what we do. So I think we're going to build capacity to perform our mission that exceeds our growth in the budget. So I think there's a great opportunity for us to be a lot better at what we do, be much more responsive to customers, improve our turnaround times, improve the quality of what we do.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are your staff levels at this point?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. With the passage of the '07 budget, we have now begun to hire a number of critical positions. We were sort of in a five-month period where we were in this continuing resolution, which means you really don't know how much money you're going to have, and so we were hesitant to begin hiring some of those jobs. But we have hired a number -- either hired or begun to post -- mission-critical jobs in the guaranteed-lending operations, much of which is in the processing center, where we need some people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. The impression in the small-business community is that people tend to like you. But they still see a lot of the programs being inefficient, or they think that the staff is not as responsive as they've been in the past, or they don't have the knowledge that they've had in the past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. When I talked about these initiatives that we're driving, the reason that we formed these initiatives in part was the fact that I've met with hundreds of small-business owners, legislators, because they hear from their constituencies, and trade associations. And what we consistently hear is we're tough to do business with, a lot of our regulations are confusing, a lot of our people aren't trained the way that they need to be. And I'd agree with all of that. The flipside is that I think we've got a couple thousand people that are incredibly dedicated, work very hard and have done excellent work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Let's talk about your impact on small businesses and supplementing the private sector. I'm seeing this number thrown out quite a bit, that the agency's program only helps about 1 percent of all small businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, you know, our resource partner network touched 1.5 million people last year. So that's 1.5 million out of 25, so that's more than 1 percent -- that's 6 percent. We made 100,000 small-business loans. I have to say, I think it's a larger percentage than that, when I just look at the sheer numbers. So I think our impact is greater.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Final question: Where would you like to see the agency at the end of the current administration?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. When I leave, if our employees don't say this is a much better place to work, I have a much greater ability to serve small business and the quantity of work I do is significantly greater than where it was, you know, two and half years ago, I will be very disappointed. That will drive the effectiveness of our operations, how well we serve small businesses, how well we're partnering with banks -- that covers everything because it all has to start with how well we're supporting our employees to be able to extend the hand of service to small business and to our partners.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially if they are brothers and business partners who are duking it out in front of their horrified employees.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ernie Doud Jr., who helped the parties eventually sort out their difference, said: ''It was the most petty conflict I can remember. They bloodied each other up pretty good.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doud, the president of Doud Hausner &amp; Associates (  www.doudhausner.net  [http://www.doudhausner.net]) in Glendale, Calif., has been counseling family firms on matters large and small for decades. He specializes in what he calls ''transitions,'' which can mean anything from persuading an autocratic patriarch to relinquish the reins to advising a third generation of owners on how to share power.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the catalyst of that fight? The 20-year-old pickup truck the brothers used to haul equipment around their California agribusiness had a broken clutch. One of them wanted to fix the clutch, the other wanted to buy a new truck.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doud traced the bad blood between the brothers to a childhood spat, and learned they had been feuding for years over everything from what crops to plant to when to irrigate them. Most important, Mr. Doud knew that the parents, basking in retirement in a faraway location, still owned the business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he hopped in his car, drove to their home, told them what was going on and asked them, ''How important is it to you to keep the farm together?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The father, Mr. Doud recalled, replied: ''We don't care. We did what we wanted to; now, they should do what they want to do.'' This was news to his two sons, who, when they heard it, split up the property. They have since become friends.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doud has a huge storehouse of anecdotes about putting out fires in family firms, and the lesson he draws from most of them is pretty much the same: Figure out what is eating the kinfolk, tell them what he has learned and let them work out a solution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Families left to their own devices often fail to have the conversations they should be having,'' he said. ''It's our job to nudge them into talking about it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listening to him got me to thinking about a larger question: the foolishness of trying to solve all your problems without outside help. Tenacity alone can't always win the day. A healthy dose of pragmatism is called for, and turning to experts in times of trouble should be the first reflex, whether it be a friend or colleague or a professional consultant like Mr. Doud. There are other options, including seeking advice at Small Business Development centers (  www.sba.gov/sbdc/  [http://www.sba.gov/sbdc/]) that the Small Business Administration operates in every state, enrolling in a crash course in entrepreneurship at a nearby university, or seeking out a specialist at a national network of volunteer business counselors known as Score (  www.score.org  [http://www.score.org]).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joey Tamer, president of S.O.S. Inc. in Marina del Rey, Calif. (  www.joeytamer.com  [http://www.joeytamer.com]), said one path to wisdom for fledgling entrepreneurs would be to offer their services to a start-up company for stock instead of salary. That way, they can get a crash course in crisis management.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in her consulting career, Ms. Tamer said, she helped inventors, curators and artists build businesses from scratch to the point where they could quit their day jobs. Without her intervention, she believes, many would have floundered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My secret: I was a realist,'' she said. ''Most entrepreneurs are dreamers. But dreaming doesn't pay the rent. I'd say: You have to do these eight things. I'd know when they should turn down a contract. I also gauged their personalities; I could tell whether somebody did or didn't have the discipline and perseverance to follow a project through to the end.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big challenge at many family firms is maintaining the peace. Mr. Doud says a grievance can fester for years or even decades until the right words bring it out into the open and pave the way to a resolution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recounted the story of a family business that owned a huge expanse of property in California, whose patriarch had put one of his sons in charge. Under his stewardship, the firm lost money year after year, exasperating his siblings and their adult children, or nearly 30 heirs in all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Invited to the annual family retreat to help get to the root of the predicament, Mr. Doud interviewed the clan one by one. He heard a great deal of carping about the chosen son's supposed incompetence, but paradoxically, also got the message that the family didn't want him to rock the boat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His very presence, however, forced a showdown. The manager, aware of what was going on around him, stood up at one point during the retreat and revealed a long suppressed secret. ''I know you all think I'm a lousy manager, and you're probably right,'' he said, according to Mr. Doud. ''I'd have to be dead to miss the signals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I want you to know that, 25 years ago, I was a young naval officer with a wife and a new baby and I was doing exactly what I wanted to be doing. Then one day, I got a call from Pop. He said, 'I need you at the ranch.' I resigned my naval commission, and I have been here ever since. But the first time I was ever able to make my own decision was last December, on the day that Pop died.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an instant, Mr. Doud said: ''All the tension in the room crumbled into dust. Everybody rushed over to him and surrounded him, giving him their sympathy and support. It was because he spoke the truth.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PORTLAND, Ore. -- There is a growing cluster of companies in the Northwest looking to capitalize on educational needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learning.com makes computer software programs that help elementary school students learn science, math, languages and social studies. ''We help teachers by integrating our program with the school's curricula,'' said William J. Kelly, founder and chief executive of the company, based here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vernier Software and Technology, based in Beaverton, makes a device that allows instant data analysis and graph-making. ''So students can concentrate on the experiment and not spend all period making a graph,'' said David Vernier, a one-time physics teacher who founded the company with his wife, Christine, also a teacher, in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saltire Software makes a program that expresses geometric diagrams and mathematical equations interactively so that students can work efficiently on scientific calculators in solving problems. Saltire is also in Beaverton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those three companies along with 27 others are members of the Northwest Education Cluster, a four-year-old organization in the Portland area that holds quarterly meetings at which these entrepreneurial companies can share ideas on directing sales efforts to school districts and teachers' conventions, or on the intricacies of staffing, finances and other routines of managing a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Cluster members are relatively small. Vernier Software has $30 million in revenue and 75 employees; Learning.com has under $20 million in revenue and 50 employees; and Saltire has $1 million in revenue and nine employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saltire, which often works on grants from the National Science Foundation, wants to expand use of its geometry program in high schools across the nation. ''That's where the big market for scientific calculators is today,'' said Philip Todd, Saltire's founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cluster originated as an idea of Fred Phillips, a professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute, a research university, and was promoted by Kelvin Ng, an investment banker in Portland. Their vision was that a cluster would expand the capabilities and horizons of small companies. The idea evidently encouraged Portland cluster members, whose ambitions to improve American education belie their small corporate size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We provide the innovations for the education field, the way biotechnology companies provide innovations for the pharmaceutical industry,'' Mr. Kelly of Learning.com said. He started up and sold a company in health care before moving to education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A revolution is needed in education -- students exist in a world where technology is pervasive but classroom teaching hasn't basically changed in 50 years,'' said Mona Westhaver, a founder of Inspiration Software, a Portland area firm that developed a visual learning system for kindergarten through 12th grade. Ms. Westhaver, a founder of the Northwest Cluster, said that new approaches sought by Portland entrepreneurs include lifelong learning, online network teaching and ''an end to the long summer break that was introduced for an agricultural society.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small companies are encouraged in their hope for change by the fact that large corporations are expanding. Pearson of London, for example, has nearly $6 billion in annual revenue from ventures in education. It recently paid nearly $500 million to acquire <span class="companylink">eCollege</span>, a United States company that supplies distance learning programs to commercial colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowledge Universe, an education holding company that has 14,000 employees and almost $2 billion in annual revenue, is raising $1 billion in private equity financing for expansion. One of its holdings is the Portland-based Knowledge Learning, which owns Kinder Care child centers and KC Distance Learning, which provides online curricula for high schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is growing confidence that reform is coming,'' Mr. Kelly of Learning.com said. His and other companies are profitable and have been growing over the last four years, he said, because the No Child Left Behind Act. That law, enacted in 2001, increased accountability of state and school districts for the performance of primary and secondary school, which ''puts accountability on school principals,'' he said, ''and they want help from technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the education technology industry around Portland faces challenges both fundamental and financial. Most serious is skepticism about the value of education technology. The Education Department reported to Congress in March the results of a major study, ''Effectiveness of Reading and Mathematics Software Products.'' The conclusion was that ''on average, after one year, products did not increase or decrease test score by amounts that were statistically different from zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelly countered that the study examined a model of computer teaching that amounted to little more than ''entertainment products, computerized Sesame Street that only distracted children from the lesson plan the teacher was trying to follow.'' By contrast, he said, his software ''is a blended model that helps the teacher implement the lesson plan and teaches children how to use online tools effectively.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learning.com is in a joint venture with Pearson to use its products in Texas schools statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer teaching aids allow individual students to learn at their own pace, said James Snyder, who coordinates the Cluster. ''Teachers can adjust curriculum to the abilities of each child, and not have to devote more time to slow learners or faster learners,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other challenge is that for all the entrepreneurial passion among the companies of the Northwest Cluster, there are few venture capitalists buzzing around their meetings eager to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cluster meetings don't even talk about attracting financing,'' complains Deme Clainos, founder and chief executive of StudyDog.com, which has a program that teaches pre-kindergarten to second-grade children to read. Mr. Clainos is seeking new financing for the company, which has $1 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture investors have been reluctant to back education companies, Portland entrepreneurs contend, because marketing to thousands of publicly financed school districts is cumbersome and uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But reluctance is fading as investment comes into education, from federal government programs and private capital. This month, for example, an investor group that includes a division of Citicorp agreed to acquire Laureate Education, owner of Sylvan Learning Centers, for $3.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Programs from kindergarten through 12th grade ''represent a $60 billion market, so investor interest is growing,'' said Corey Greendale, a vice president specializing in education businesses for First Analysis, a Chicago-based private equity and venture firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First Analysis has a two-year investment in Learning.com, which has raised $10 million in capital over seven years. Providing a return for those investors will require Learning.com to sell to a larger firm or investment group at some point. But for the present, his investors are satisfied to ride a rising trend in education, Mr. Kelly said. ''The only instruction our investors give us is stick to our mission, which is to help teachers improve learning.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Henry Browne, a criminal defense lawyer in Seattle, was steamed. A new Web site that rates lawyers the way Zagat rates restaurants, with numbers, had assigned him a low score.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Browne filed a class-action lawsuit last month.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to shut the site down,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is called Avvo.com, and Mr. Browne's first rating on its 10-point scale was 3.7, a score in a range that the site labels ''caution.'' After he complained, the rating was changed to 5.5, or ''average.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Browne said he deserved better. As evidence, he said a magazine had called him a ''super lawyer.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was Bernie Willard Potter's initial score of 6.2, or ''good,'' that drove Mr. Browne out of his mind. Here Mr. Browne had a point. Mr. Potter, another Seattle lawyer, was in fact not likely to provide effective representation, on account of possessing neither a law license nor a pulse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do take offense,'' Mr. Browne said, ''when I get rated lower than a dead, disbarred lawyer.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Avvo was scrambling to respond to complaints about the site and to the lawsuit. It took many ratings off the site, though not Mr. Browne's, and on Thursday it filed a vigorous motion to dismiss the suit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea behind Avvo, short for avvocato, the Italian word for lawyer, is a sound one. Ordinary people have no good way to look for a lawyer. Faced with a life crisis -- a divorce, an injury, a criminal charge -- they rely on word-of-mouth recommendations, the Yellow Pages, billboards or subway ads.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Avvo, potential clients can search by specialty and ZIP code, and they will be presented with a list of ranked possibilities. Nothing wrong with that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Avvo has a long way to go. It does not disclose how it generates its rankings, though it says that it relies on public records. It seems clear that disciplinary reports hurt and that experience, education and specialization help.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers who are willing to give Avvo a credit card number as proof of their identity can add information to their profiles that may raise their numbers. The site says that lawyers are unlikely to lie in the profiles because they ''can lose their licenses for falsifying data.'' It asks other users to report inaccurate information and says it will lower its rankings of lawyers who are caught lying.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the suit is full of examples of curiosities and anomalies in the ratings. The dean of the Stanford Law School had a lower rating than a lawyer convicted of helping terrorists. One lawyer, the suit said, raised his rating by listing a softball award.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avvo conceded that lawyers could temporarily raise their ratings with silly prizes but said its staff manually checked awards not already in its database. Any bump for a spelling bee championship will be short-lived, Avvo said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My rating rose from 6.4 to 7.4, or ''very good,'' after I punched in a couple of degrees and a law review article, lifting me past not only the dead lawyer but also the initial rankings of Supreme Court Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, before the site stopped ranking them by number. It did not look hard to game the rankings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just because the site is a work in progress does not mean it should be suffocated in its infancy by thin-skinned lawyers. As it refines its methods and gathers more information, including critiques of lawyers by their clients, Avvo could well provide an important and valuable service.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I realize there are some lawyers out there who don't like us shining a flashlight in dark places,'' said Mark Britton, an Avvo founder who used to be general counsel of Expedia.com. ''But if you chill and censor our opinion, what does that mean for all the other sites that process information?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Britton, whose Avvo rating was 8.2 , or ''excellent,'' said Mr. Browne's number was low because the Washington State Bar Association had disciplined him. The bar's Web site confirms that, showing that Mr. Browne was admonished in 2005 over a fee dispute.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Browne said the discipline was for a trivial matter. ''One of my associates typed out a retainer agreement that I didn't even know about,'' he said, ''and the money my client paid me was a little different.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Browne said he had lost two potential clients thanks to his Avvo rating. He would not name the lost clients because, he said, ''they have not been indicted yet.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the lawsuit, Avvo surely has the better of the legal argument. For starters, Mr. Browne has not sued for libel but has used Washington State's consumer protection law. Under Mr. Browne's theory, any publication, print or digital, that presumed to offer rankings of lawyers that were open to dispute could be shut down -- in the cause of protecting consumers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal publications these days are full of lists of supposedly stellar lawyers, which are a nice way to generate advertising and good feelings but perform no particular service. Avvo's rankings at least take account of lawyers' shortcomings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for Avvo, Bruce E. H. Johnson, was rated 10, or ''superb,'' which is a little suspicious. But he was making sense in discussing the suit the other day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most ratings systems are very good at telling us who is super or who is best,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''But there are very few that tell us where there is a risk of substandard performance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The First Amendment protects statements of opinion and evaluation,'' he added. ''And ratings are presumptively matters of opinion and judgment.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Stollery apologized through the screen window of the ice cream stand she runs in Corinth, N.Y., for being in a bit of a tizzy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The wireless is down and I've been trying to fix it in between serving customers,'' she said. ''Our tenant moved and took the router with him.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, Craig, run the Mallery Street Marketplace, a two-building collection of businesses that includes a beauty salon, a gift shop and the ice cream stand called the Barn because it resides in one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stollery has lived in Corinth (population 6,000) all her life, but she carries the same expectation of a free-floating, ambient Web as the most wired city slicker. In between making batches of a signature drink -- coffee mixed with soft serve ice cream -- she is checking in on a laptop, finishing correspondence or tweaking the Web site she built for the couple's businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People probably think we are just country bumpkins -- 'What do we need the Internet for?' -- but we probably need it more than anyone,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corinth would seem to be just the kind of digitally bygone place the writer William Gibson was thinking of when he said, ''The future is already here. It's just not very evenly distributed.'' Tucked behind the first bump of the Adirondacks, it is about halfway between Saratoga Springs and Lake George, which is not to say the middle of nowhere, but it has always been its own little place, insular and isolated by choice and geography.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International Paper pulled out a few years ago, but most people hung in, making do by doing a lot of different things. Corinth has three convenience stores, no video store and no bowling alley. There is also no movie theater, but the town's perch, just above a dam on the Hudson, is plenty cinematic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My family owns a cabin up the mountain, the kind of place city dwellers come to get off the grid. But the grid keeps finding me. Apart from the Barn, there is a good wireless connection at the public library, and if you don't mind latching onto someone else's signal, just everywhere else around town.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cell towers have stretched this way from Saratoga, and Time Warner took over the franchise from Adelphia and has been aggressively marketing a package with cable television, broadband Internet and digital phone. There's a lot of talk in the gas stations and beauty parlors -- some of it on cellphones while waiting in line -- about who is scheduled to get hooked up next.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can do wonderful stuff in terms of building Web sites these days, and so people do exactly that,'' said Rebecca Fasulo, the librarian at the Corinth Free Library. ''But what that means is that dial-up is almost unusable. You have to have a good connection to use the Web the way it is now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone I talked to agreed it was a mixed blessing. Teenagers at the high school can participate in distance learning, and people who lost their jobs at the mill in the old economy can conjure a new one right where they are.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places like Corinth have never been short on ''community,'' so the addition of some pages on MySpace, Facebook, or a goofy video on YouTube is not going to knit the place together in some bold new paradigm. The picnic table outside Stewart's will still be the best place to pick up local gossip.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a broader popular culture that many have rejected by leaving big cities now rides back toward them on a big fat pipe. If you live in Corinth and are jacked in, you could watch the final episode of ''The Sopranos'' along with the rest of the country and click onto TMZ's continuing ballad of Lindsay, Paris and Britney, there for the plucking. Indigenous culture is being supplanted by one where everybody is in on the same joke.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Corinth was the kind of place where you would see the same youngster on a bicycle several times, just sort of riding lazy circles. He is still there, but he might be talking on a cellphone while he rides or on his way over to a friend's for some online Halo 2.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't go to a public event here without there being an announcement to turn off the cellphones,'' Richard B. Lucia, the town supervisor, said. ''In that sense, I guess it sort of became like everywhere else.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is worth remembering that the cable business has roots in the sticks, that it was first conceived by an appliance salesman named John Walson in a small Pennsylvania town in the late 1940s. Today, the rural hunger for digital service represents a business opportunity for a mature industry that is going to run out of customers at some point.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time Warner's digital phone service, which came to Corinth six months ago, now has 11 percent penetration. And 1,700 people in both the town and village of Corinth (don't ask) now get some type of service from the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the course of calling around, I learned that Time Warner was headed up the mountain. Up there, towering campfires made of abundant deadfall have always been the premier viewing event. But there is already fiber-optic cable going past my house and soon enough, there will be nodes for the likes of me -- Mr. Off-the-Grid -- to jack in.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that happens, we can take care of business amid the towering pines. But how will that be different from the place we drove three and a half hours to get away from?   </p>
