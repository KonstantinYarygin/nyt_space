Some have been seeking relief from their advocate in Washington, the Small Business Administration, which this week relaxed some of the lending rules that banks must follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santanu K. Baruah, known as Sandy, the agency's acting administrator since August, sat down recently in his office to talk about changes the agency is making to help small companies weather the economic downturn.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What are the changes that the agency adopted to increase capital for small businesses?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are encouraging our lending partners to make more loans available for small businesses by not restricting them to using the prime rate when pricing S.B.A.-guaranteed loans. We are now allowing them to also use Libor -- the London interbank offered rate -- which determines what lenders pay for money. The credit crisis has disrupted the normal relationship between the two rates, which has limited the number of small-business loans our lenders are willing to approve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Have you done anything else to increase liquidity for the small companies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We adopted another emergency rule to simplify assembling S.B.A.-guaranteed loans for sale on the secondary market. It allows loans to be packaged using an average interest rate instead of requiring that all loans packaged together for sale on the secondary market have the same interest rate. This will make it easier for such loans to be assembled for sale and should encourage S.B.A. lenders relying on the secondary market for funds to continue to originate loans, which helps increase the availability of capital to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Lending in your main loan programs has decreased significantly. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The overall number the S.B.A. approved in October was down roughly 68 percent versus October 2007. The dollar value decrease in the same program, 7(a), was 36 percent less than the same period last year. Economic development loans were down 45 percent in volume and 32 percent in dollars. It's hard for small businesses to obtain initial credit, and to maintain the credit they have. But it's also a difficult environment to risk taking a loan and starting a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Does the agency plan to lower fees for small-business loans, in response to complaints that they are too high?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're not proposing that now. Loan fees are a cost-of-capital issue. But it's an access-to-capital crisis we're facing. If the cost were a deterring factor, then we'd be at record loan volumes today because the interest rate has dropped for S.B.A.-backed loans in the past 18 months. That has dramatically reduced the cost of capital, far outweighing any fee we charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The S.B.A. also helps small businesses and individuals in disasters, with low-interest loans to rebuild. Lawmakers of both parties have complained that the victims of the recent Midwest floods can get loans only at a higher rate than the 4 percent maximum offered after Katrina, as well as shorter repayment periods. Why is that and what is being done?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Last year, the agency eased rules so applicants who can obtain credit elsewhere -- meaning private sector loans -- may still qualify for an S.B.A. loan, at rates and terms that are in line with the private market. Those who can't get private sector loans can get 4 percent loans for up to 30 years, although the rate fluctuates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The agency has said that at least $5 billion in federal contracts listed as going to small businesses actually wound up at large corporations. What percentage of contracting agency data does the S.B.A. review, and what steps can it take to make sure contracts are properly directed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's a sampling. The data that is out there is better than it was, but clearly more needs to be done. There are six million contracting actions yearly, so realistically we have to rely on the data provided by our federal partners. In the next couple of months, I want to get the agency on a glide path to see what we can do to improve the integrity of the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The revised rule requiring that female-owned businesses receive 5 percent of federal contracts has been criticized as falling short of its goal. How can the agency assure women they will get the percentage Congress set?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The law does not mandate set-asides, but offers them as an option. We have followed advice and guidance to make the program constitutionally consistent because set-aside programs are continually subject to legal challenge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Lending in your main loan programs has decreased significantly. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The overall number the S.B.A. approved in October was down roughly 68 percent versus October 2007. The dollar value decrease in the same program, 7(a), was 36 percent less than the same period last year. Economic development loans were down 45 percent in volume and 32 percent in dollars. It's hard for small businesses to obtain initial credit, and to maintain the credit they have. But it's also a difficult environment to risk taking a loan and starting a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Does the agency plan to lower fees for small-business loans, in response to complaints that they are too high?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're not proposing that now. Loan fees are a cost-of-capital issue. But it's an access-to-capital crisis we're facing. If the cost were a deterring factor, then we'd be at record loan volumes today because the interest rate has dropped for S.B.A.-backed loans in the past 18 months. That has dramatically reduced the cost of capital, far outweighing any fee we charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The S.B.A. also helps small businesses and individuals in disasters, with low-interest loans to rebuild. Lawmakers of both parties have complained that the victims of the recent Midwest floods can get loans only at a higher rate than the 4 percent maximum offered after Katrina, as well as shorter repayment periods. Why is that and what is being done?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Last year, the agency eased rules so applicants who can obtain credit elsewhere -- meaning private sector loans -- may still qualify for an S.B.A. loan, at rates and terms that are in line with the private market. Those who can't get private sector loans can get 4 percent loans for up to 30 years, although the rate fluctuates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The agency has said that at least $5 billion in federal contracts listed as going to small businesses actually wound up at large corporations. What percentage of contracting agency data does the S.B.A. review, and what steps can it take to make sure contracts are properly directed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's a sampling. The data that is out there is better than it was, but clearly more needs to be done. There are six million contracting actions yearly, so realistically we have to rely on the data provided by our federal partners. In the next couple of months, I want to get the agency on a glide path to see what we can do to improve the integrity of the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The revised rule requiring that female-owned businesses receive 5 percent of federal contracts has been criticized as falling short of its goal. How can the agency assure women they will get the percentage Congress set?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The law does not mandate set-asides, but offers them as an option. We have followed advice and guidance to make the program constitutionally consistent because set-aside programs are continually subject to legal challenge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These ideas could help.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEMONS INTO LEMONADE? The current challenging environment is actually an opportunity, Michael Kanazawa argues on Slackermanager.com, but only if entrepreneurs look at these hard times in the right way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obvious reaction to an economic slowdown is to tell the staff to do more with less. But that strategy, Mr. Kanazawa says, is rarely effective because when resources are substantially cut, ''people are spread too thin and can't finish any single project or task with quality and diligence.'' That, he says, ''is a root cause of poor execution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kanazawa's recommendation is to tell employees ''we need to do more on less, meaning more resources, more staffingand more focus on fewer initiatives.'' The result of this approach, he says, ''is a prioritization of the most important and high-impact initiatives and getting the new levels of resources focused for delivering results on those top priorities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHEAP BENEFITS Overtime, the office holiday party and the company's off-site gatherings at the wonderful resort on the water may be off the table for the immediate future. But there still are some inexpensive benefits you can offer you employees, writes Entrepreneur magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are three ideas the magazine suggests:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Negotiate discounts with local merchants for your employees. Hotels, restaurants and amusement parks may offer discounts on their various attractions, including lodging and food through corporate customer programs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sign up with a credit union. This is ''one of the most appreciated, but most overlooked,'' benefits. Employees will probably ''increase their savings rates especially if you offer automatic payroll deduction, have access to lower loan rates and pay lower fees -- if any -- for services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provide free, in-house, lunchtime seminars. Financial planners, lawyers and ''other professionals will often offer their speaking services at no charge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANOTHER FREEBIE Here is a list of the five employee benefits most popular with workers: medical plans, paid vacations, defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and flex time, ITBusinessEdge reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the first four can be expensive, the odds are that offering flex-time will cost you little (if anything).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TALK IS CHEAP Communicating with employees usually does not cost a small business much. So make sure you continue to do it, especially now, as Diane Domeyer writes on Allbusiness.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A common response to changing times is to limit communication, usually by cutting back on internal newsletters, canceling staff meetings and conducting closed-door strategy sessions,'' she says. ''Employees want to know where the company stands -- where they stand -- and they want to hear this from you, not the rumor mill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FREE IS GOOD Before you sign up (and pay) for a basic marketing seminar -- something like How to Win New Customers -- or a book on the best way to prepare a business plan, visit the online courses offered by the Small Business Administration. The link is: http://www.sba.gov/services/training/onlinecourses/index.html[http://www.sba.gov/services/training/onlinecourses/index.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The courses are free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST CALL One way to do more with less is to have your customers do the work for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds ridiculous on its face, but as HR.compoints out it isn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When was the last time you walked inside your bank to do a transaction? If you can't recall, you are in good company. We use ATMs. We book travel arrangements online. We even fill our own drink cups at our favorite hamburger stop.'' . To which we would add: Most of us pump our own gas, check ourselves in at the airport and sometimes even pay for and bag our own groceries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message is clear: Look for places where you can ''outsource'' to your customers the work your employees used to do.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANTWERP, Belgium -- Teetering on their bicycles or strolling amiably while chattering into cellphones in Yiddish, Dutch, French, Hebrew or English, the Orthodox Jews of this Belgian port city have set the tone of its lively diamond market for more than a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoveniersstraat, or Gardener's Street, is the backbone of the market, where four-fifths of the world's uncut diamonds are traded. It winds past the L &amp; A Jewelry Factory and the office of Brinks, the armored car company, and on to the World Diamond Center just opposite the little Sephardic synagogue. On any given day but Friday, it is sprinkled liberally with Orthodox Jewish diamond traders, many of them Hasidim.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today their livelihoods, perhaps even their way of life, are beginning to seem threatened as foreigners move in, most notably Indians, but also Lebanese, Israelis, Russians, Canadians and others. Moreover, many jobs traditionally linked to the diamond trade, like cutting and polishing the stones, have emigrated in recent years, driven away by high taxes and salaries, to Tel Aviv or to low-wage countries, particularly India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the financial crisis and the jolt to the United States are shaking the diamond trade, especially in the holiday season, when a large part of the world's retail diamonds are bought and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Roughly half of all the polished diamonds traded in Antwerp are sold to consumers in the United States,'' said Philip Claes, spokesman for the World Diamond Center, a trade promotion group. ''And half again of those are sold between Christmas and New Year's, with a little extension trailing to St. Valentine's Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we see is exports down more than 10 percent,'' he added. ''It means trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diamond miners from Russia and South Africa reported that deliveries of rough diamonds to the market were off as much as 40 percent. Dealers talk of a ripple effect: when retail sales are off, sales of polished diamonds are off even more, and of uncut diamonds even more. Last month, the center laid off 24 employees, from a staff of 320.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Jews came to Antwerp's diamond trade in the late 19th century, when they fled pogroms in Eastern Europe. Many were on their way to the United States but settled here in Antwerp, hindered from crossing the Atlantic by illness or a lack of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years they have been shielded from the storms of the diamond market by the family structure of the business, in which companies are handed down father to son or shared among brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The total assets of a diamond company are its trading assets,'' said Freddy J. Hanard, 60, a former diamond banker who is now chief executive of the Diamond Center. ''You're not talking huge investments in equipment. So knowledge of who you are dealing with is important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jewish dealers can often be seen with a large briefcase, chained to their belt, containing much of their inventory. To this day, when a diamond changes hands, the seller, regardless of his ethnic background, says in Hebrew, mazel, meaning good luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the market employs about 7,000 people and creates work indirectly for another 26,000 as insurers, bankers, security guards and drivers. But the market has lost 25,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, since the 1970s, Mr. Claes said, with the exodus of cutters and polishers to markets like Mumbai, Tel Aviv and Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the current gloom, however, Antwerp remains a vital Jewish community. ''There are only a few places today where you can see the way the Jews lived in the 17th and 18th century in Eastern Europe,'' said Julien Klener, 69, who is president of the Consistory, an umbrella organization of Jews in Belgium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, to wander today through the former Jewish districts in Polish cities like Krakow or Lodz is to encounter mainly ghosts. But the streets of Antwerp's main Jewish quarter, adjacent to the diamond market, are full of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moskowitz's butcher shop (''Since 1933'') is filled with customers, as is Kosher King across the street. In the evening, Hoffy's restaurant on Lange Kievitstraat is filled with diners, conversing animatedly in French and Dutch but mostly Yiddish, the language of the community. Antwerp remains one of the world's few centers of spoken Yiddish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ari Epstein, 33, is the son of a diamond trader, whose father emigrated from a village in Romania in the 1960s. ''It's a typical shtetl environment,'' he said, wearing the yarmulke with a business suit. ''It's live and let live. Most important is to do business together and to be honorable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, Meilech Bindinger, 30, a native of Newcastle, England, who married an Antwerp woman about 10 years ago, was asked by the rabbis of his Orthodox community to organize local social services, especially the Jewish Welfare and Health Care. He now has about 200 men and 150 women as volunteers whose main task is to visit the elderly and sick and help establish rooms in local hospitals where the Orthodox can feel comfortable with a place to pray or read and kosher meals to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the aged, he said, wearing a yarmulke under his black, broad-rimmed hat and toying with his earlocks, are ''Holocaust survivors in their twilight years, with unique requirements and sensibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vivid memories resurface. We are trying to find how to work in sensitive areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now with the mounting trouble on the diamond market, the organization faces other challenges. ''Every not-for-profit organization feels the credit crunch in a big way,'' he said, acknowledging that the organization ''is in the red.'' He added, ''It is tight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, like Mr. Epstein, said that even with charity, things will never be the same again in the Jewish diamond world. ''Buying and selling is not enough,'' he said. ''We need accountants, administrative directors, specialists for all you do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the son of a diamond trader, he grew up in the world of buying and selling. Yet he opted to study law, then went into management at the Diamond Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This comes as a shock to the diamond dealers,'' Mr. Epstein said. ''But the time of the grocery stores is over,'' he said. ''We live in a world of the supermarket.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, California's Inland Empire -- the local name for San Bernardino and Riverside Counties east of Los Angeles -- would seem an inhospitable place for starting a business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment has already reached 9.5 percent, a third higher than the national average. And 126,000 homes have been foreclosed on -- one house in nine in an area with a population of 4.3 million. Commercial construction and expansions have halted, leaving unfinished projects and vacant buildings. The forecast is that ''it will take three years, to 2011-2012, for the area's economy to come back,'' said John Husing, an economist whose company, Economics and Politics Inc., issues quarterly reports on the Inland Empire economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the area, which had one of the nation's fastest-growing economies in the last decade, has been attracting newcomers and small businesses. One of its advantages, paradoxically, is the result of its economic travails: low real estate prices for both houses and factories. But the other is the concerted support for small enterprises and start-up companies from the area's universities and nonprofit organizations -- programs that were set in place long before the current downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why energy and hope were evident at a recent gathering of small-business owners at the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship, a part of the College of Business and Public Administration at California State University, San Bernardino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the business owners was Shawn Barker, a student in the master of business administration program who started a company, Virclom Technologies Services, last October to provide tutoring in mathematics and physics to high school and college students. Mr. Barker, who holds a degree in physics from Talladega College in Alabama, records lectures by teachers, adapts them to iPods and other formats and distributes them to students. ''Our technology allows students to review the material and reinforces learning,'' said Mr. Barker, who is looking to sell the service to school districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also hopes to automate the distribution system so that students can download tutorials from servers. That improvement will cost about $100,000, he estimated, and Mr. Barker is seeking to attract financing from angel investors or grants from federal and state governments. This is a difficult time to raise capital, Mr. Barker acknowledged, but he has sent descriptions of his company's innovations to members of Congress and feels confident, he said, because ''the new administration and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan are in favor of new approaches.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Felix Zuniga, who holds a master's degree in business from California State in San Bernardino, started Armada Business Services last September to help independent truck owner-operators cope with many demands of regulation, financing, insurance and management. The Inland Empire is a major center for freight transportation. Trucks carry cargo containers 60 miles from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to rail terminals in San Bernardino County, where they are transferred to railroad cars for transport to other parts of the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these are difficult times for truck owners. International trade volumes are down in the recession even as truck owners need to meet new environmental regulations by modifying engines. At the same time, banks and other lenders are pulling back on financing for small-business owners. ''Truckers have a high failure rate, an average 14 months from going into business to failing,'' Mr. Zuniga said. But perhaps adversity can mean opportunity, he said. ''It's when times are tough that the owners especially need our help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than start-ups find opportunities in the current climate. Gem Power L.L.C. is an eight-year-old company that developed software under research contracts for the United States Navy to recharge and extend the life of batteries. ''We can double or treble the life of any battery, whether for computers or heavy machinery,'' said John James, Gem Power's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is now trying for commercial work for its battery-charging systems, marketing to police and fire departments. The commercial effort follows recommendations of a feasibility study by faculty and students at the California State Entrepreneurship Center, which also operates a computer laboratory under a Defense Department program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like similar efforts to help small business at the nearby University of California, Riverside, the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship ranges beyond academia to get involved in the business community. The center finances its $2 million annual budget independently, said Michael Stull, an associate professor of business and the director of the center, ''by selling consulting and technical assistance services to public agencies.'' And the center organizes an annual Spirit of Entrepreneurship award ceremony to encourage and publicize local innovators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One award recipient is OncoNutrition, which has developed a food supplement that helps cancer patients maintain their appetites and nutritional intake while undergoing chemotherapy. The company, based in the city of Riverside, collaborates with the departments of biology and medicine at the university there. It also benefits from the county's relatively low-cost commercial space for its laboratories, said Olof Mollstedt, the co-founder and president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current recession, the Inland Empire's inexpensive real estate is proving in some cases to be an inadvertent asset. Charlie Mello, president of American Custom Coach, for example, has moved his company into a 23,000-square-foot factory in Redlands from a smaller one in nearby Ontario. The larger plant, said Mr. Mello, will allow his company to expand its output of vans that can be fitted out as mobile units for X-rays, mammograms, dental work and blood testing and donations as well as command posts for law enforcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't tell me about a recession,'' said Mr. Mello, an engineer who moved to California from Brazil in 1988. American Custom Coach is busy filling orders for medical vans from Qatar, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the Middle East and from Angola in southwest Africa. ''I'm on my way to Angola,'' Mr. Mello said late last month. ''It is ordering 14 vans.'' He said he intended to expand his company's work force from 24 employees to as many as 40 in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Giroux Glass</span>, a Los Angeles glass contracting company, recently bought a 40,000-square-foot building in San Bernardino for $3 million. ''I couldn't construct a building for $3 million,'' said Anne-Merelie Murrel, president of Giroux. Having seized the opportunity, Ms. Murrel said she planned to move fabrication work into the building, ''which can help serve our expanding business in Las Vegas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real estate is also inexpensive compared with most of Southern California. ''Five-bedroom homes are available for $250,000 in the area,'' said Ms. Murrel, and Giroux's employees are eager to buy there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such employees will be a key to the area's recovery, said Lee Searing, president of <span class="companylink">Searing Industries</span>, a large maker of welded steel pipe in Rancho Cucamonga. ''This area was up so high for so long, it had to plateau,'' he said. ''But a skilled work force wanting to live in the Inland Empire will attract new companies and we'll recover.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 19, 2009, Monday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Entrepreneurial Edge column on Thursday, about support for small businesses in the California counties of San Bernardino and Riverside, misstated the home foreclosure rate in the area. About 126,000 homes in the counties have received notices of default, not 350,000. (An estimated 360,000 homes, or one-third of the homes in the counties, are worth less than their mortgage balances and may be in jeopardy of default.)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese government outlined on Tuesday a plan to inject state money into ailing companies in exchange for equity stakes, a move that echoes the partial nationalization of some troubled financial firms in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement, by the trade ministry, is the latest in a string of efforts by the Japanese government to aid companies -- in this case especially small and medium-size businesses -- that are struggling as demand dwindles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few weeks, profit warnings and job losses have streamed steadily from every sector of the economy. Recent statistics showed bankruptcies in Japan jumped 24 percent in December from a year earlier, and 33 listed firms were among the victims last year -- the highest tally in at least 60 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has prompted the Japanese government, like those in Europe and the United States, to consider taking stakes in ailing companies, rather than relying on the country's banks to increase lending -- something that beleaguered financial institutions have been reluctant to do since the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Japan's banks were little exposed to the mortgage-related products that forced many of their American and European counterparts into billions of write-downs, the economic downturn and last year's stock market rout have begun to wear on Japanese financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's largest brokerage firm, Nomura, reported a $3.8 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008 on Tuesday, in large part because of costs related to its acquisition of the Asian, European and Middle East operations of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's plan by the trade ministry, to be considered by the cabinet next month, reaches beyond the banking sector to other parts of the Japanese economy. It foresees the state-owned <span class="companylink">Development Bank of Japan</span> buying shares in companies that are having trouble raising money amid the lingering credit crisis. The government will guarantee the investments should the companies go bankrupt, the ministry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it did not specify what type of companies might be eligible for such help, the plan would probably be aimed mainly at the small and medium-size outfits that employ 70 percent of the country's work force and are crucial suppliers to corporate giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While shrinking domestic and international demand, compounded by a strong yen, is weighing heavily on industry leaders like <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and Toyota, it is the smaller companies that have found it hardest to obtain bank lending. Their plight has become a highly politicized issue in Japan ahead of elections later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's recession, and broad dissatisfaction with the way in which the government of Taro Aso, Japan's prime minister, is handling the crisis, has caused Mr. Aso's approval ratings to tumble below 20 percent in recent opinion polls, raising the possibility that the governing Liberal Democratic Party will lose the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highlighting the political divisions and pre-election positioning, a 4.8 trillion yen, or $53.7 billion, stimulus plan was approved by Parliament on Tuesday, but only after lengthy discussions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plan is part of a series of stimulus measures announced since last summer. They include moves by Japan's central bank to lower interest rates to near zero and to try to shore up ailing Japanese credit markets by buying commercial paper, a type of short-term corporate debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest trade ministry proposal helped send the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock market index up nearly 5 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it remained unclear, however, how the plan would be put in place, and some cautioned that it should not be used to artificially prop up ailing companies at taxpayers' expense. Others said that the measures would do little to address the fundamental collapse in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ministry said that capital would be provided only while the companies were facing difficulty in fund-raising because of market turmoil, and that those that receive help would be required to draw up plans to increase profitability.</p>

Mr. Seiwert spoke in a recent interview about the challenges facing small-business owners seeking business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before joining the bankers' association, Mr. Seiwert worked for 30 years as a commercial banker -- more than half of that with the Banc One Corporation. Among other roles, he was the chairman and chief executive of one of Banc One's separately chartered community banks, based in Wooster, Ohio. Here are excerpts from an interview:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What is your top piece of advice for small-business owners who are worried about their ability to continue financing their company in this credit environment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. You may have a great relationship with your bank, but you should always have a backup relationship. That is really critical in today's environment. You should visit a number of financial institutions and get a feel for which ones are seeking business like yours. Many banks offer small-business loans, but they don't specialize in them. And some banks only specialize in small-business loans to certain industries. So ask the bankers if they would be open to extending credit to your business, and if so, under what terms. You may find that the loan window is open for you, and you may find that it's not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How much weight do bankers give to a small-business owner's individual credit history -- or FICO score -- the credit score created by the <span class="companylink">Fair Isaac Corporation</span>, which has so much influence over what consumers pay for credit cards and home loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. For very small loans -- $10,000 to $30,000, for example -- banks automate the process. Every bank has its own credit scoring model, but FICO scores are a part of that model. If you have a FICO score below 700, you're going to have a hard time getting a small-business loan. Standards have tightened recently, so I assure you the baseline is higher than 700 now. For small-business loans in excess of that, the banker is really trying to determine the character of the borrower. Checking the past payment history with the credit bureaus is a part of that. But it's more involved. What he is asking himself is, ''If your business gets into trouble, will you work with me to repay the loan? Or are you going to look for ways to get out of paying me?'' If you flunk the character test, it's all over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Once a banker has extended a small-business loan, what are some of the red flags that he is watching for, especially in a recession like this when so many small businesses are hurting?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. As a banker, I always knew that if I didn't get the company's financial statements on time, it probably wasn't a good sign. People were always quick to give me good news. Make sure you share all the news with your banker: the good, the bad and the ugly. Bankers don't like surprises. That's not how you build trust. And don't kid yourself. That banker sees a lot of businesses in your line of work. He banks a lot of your competitors and reads the national statistics. You will get a lot of points with your banker if you demonstrate that you understand the risks of your business in this economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. If a small-business owner has an open credit line with a bank that she has not tapped out, should she be worried that the bank might slice into the unused portion of her credit line?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There are two types of credit line. If you have a contractual line of credit, the bank is obligated to maintain that. There is usually an upfront fee because, in essence, the bank is reserving those funds for you. But you may have gotten a letter from the bank giving you a guidance line of credit, and the bank is not obligated to maintain that. The key words to look for in a guidance letter are ''terms that are mutually agreeable to both parties,'' and ''subject to review from time to time.'' This is essentially a feel-good line of credit. If you got one of those letters a year or so ago, you should talk to your banker and ask him point blank if this money is there for you if you need it tomorrow. If you're not comfortable with your banker's answer, shop around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Given the severity of the credit crisis, what are some of the forthright questions that borrowers should be asking about the financial health of their bank?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Not all banks are equally affected by this credit crisis. Banks that rely mostly on local sources of funding -- like checking accounts, savings accounts and local C.D.'s -- are not as affected as banks that rely on what I call ''hot money.'' The other aspect of this is that if your bank lent to certain industries that have been hard hit, it may have to ratchet up its lending standards. Those banks that specialized in construction and development loans, for example, are really hurting today. But the important thing to understand is that there are 8,000 banks in this country, and most of them are well capitalized and open for business.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about a growing reluctance of angel investors to finance technology start-ups misstated the status of TwoSmartDogs, a company that was unable to raise money for its online hub for adult education classes. While the company's Web site is not being updated, it is still operating; it has not been shut down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Feb 05 2009 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology entrepreneurs are having a devil of a time finding angels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angel investors are the optimistic financiers who give entrepreneurs their crucial first infusion of cash to bring their ideas to life. Now, in the midst of a punishing economic downturn that is sparing few companies, these patrons are cutting back on their bets and threatening the very foundation of the technology economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike venture capitalists, angels invest small amounts of their own money -- as little as $10,000 and usually less than $1 million -- in very young companies. But like all investors, many angels suffered deep losses when the market plunged last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has left them skittish, investing in fewer technology start-ups and demanding more of those they do consider, leaving founders struggling to find money at the stage they need it most. The slowdown, entrepreneurs and investors say, could stunt the growth of new companies and have long-term effects on innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For TwoSmartDogs, an Internet start-up in Los Angeles that was building an online hub for adult education classes, this sudden pullback was disastrous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the company raised $715,000 in its first round of angel financing from eight investors. When the founders approached current and new investors for more capital in September, they were met with silence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was real interest,'' said Rose Ors, a founder of the company. ''But the economic meltdown ended all conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to raise money, Ms. Ors and her partners decided to shut down the company and look for new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The angels who rejected them are not unusual. Half of the investors surveyed in November by the Angel Capital Association, the industry's trade group, said they invested less than they had predicted in 2008, and one-third said the number of deals and dollar amounts they invest would decrease again this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crashes make liquidity vanish, and venture investing -- especially angel investing -- runs on liquidity,'' said Steven McGeady, an angel investor and former executive at Intel. ''When the markets go wonky, everyone sits on cash until the situation resolves itself. This makes capital hard to find, and if a company is caught unprepared or at the wrong time, that can be the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many professional angels -- those who invest as a full-time job, rather than as a side project -- are still financing start-ups, if at a slower pace. They say the best opportunities come during downturns, as companies' valuations fall significantly. The median valuation of start-ups seeking angel financing fell 25 percent, to $3 million, from the third to the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Angelsoft, a Web service for angel investors and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's getting tougher for companies to raise money, but I think the good ones are still getting it done,'' said Ron Conway, a prominent professional angel investor in Silicon Valley who has invested in companies including <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet unlike Mr. Conway, most angel investors are hobbyists -- wealthy friends and relatives of entrepreneurs who invest as a way to diversify their portfolios -- and they have been hit the hardest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Martin, an angel investor based in San Francisco who made millions when his family sold its aerospace contracting business in 2003, has invested several hundred thousand dollars of that in a handful of start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, though, the Martin family's stock holdings lost close to 30 percent of their value. Now the Martins are shying away from risky angel investments and looking elsewhere for returns, including in undervalued public companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in the stock market ''smells to me like a much better opportunity than investing in the friend of a friend who wants to open a green <span class="companylink">Chuck E. Cheese</span> restaurant or software to let people choose their dental implants,'' Mr. Martin said. ''Those could be great ideas. But that versus <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> stock is an easy choice for us right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During normal economic times, several years after a start-up raises angel financing, it seeks larger amounts of money from venture capitalists to grow. But as venture capitalists also cut back on investments, many angels are wary of investing in a start-up without the assurance that the company will be able to raise more money to keep growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of companies view us to be the on-ramp to the venture capital superhighway, and a number of angels are less convinced that they should count on the superhighway this year,'' said John O. Huston, chairman of the Angel Capital Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some angels are considering only low-cost companies that could become profitable without venture financing. Others are acting less like angels and more like venture capitalists, spending much more time than is typical advising companies, including taking seats on boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aydin Senkut, a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> employee who has invested in 40 companies, is serving on the board of one of his investments, ImageShack, a media hosting site, and spends two hours a week working at the start-up. ''Where I can really help is building the next growth stage,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some angels who are still investing have become pickier, making demands of start-ups that they would not have a year ago. When David Levine started Wireless Environment, which makes motion-sensor light-emitting diode bulbs, in November 2006, he quickly raised $135,000 from family members and business school friends, with few questions asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The angel investors he met with this fall, though, were far more demanding. ''I could not believe the complexity,'' he said. ''For small investments compared to their net worth, they brought in financial advisers and a whole list of questions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some made impossible requests, like proof of patents, which take several years to acquire. Others would not even meet with him. ''I think we have a very compelling business, we've hit all our milestones. I set up lunches with friends and they just keep putting them off,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, he raised $400,000 in convertible debt from JumpStart, a nonprofit organization that makes early-stage investments in companies in northeast Ohio. Because it took so long to raise money, Wireless Environment has been forced to slow its growth, focusing on its technology at the expense of inventory and sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some angel investors are putting less of their own money on the line by finding other people to invest with them. Co-investments increased in 2008, according to the Center for Venture Research, and half of those surveyed by the Angel Capital Association said they would increase co-investing with other angels this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Drew Smith retired as a venture capitalist three years ago, he has invested around $25,000 in each of four young companies, including a market research software start-up and one that makes technology to play Web videos on phones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he said, ''I'm cutting back. For me to make an individual investment on the order of $25,000, it would have to be a really great opportunity.'' Instead, he is investing smaller portions alongside other investors. ''I can reduce my bite size a little bit in terms of what goes into each investment, but still stay active.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real impact will hit Silicon Valley two or three years down the road, said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association. That is when start-ups that receive angel financing today would typically turn to venture capitalists for their first round of institutional investments, known as a Series A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we don't have angels, that hurts us. Where are we going to be gettingour next Series A deals if those entrepreneurs aren't out there with the ability to move their idea forward?''</p>

''But it's not enough to stimulate the kind of growth we need,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her company, which provides employee benefit assistance to companies with 20 to 300 employees, is reeling from its clients' mass layoffs in early January, she said. ''We still don't know how much income we lost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job creation is a hot-button topic for the stimulus package. In January, employment among businesses with fewer than 50 workers declined 175,000, the third consecutive monthly decline, according to the ADP Small Business Report released Wednesday. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees lost 430,000 jobs in the month, ADP said, indicating that the recession was hitting the sector hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like MCM Composites in <span class="companylink">Manitowoc</span>, Wis., a maker of composite molding parts for military contractors and aerospace companies as well as houseware and cookware manufacturers, have drastically reduced operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, said Michael J. Fredrich, the owner, there are only enough orders to keep operations running two- to two-and-a-half days a week. ''That's it. That's all we can do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is not included in the stimulus plan, but could help, is a reduction of the highest tax rate, Mr. Fredrich said. Many owners pay income tax at the personal level, as he does, so it would be money in their pockets to reinvest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That would have an immediate effect,'' Mr. Fredrich said, as would a payroll tax holiday, which is also not included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry McGill, who owns a commercial and industrial painting operation in Omaha, would welcome a six-month payroll tax holiday, something advocated by the National Federation of Independent Business. Mr. McGill said his remaining 30 employees -- down from 60 -- would have extra money in their pockets each week to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the amount equaled 6 percent of a payroll, and a worker made $500 a week, for example, that's $30 more. ''That doesn't sound like much,'' he said, ''but that's $1,560 a year, that's without including any overtime.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just think it's a real fair way to do things,'' Mr. McGill added. ''It wouldn't be money hidden away; it wouldn't be a lump sum. If you had 30 bucks more a week, it might be your gas for the week, but as a stimulus, it would get spent. I would certainly spend it, both at home and in my business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put it in perspective, he said, the profit margin in his industry runs 3.5 percent to 7 percent. ''You're really talking about a break that would exceed what we would consider a good year,'' Mr. McGill said. ''Boy, would that make life better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, banks are still not extending credit readily, eliminating a vital cash outlet for businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's quarterly report on bank lending, issued on Monday, found that the number of banks that tightened their lending policies on all major loan categories over the previous three months ''stayed very elevated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current climate has made owners even more pessimistic than they were last fall, according to the Small Business Research Board in Buffalo Grove, Ill., which is finishing up its latest confidence survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is needed is access to capital, said Gregg Steinberg, president of the board. Not only has lending ceased, but the value of business owners' homes is falling, meaning owners cannot tap into home equity for their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steinberg is advocating that the stimulus bill include an emergency lending vehicle similar to the disaster relief loan program after Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local banks could provide the loans with government backing and built-in technical expertise, he suggested, to ensure the program was efficient and effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul G. Merski, chief economist at the Independent Bankers Association, said that the House and Senate had tried to address inadequate lending in their bills. On the appropriation side, the House allocated $500 million to the Small Business Administration's guaranteed loan program to decrease or eliminate fees. The Senate version bumps that up to $615 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provision, coupled with a two-year increase in the guaranteed level of loans to 95 percent, from 75 percent to 85 percent, would ''kick-start'' lending, Mr. Merski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ripple effect could be far and wide, he said. Community banks, which represent about 12 percent of all bank assets, but make 20 percent of all small-business loans and about half of the loans that are less than $100,000, would churn out new loans to small businesses and franchises. Those companies in turn could buy equipment and hire back employees, who could then spend more money as consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While President Obama wants Congress to move quickly, Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, said more time should be spent examining other ideas. ''I think more than expediency,'' she said, ''it has to be a good bill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If small-business owners are to shoulder the responsibility for getting our nation back on sound economic footing,'' Ms. Kerrigan said, ''they need something from this package that will encourage them to invest, hire and prepare for growth.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH the economy in terrible shape, owners of small businesses could use a break. The tax code offers many to choose from, including some recent additions, and others may be on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses received a batch of concessions late last year, when several measures that expired in 2007 were extended to cover 2008, said Barbara Weltman, a lawyer and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes.'' These include a 20 percent credit on research expenditure and a provision that allows businesses that lease office or other space to recover the costs of improvements over 15 years instead of 39.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate break, introduced as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, was a doubling, to $250,000, of the amount of equipment and other purchases that businesses could write off immediately, instead of a bit at a time through depreciation formulas, she noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figure may go even higher. J. D. Foster, a researcher in tax and entitlement policy at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, pointed to ''a consensus in Congress to extend and expand small-business expensing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would help redress an inequity that pervades the taxation of business, he said: the fact that income is generally taxable immediately, while many costs -- the other side of the ledger -- must be deducted only over time, often a very long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more liberal expensing regimen ''seems to be something that has broad consensus politically and is certainly helpful for small businesses,'' Mr. Foster said. Just how valuable a benefit it is in a time like this, though, is debatable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't do any good if you don't have enough income to use the deduction,'' he pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weltman agreed, saying that the same applies to many other breaks. Doing even less good for small business are changes in some states that are seeking ways to shore up their depleted treasuries. She advised vigilance for ''piddling kinds of tax increases that can impact small business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One change to federal tax rules that could be useful in today's climate, especially for businesses that were on a winning streak before slamming head-on into the recession, is found in the stimulus package now snaking its way through Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provision would allow businesses that had a loss last year to offset it against profits earned as far back as five years. Businesses could immediately recoup tax paid on the profits that the 2008 loss wiped away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ordinarily when a business suffers a net operating loss, it can carry back the loss two years,'' Ms. Weltman explained. Lawmakers ''want to extend that to five years, so if you have a very big loss, you're going to be able to get a refund now. They're trying to let businesses get some money back so they can use it to survive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount that can be carried back is limited to 90 percent of the loss; the rest is forfeited. This piece of the provision is known as ''Rangel's wrinkle,'' she said, a reference to Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel that oversees budget matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deductions and accounting devices won't prevent some businesses from being unable to pay their full tax bill. As with individual taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service is willing to show businesses some leeway, a spokeswoman for the agency said. Debt collections may be postponed if matters have gone that far, and leniency may be granted when payments are missed under installment agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not they get a hand from Congress or the I.R.S., owners of small businesses can give themselves a break by structuring their affairs in a tax-efficient way. Fred Freifeld, an accountant in South Florida, tells fledgling entrepreneurs that they can reduce their liability by incorporating, but that doing so can also make tax matters more complicated, with more kinds of taxes to pay and more frequent payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners must make payments of estimated personal and, if relevant, corporate income tax, as well as self-employment tax, the equivalent of Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by employees and employers. That requires discipline and, of course, cash, which can be hard to come by when a business is new or operating in a weak economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't get behind the eight ball as far as taxes go,'' Mr. Freifeld said. ''You're not used to estimated tax payments; you're used to being an employee and having taxes withheld. Taxes have to be paid quarterly, and there are penalties if you don't. A lot of times people who start their own businesses don't think about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT is not as though business owners have nothing else to occupy their thoughts. The complexities of taxation and a concentration on other aspects of running a business may mean that new tax breaks are not as beneficial as these owners hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tax code is a pain in the neck,'' Mr. Foster said. ''My sense is that small-business people have very little time or inclination to follow the threats or opportunities developing in Washington. If there were a proposal to reduce tax rates on small businesses, it would be more eye-catching.''</p>

With the current state of the economy so bleak, those are the issues getting a lot of attention. But they are not the whole picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some entrepreneurs are actually doing well in part because times are hard. This is a story about four of them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One, Craig Brandman, founder of Medilinq, a provider of medical discounts for low-income people, predicted in a recent interview that his company would increase the number of its participants by more than sixfold this year, to 200,000 from 30,000 at the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another is Peter George, the 49-year-old chief executive and part owner of <span class="companylink">Fidelis Security Systems</span> in Boston, whose company provides protection against data breaches. Mr. George said sales rose 55 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Charles L. Burckmyer and Scott Noll, co-founders of Knob Hill Partners in Boston, are in the enviable position of sitting on about $500,000 in cash and looking for a company to buy at a favorable price in a weak market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brandman, a 60-year-old cardiologist who founded Medilinq in Houston in March 2004, described the company's target customers as the working poor and the self-employed who are both uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid. They pay $24.95 a month for steep discounts on medical bills that the company has negotiated and that, he said, ''are competitive with those offered by the Aetnas and the Cignas of the world.'' Health care providers support his product, he said, because the company makes sure most bills are paid within 10 days, in contrast to the industry average of 75 days, and because it eliminates the paperwork that can eat up 25 percent of their revenue. ''Medilinq is a sort of a <span class="companylink">Costco</span> and PayPal mode for health care,'' Dr. Brandman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the number of people without access to health care grows and as billing headaches become more acute, he added: ''We're looking at having a big year this year. Economic hard times are a good opportunity for us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. George, of <span class="companylink">Fidelis Security Systems</span>, said that in the past, companies' loss of digital assets like design documents and marketing plans was generally inadvertent, as the data slipped through holes in the computer system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a recession, he said, there is an increased chance that disgruntled or laid-off employees might purposely disseminate intellectual property to potential rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big threat to computer systems until now has been hackers from the outside,'' he said. ''Data leakage by insiders is the next big threat, and we can stop it in its tracks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelis's orders jumped 99 percent last year, he said. In 2009, ''our operating projection is to grow faster.'' Fidelis also hopes to add to its work force in the second half of this year. It doubled last year to 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics might suppose that the recession would temper Mr. George's ambitions. But he says he joined the company last March just as it was completing $22 million in venture capital financing. The timing, he said, was fortuitous -- or ''plain dumb luck.'' That nest egg should tide the company over for the next couple of years, eliminating the need to go out again with cup in hand when options for financing are limited, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partnership with International Business Machines, which markets his products, helps as well, he said. But however slow the nation's economic recovery might be, he said, he predicts substantial growth for Fidelis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 19 major data breaches in the United States in January alone, costing companies hundreds of millions of dollars, he said, and the market to protect against such breaches is expected to grow to $1.2 billion in 2011, from $500 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My ambition is to build this into a $50 million to $100 million company within three years,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll, both 32 years old and with entrepreneurial and sales backgrounds, set up Knob Hill Partners last summer and persuaded a dozen investors to provide them with a total of $500,000 in operating capital to look for promising businesses whose owners were interested in selling. They are searching especially for companies with strong growth potential and price tags of $10 million to $30 million in energy efficiency, specialty software or information technology. Once they locate a company, they said, their investors are prepared to contribute the funds for them to acquire it and manage it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices falling, the recession is a good time to be shopping for a business. But Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll say they have a competitive advantage over others who are prowling the market with the intention of re-engineering a company and flipping it after two or three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, owners who have nurtured their ventures for decades ''want to protect continuity,'' Mr. Burckmyer said. ''Their workers are like family to them.'' Unlike the bargain hunters, he said, he and Mr. Noll promise to stay in their new management roles for the long haul and to avoid layoffs if possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited inconclusive talks the two men held with the owner of an electronics equipment recycling company. ''He wanted somebody who was committed to sticking around,'' he said. ''Once people understand what we're doing, we get a better reception.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knob Hill Partners is known as a ''search fund.'' Such funds have been around for a quarter-century, but because they have consistently produced double-digit returns, they are gaining popularity with wealthy people in this recession as an alternative to stocks, bonds, real estate and other traditional investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burckmyer and Mr. Noll closed their fund in December when they got enough funds to conduct their search. Once they find a company they want -- and what their investors, who are savvy business people and their de facto consultants, also want -- they will be able to go back to their investors and get the resources to quickly seal a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody enjoys witnessing the pain that the recession is inflicting on ordinary people, Mr. Burckmyer said. Still, the troubled economy offers openings for entrepreneurs with sharp eyes and sharp elbows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're now in what I humbly concede to be an enviable position of going out to find a business to buy as pricing multiples fall through the floor,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last month, 30,000 hotel room nights booked for conferences have been canceled at an estimated loss of $20 million to the city, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those rooms were reserved for a <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> technology conference, which was moved to San Francisco this month. And the figures do not include 17,000 people who were expected to attend a State Farm agents' convention this October. That conference was canceled Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas had already seen a 4 percent drop in visitors in 2008 from the year before and a decline of 6 percent in the number of conventions and events held here in that same period. The number of visitors was down 11 percent in December from a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another conference cancellation came from the Automotive Market Research Council, which was supposed to meet at the <span class="companylink">Planet Hollywood</span> resort in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought it would be a harder sell for our members to get approval'' to go to a Las Vegas event right now, said Darren Green, vice president of the group. Mr. Green said the event had been called off as a cost-cutting measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety over the matter escalated last week after President Obama told an audience in Elkhart, Ind., that companies ''can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer's dime.'' The remark was taken by many here as an attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mayor heard the words 'Las Vegas' -- he didn't hear any other city -- and people are telling me that they're not coming to Las Vegas because the president doesn't want them to,'' said Mayor Oscar B. Goodman, who at first demanded a White House apology but later in the week said he just wanted a clarification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's an impression out there,'' Mr. Goodman said, ''that somehow if you come to Las Vegas, it's going to reflect on your business culture, and that's a bunch of hooey.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House has not commented directly on the matter. But the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said on the Senate floor Wednesday that Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, had told him that ''the president's criticism was aimed at the potential use of taxpayer funds for junkets and in no way reflects his thoughts about any one particular city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goodman and local meeting planners insist that they have heard from companies who said Mr. Obama's remarks scared them away, but Ms. Jones, the <span class="companylink">Harrah's</span> executive, said no company had made that connection while talking to her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation that has particularly rankled Las Vegas was the one by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, which received $10 billion in bailout money. The company issued a statement saying the decision was ''based on our best efforts to operate according to the requirements of the new landscape of our industry,'' but a $600,000 cancellation fee charged by the hotel has led some to question that explanation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it was a public relations move,'' Ms. Jones said. ''Why would you pay a cancellation fee and go to a city that's more expensive to get there and where the cost of food is more expensive because you don't have as many options?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no way that that ended up less money, and if the issue is really a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, doesn't that mean you look for the best value which is the lowest price?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Las Vegas on the defense, competing destinations sense an opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Theis, executive vice president of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau, said he planned to point out to meeting planners that ''people aren't going to raise their eyebrows'' about a company holding an event in his city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now more than ever, it's going to be in our favor that glitz and what's new this week in Vegas isn't going to resonate to the show managers at a time when everyone's being scrutinized,'' Mr. Theis said. ''When you take out the casinos and all the recycled chefs, what else do you really have there? Splash has a limited shelf life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jones zinged back: ''They can be licking their chops, but the minute we tell our story, they can't compete. Ever. Counting Las Vegas down and out, given the entrepreneurial spirit at work here, is just foolish.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may seem counterintuitive that in the midst of this global economic crisis a substantial number of entrepreneurs, investors and venture capital financiers are interested in starting a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that appears to be the case in Southern California. Two senior biotechnology executives are starting a pharmaceutical company, for example. In another case, a software manager is raising fresh capital to finance the expansion of a new product. A longtime Internet entrepreneur is starting a new company. And a venture capital company in Los Angeles is raising money for an 18-month-old fund to invest in small private companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody denies that obtaining financing is difficult these days, but more than 250 people showed up at a Caltech/MIT Enterprise Forum in January to hear experts offer what was described as ''Critical Insights on Building a Successful Venture in Challenging Times.'' The forum was established about 25 years ago, to encourage technology ventures in Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the Los Angeles Venture Association expects more than 1,000 people to attend its investment forum on ''Growing Companies in an Economic Downturn,'' which it is holding in Anaheim with the Harvard Business School Alumni Association of Orange County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help finance their start-up, Cure Pharmaceutical L.L.C., two former executives at <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> are putting in their own money while they seek grants from foundations. Their plan is to help develop drugs to combat diseases in developing countries, including H.I.V. and AIDS, hepatitis C and malaria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up is another step in a personal quest by Edward E. Bjurstrom, Cure's co-founder and president. He said he left his job as vice president of <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> for worldwide manufacturing in 2005 because ''I wanted to do something meaningful to address the needs of developing countries'' for access to advanced medicines. Mr. Bjurstrom said he first started a charitable foundation, CareNow, and then founded Cure with Edward G. Maliski, a research and development executive who had left <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> in a corporate restructuring in 2007. ''The financial package offered by <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> made Cure possible,'' Mr. Maliski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new company relies on compounds developed by Dr. Mladen Trkovnik of Zagreb, Croatia, that Cure Pharmaceutical licensed in September. ''Our purpose is to bring them into broader development and testing in developing countries,'' Mr. Bjurstrom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the new company has a pledge of financing for work on H.I.V.-related medicines from the Joshua W. Lavender Foundation, which brought Dr. Trkovnik's work to Mr. Bjurstrom's attention. Cure Pharmaceutical has also applied for a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for its work on drugs to combat hepatitis C. The company is also pursuing drugs to combat malaria in children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bjurstrom estimates that Cure will need $3 million over the next two years to develop and test drugs in developing countries. The company is hoping to have about a dozen full-time employees, said Mr. Maliski, the chief operating officer, along with contract workers. ''A tremendous amount of underutilized talent is available to work on contract,'' Mr. Maliski said. ''And laboratory space is abundant to be rented out on contract.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Bjurstrom said, full Food and Drug Administration trials in the United States will require finances of more than $10 million. For that, Cure will seek a partnership with a large pharmaceutical company or sell out to one, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second company that is trying to take advantage of the weak economy is Big Stage Entertainment, a two-year-old company that produces three-dimensional software allowing users to integrate their own images, or avatars, into movie scenes, television shows, video games and social networks. Phil Ressler, the company's new president, has just raised $3 million from backers. The company had already received almost $8 million in venture financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Stage's technology grew out of government-sponsored research into facial recognition software at the University of Southern California, which licensed it to Big Stage for commercial development. ''We launched the product in September and took in $60,000 in the fourth quarter,'' said Mr. Ressler, who became chief executive in July. Initial customers have been using the technology for online business promotions and video conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was raising the additional capital from <span class="companylink">Mission Ventures</span>, Tech Coast Angels investors and others, he said, ''because in bad times you have to move forward; you can't save your way to success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ressler says he is hoping that Big Stage takes in $2.9 million in 2009 and hits subsequent revenue targets in 2010 and beyond. If the business fails to meet his targets, he said, he will advise backers to sell the company. ''But I want to sell a business that is still writing orders, not one that's stalled out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jake Winebaum said he was starting an Internet company but could not discuss specifics yet. Mr. Winebaum was one of the organizers of eCompanies.com, an incubator for start-ups in the dot-com boom of 2000. When the boom collapsed, Mr. Winebaum led Business.com through lean years and successful ones as an online marketplace for referrals to business services and products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From the start, even when things looked bad in 2001, I had entrepreneurs logging on, asking us to find this kind of insurance company or that kind of manufacturing part,'' Mr. Winebaum said. He said he sold Business.com in July 2007 for $345 million to the <span class="companylink">R. H. Donnelley Corporation</span>, the publisher of Yellow Pages directories, and left that company in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he is planning a new company. ''The Internet will continue to develop at the center of all media and business over the next two years,'' Mr. Winebaum said in an interview. ''So the time to start a company is now, when there is less competition because few people are starting businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''I can put up some of my own money and raise capital from other investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank R. Kline, managing partner of <span class="companylink">Kline Hawkes &amp; Company</span>, a venture capital firm in Los Angeles, has a similar conviction that now is a time to start something. Kline Hawkes, which has invested $300 million in 44 companies in the last 15 years, sold one its investments, Cyalume Light Technologies, to a special-purpose acquisition corporation last year for $120 million, Mr. Kline said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he expected more sales of small companies. So Kline Hawkes is raising money for KH Growth Equity, a relatively new fund that aims to invest up to $15 million to help small companies expand in the expectation that there will come a time to sell the businesses. ''There will be change of control, owners will be selling out, moving on,'' Mr. Kline said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Practically Speaking column on Friday, about benefits for small businesses in the federal stimulus package, described incorrectly a provision that gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on capital investments. That provision was extended to investments made in 2009; it is not just for investments made in 2008. The article also misstated the production schedule of MCM Composites, whose president commented on the legislation. Wednesday was its last production day of the week, not the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Feb 21 2009 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE $787 billion recovery package that President Obama signed into law on Tuesday has a little something for most small-business owners, though some complained that the law's benefits were not easy to figure out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who has time to read it?'' said Michael J. Fredrich, president of MCM Composites, a maker of highly engineered composite molding parts in <span class="companylink">Manitowoc</span>, Wis.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethan Siegel, chief executive of Orb Audio, a maker of home theater speakers and systems, said his initial impression was that ''there is nothing in here for me as a small-business owner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Siegel said that as he started to dig deeper, he found a provision that would increase loan guarantees for Small Business Administration lenders. That, he said, would make it easier for Orb, whose main office is in New York, to secure a line of credit. ''With a line of credit we can do a lot more with the same amount of capital,'' he said, ''which is exactly the purpose of the stimulus package.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other items also caught his eye, including one that offers a tax credit for businesses that hire disadvantaged workers like veterans and ''disconnected youth,'' those who are not in school or working. That credit could be a tipping point between hiring and not, he said. ''This is especially true since we build the speakers in the U.S.A., and the people with production skills can fall into these groups.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owners and their tax advisers are finding that a little detective work is needed to reap the full benefits of the law, which includes tax relief for businesses and individuals, as well as spending provisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Flemming, chief executive of the Advantor Systems Corporation, a military contractor, for example, said he found spending allocated to military construction. His company, based in Orlando, Fla., makes and installs high-security systems at military installations worldwide. ''That's spending that would be stimulative for us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone will be served directly, said Leonard Steinberg, who owns Steinberg Enterprises, a tax, financial and business advisory company in West Windsor, N.J. His clients, including mom and pop retailers, limited liability companies and S corporations -- corporations that elect to have their income pass through to the shareholders -- ''won't see the benefits of the stimulus,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, tax specialists say, those companies may be aided indirectly by the tax relief for individuals, which will give workers more money to spend and will help certain taxpayers avoid the alternative minimum tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, some of the tax provisions for businesses, while they mean well, may not help in the way intended, said Barbara Weltman, a tax specialist and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She cited one provision that allows businesses to deduct up to $250,000 for capital investments. ''That sounds great,'' Ms. Weltman said, ''but you can't benefit from it unless you are profitable.'' She added that many businesses were having trouble securing financing, but, if that should free up, the incentive was there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another provision gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on capital investments made in 2008 that normally would be deducted over many years. ''Again, that only benefits those who are making capital investments,'' Ms. Weltman said. ''So many people are struggling to pay bills that they cannot go out and make purchases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One tax measure she likes is the ability of companies to use losses from 2008 to offset profits in earlier years -- any full year that is more than two but less than six years ago -- and obtain an immediate refund. It is only for 2008, she pointed out, and for companies with annual revenue of up to $15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fredrich said he had looked for a silver lining in the law but had yet to find one. ''We certainly will have a loss to carry back, but we could do that before the bill passed,'' he said. ''It does not even move the needle. If you have no revenue, nothing else matters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had hoped in vain for a reduction in the highest personal tax rate, a change that would have allowed him to put the money back into his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the bill has been signed, he said he had not had time to read all 1,000 pages, but he was not optimistic about finding help for his company, which had its last production day of the month on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weekly orders at MCM used to generate $100,000 to $180,000, Mr. Fredrich said. Last week, the company took in $32,000, and this week $19,000. ''We expect it to be worse,'' he said. ''You just have to gut it out.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said on Monday that it would try to ease a credit squeeze afflicting small businesses by buying up to $15 billion of securities that are linked to small-business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to an audience of small-business owners at the White House, President Obama said the actions would encourage lenders to make more money available to entrepreneurs and spur renewed economic growth in a vital sector of the economy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today, too many entrepreneurs can't access the capital to start, operate, or grow their business,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Too many dreams are being deferred or denied by a form letter canceling a line of credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a day when his administration was trying to head off any political damage from the news of bonuses being paid to executives of <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>, the announcement provided Mr. Obama a platform to stress that the government is helping mom-and-pop operations as well as giant financial institutions and corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's plan included provisions increasing loan guarantees for small business to 90 percent of the loan value to encourage banks and other lenders to extend credit, and waiving the Small Business Administration's loan fees and requiring banks that received federal bailout money to report each month how much small-business lending they did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama said the small-business credit squeeze was linked to the overall credit crisis, which, he said, ''began when some banks bundled and sold mortgages in complex ways to hide risk and avoid responsibility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The collapse of these mortgage-backed securities and other complex financial instruments froze the credit markets, including the markets that help small businesses access loans to cover payroll, to purchase supplies, or to expand in ways that create new jobs,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House said in a statement that the Obama administration believed that the country's ''economic recovery will be driven in large part by America's small businesses'' and noted that small companies had generated some 70 percent of net new jobs annually over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials said that by the end of March the Treasury Department would begin making direct purchases of securities backed by loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Even small businesses with good credit histories had lost the ability to borrow, administration officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiatives are intended to encourage new lending to creditworthy small companies by making loans more attractive. In addition, the administration wants to ease the secondary market for loans backed by the Small Business Administration, which has been frozen since last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a conference call with reporters, administration officials said they expected that most of the $15 billion would be used to buy newly issued securities, at prices high enough to attract sellers, but not so high that taxpayers would be overcharged. Officials played down fears that taxpayers could end up rescuing small businesses that might be better left to sink. A senior administration official said that delinquencies among small businesses would decrease when the economy turned around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the administration's small-business initiative, the I.R.S. announced Monday that small businesses with deductions exceeding their income in 2008 could use a new net operating loss tax provision to get a refund of taxes paid in prior years. The provision, enacted as part of the economic recovery plan, enables small businesses with a net operating loss in 2008 to elect to offset this loss against income earned in up to five prior years, instead of the usual two-year limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new net operating loss provisions could throw a lifeline to struggling businesses, providing them with a quick infusion of cash,'' said the I.R.S. commissioner, Doug Shulman, in a statement.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FERNDALE, Calif. -- In the verdant Eel River Valley of Northern California, where everyone is tied by blood or business, a dairy farmer named John Vevoda does his part. Though the roars of tractors have deafened an ear, and decades of nudging cows while milking have ruined a shoulder, he accepts his role and fulfills it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his family keep a herd of 600. He employs Alan, Alberto, Dave, Edgar, Jesus, Jose and Umberto. He pays his bills. He recycles. And every two days, he forwards thousands of gallons of raw milk to the Humboldt Creamery, which rises five miles away beside the twisting, rushing Eel River.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creamery looms as well over the area's economy, linking many through an understood compact: the 50 farmers who own it as part of a cooperative, including Mr. Vevoda; its 200 employees; on and on, down to those who count on its support of the annual Easter Seals telethon. Just recently the creamery began selling preferred stock so people here can own a piece of something local and organic that makes them proud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that delicate compact snapped last month when the creamery's longtime chief executive left one day and never came back, though he passed on word of possible irregularities in the books. Now the 80-year-old creamery is in jeopardy, as are the livelihoods of people like Mr. Vevoda. He joins the ranks of so many others who feel betrayed -- by the Bernard Madoffs, the American International Groups and the predatory lenders who have come to define this distrusting time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vevoda's dairy-farm view of the world makes it hard for him to accept what has happened in Humboldt County. The way he sees it, you can't just skip a milking, or stay in bed when a cow is calving. These animals count on you, and you count on these animals. The same with people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Thursday about a month ago, while Mr. Vevoda worked his farm, his herding dogs galumphing about him, the creamery's chief executive, Rich Ghilarducci, left for some business in San Francisco. He and John grew up in nearby Rio <span class="companylink">Dell</span>, and Rich was in the same class as one of John's sisters. Everyone here knows Rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late the next day, a San Francisco law firm whose specialties include white-collar criminal defense called the creamery's lawyer with cryptic news. Expect to receive Mr. Ghilarducci's resignation letter any minute now. Also, you could have problems with the creamery's financial statement, so you might want to stop selling those preferred stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief operating officer, Len Mayer, frantically kept calling Mr. Ghilarducci. Finally, he just left a message: ''Rich. Give me a clue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has not received an answer. Mr. Ghilarducci and his wife, it seems, have left their Rio <span class="companylink">Dell</span> home, a silver teapot on the stove, a classic car in the garage. A local newspaper, The Ferndale Enterprise, later found him at his second residence, in Arizona, and published a photograph of his right arm closing the door to questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central question -- what happened? -- essentially remains unanswered. Mr. Mayer would not provide a figure for the creamery's financial hole, although he acknowledged that the $400,000 raised through the sale of the preferred stock could not yet be returned to investors; it's been spent. He also said the creamery had been in touch with three federal investigative agencies in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The damage, Mr. Mayer said, ''is big enough to threaten the future of the creamery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ghilarducci's lawyer, Elliot R. Peters, declined to say why his client abruptly left his job, home, colleagues and friends. But he said that Mr. Ghilarducci had ''never done anything he thought was contrary to the interests of the Humboldt Creamery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, he said, Mr. Ghilarducci had worked hard for the creamery, and had used $200,000 of his own money -- taken from a home equity line of credit -- to cover the creamery's payroll last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mayer, though, said he was unaware of any financial rescue by Mr. Ghilarducci, beyond investments he had made along with other creamery executives. As for whether Mr. Ghilarducci has ever done anything contrary to the creamery's interests, Mr. Mayer answered in this way:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He ups and resigns without any warning? And he's not reachable?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Saturday after the resignation, while Mr. Vevoda tended to his Holsteins, unawares, creamery executives holed up at a bed-and-breakfast and pored over financial records. On the Sunday, while the Vevoda family attended church, the executives told the creamery's nine board members, all dairy farmers, what little they knew: holes in the financial records, an inability to recreate the balance sheet, and Rich in the wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 7 that Monday morning, a board member came to the Vevoda farm with a statement about to be issued by the creamery. It included phrases like independent inquiry and sudden resignation and inaccurate financial statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vevoda exploded. He ordered the man to the family kitchen, because Kris, his wife, needed to be in on this. He then called his son and partner, Robert, and said, Get your butt up here. The three Vevodas stood around the dark granite counter while the board member, who was not offered coffee, stammered that he didn't know any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John yelled, Kris cried and Robert kept asking, ''Are we getting paid?'' But after a while, what can you say?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Vevoda, 56, body aching, stared out the kitchen windows, past the hummingbird feeders, past the welcome flag waving over the herb garden, to the acres of Vevoda pasture. He thought of his 35 years as a dairyman and the many trials he had endured, none greater than this:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1987, his first wife, Margaret, and their 5-year-old son, John, drowned while swimming in the Eel River. Another son, the son now standing beside him in the kitchen, saw it happen; he was 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things went haywire after that. But through all the drinking that never rinsed away the grief, Robert Vevoda, 31, recalls that his father made him breakfast every morning, packed his lunch for school and kept the dairy going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, John Vevoda's mother, Lotta, intervened by tracking down a high school girlfriend of John's from the Bay Area. Kris was the mother of three children, divorced and working as an assistant bank manager. When her secretary said someone was asking for her by her maiden name, she hesitated about taking a call from that deep in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She took the call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he stared into the green beyond the kitchen, Mr. Vevoda did some math. The creamery owed them $120,000 for the milk they produced in January, money needed to pay bills. And they had another $380,000 invested in the dairy cooperative. All of it now at risk or gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night, John Vevoda got out of bed and threw up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next several days, forensic accountants hired by the creamery worked in Mr. Ghilarducci's office. There, under the gaze of dozens of his stuffed toy cows, they tried to make sense of the books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creamery's executives then met with the cooperative's 50 farmers in the turf building at the county fairgrounds. After a somber discussion, and with one executive near tears, the farmers voted unanimously to defer $2 million in payments for their January milk so the creamery could keep the doors open, pay employees, calm antsy vendors -- and buy time while trying to figure out how to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matters had become that precarious. ''If, say, the guy who sells us lids for our milk cartons wants to get paid immediately, everything grinds to a halt,'' Mr. Mayer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the fragile compact is broken -- when that responsibility to one another is betrayed -- the repercussions are felt by people far removed from, say, an office filled with stuffed toy cows. There are the dairy farmers, some of whose families helped establish the Humboldt Creamery cooperative in 1929. The local Easter Seals telethon, which no longer has the creamery's financial support. The creamery employees, truckers, suppliers of lids. Their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vevodas. John's mother, who lent them $10,000. Their employees. Their employees' families, including Edgar's two children, one 5 years old, the other 4 months old. The cows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their January payment short about $100,000, the Vevodas asked for time from their vendors and lenders. But the bank went ahead and processed a $20,000 mortgage payment. And one of their feed suppliers said that from now on, it's cash on delivery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vevodas faced some hard choices; after all, Kris Vevoda said, ''You can't just open the gates and tell the girls to have a nice life.'' So they held a staff meeting in the milk barn, while 24 Holsteins in the stalls waited to be milked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll be using cheaper feed, John Vevoda explained. No layoffs, for now, but you'll be working five days a week, not six. No more overtime. Oh, and please don't cash your checks until after 3 on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The men listened. A silent exchange of glances told Robert the men wouldn't leave them in the lurch. Then the morning's five hours of milking began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, those employees were back in the barn, milking the cows, while John and Kris Vevoda worked in the office and tried to keep it together. At one point the phone rang, and they decided not to pick it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon there came the disembodied voice of a former employee, now retired, offering to help with the milking of the cows. ''You don't have to pay me,'' he said. ''We're praying for ya.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Click.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The words seemed to confirm what John Vevoda had been trying to say all along about our obligation to one another, and he almost smiled.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to build an economy that is fueled by a stronger middle class,'' said Paul K. Sonn, a legal director of the National Employment Law Project. To help, his group joined with other community organizations and advocates to produce a blueprint for economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its proposed policies cover housing, manufacturing, consumer services, small business and workers' rights. Many of them have been enacted by other cities across the country. Here are some highlights from the proposals, along with information about how other local governments have handled them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CITYWIDE MINIMUM WAGE New York City has the same minimum wage as the rest of the state, $7.15 an hour, despite its higher cost of living. Other high-cost cities, including San Francisco, have enacted higher minimum wages in recent years, following Baltimore's successful adoption of a living wage ordinance in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GUARANTEED PAID SICK DAYS In 2007, San Francisco became the first city in the nation to require paid sick days for all people working within the city's boundaries, even temporary and part-time workers, with Washington following suit in 2008. About 65 percent of working poor and 45 percent of nearly poor workers do not have a single paid sick day in New York City, according to the blueprint. As a result, Mr. Sonn said, workers feel compelled to show up or risk losing a day's pay. ''It's bad for public health and spreading disease,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE GROCERY STORES Supermarkets have been declining across the city, with the shortage most severe in minority and poor neighborhoods. In Pennsylvania, a program called the Fresh Food Financing Initiative has helped finance 32 new supermarkets with 2,600 jobs in lower-income neighborhoods. In January, Gov. David A. Paterson announced a similar plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LABORERS' CENTERS An estimated 10,000 day laborers wait to be picked up each day in the five boroughs in what is a largely unregulated and shadow economy. Los Angeles, Denver and Phoenix have given public funds to day labor centers, which they say provide services and teach workers their rights. Nassau and Suffolk Counties have started taxpayer-supported centers, but efforts in other local areas have drawn fierce opposition.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAKEEVKA, Ukraine -- Few areas of Europe have taken such a body blow from the world economic crisis as the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine, home to giant enterprises in the steel and metals industry in which orders have dried up nearly completely and prices have plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Donetsk region, home to 4.6 million people, around 80 percent of the economy is tied to the metals industry. In January, when industrial production dropped by a precipitous one-third throughout Ukraine as a whole, in Donetsk it fell by half against the previous year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small wonder, then, that Sergei Yeryomin is looking for some place to vent his rage and despair. Mr. Yeryomin, his wife, Tatyana, and thousands of others lost their jobs at the giant Kirov Metallurgicals Factory in this city on Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we had a leader to lead us out on the streets, we would go,'' he said, sitting in his living room and wondering how to support his wife; his son, Anatoli, 15; and his daughter, Ekaterina, 8. ''In Makeevka, everyone was connected to the factory. If it wasn't the father, then the son worked there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the absence of a galvanizing voice rallying the workers, or a politician in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, to marshal the popular anger, Mr. Yeryomin and many others are focusing their unhappiness on the borders of this part of Europe, sliced and diced in countless wars through the centuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I look with pride at Russia,'' said Mr. Yeryomin, who lived in Russia as a child and counts himself among the 40 percent of inhabitants of the Donetsk region who are considered ethnically Russian. ''We should cut Ukraine in two, and give half to Poland and half to Russia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This part of eastern Ukraine has always felt more attached to Russia than to western Ukraine and neighboring Poland. For many here, the fraying economy is accompanied by a sense that officials in Kiev, where the government is paralyzed by political infighting, have abandoned Ukrainians to their fate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last week, more than 10,000 protesters gathered in Kiev to demand a change of government, prompting President Viktor A. Yushchenko to issue a surprise announcement that he was considering early presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether any politician can allay both the global and the homegrown troubles of the metals industry in Ukraine is unclear. For now, the national currency, the hryvnia, has lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar from its high last year, and the reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for receiving a life-giving $16.4 billion loan are the subject of endless wrangles in an argumentative Parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ilyich Metallurgical Combine, the second-largest steel producer in Ukraine, epitomizes the recent plunge back into poverty. Even by the maximalist standards of the post-Soviet metals industry here, it is huge: 50,000 employees; production facilities scattered over more than five square miles in Mariupol, some 75 miles south of Makeevka; disparate sidelines including fisheries and an airline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it is operating at only half capacity. Orders for March were anemic; those for April are trickling in. Workers have taken an average 30 percent cut in salary to avoid layoffs. Of the six furnaces in the open-hearth shop, only one is working full time. Another has been stripped for parts. Storage yards that a few months ago were stuffed with steel slabs for shipment are bare. Silence has descended over large swaths of production, close to 80 percent of which went to export.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global steel orders -- for cars, ships, construction or heavy machinery -- dropped to virtually zero last fall, analysts say. Prices for a ton of semi-finished steel dropped from around $1,000 to just $250.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not enough to cover the relatively high cost -- $360 per ton -- of producing at Ilyich's open-hearth furnace. Steel-company owners who gobbled up the state enterprises of the Communist era have not done enough to modernize, according to industry analysts in Kiev, and are now paying the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, employment rolls remain bloated -- another homegrown problem and a relic of Soviet times, when full employment was a government tenet. ''Ilyich could easily cut 20,000 to 25,000 people and keep the same output,'' said Sergiy Gayda, a steel analyst with Dragon Capital, an investment bank in Kiev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where, however, do those workers go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody wants an uncontrollable mass out on the streets,'' said Yevgeny Shendrik, deputy chairman of the regional council of trade unions in the city of Donetsk. It is a city where unemployment has officially almost doubled, to 67,500, in the past two months, and the authorities suspect that up to one-third of the 1.2 million registered workers are toiling for a small fraction of their nominal salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ukraine, statistics are as murky as prospects for the future. Some analysts argue that the recent slump has helped Ukrainian steel become competitive because of the fall of the local currency. Last year, some companies' profits were as high as 60 percent. Ilyich Steel, the main shareholder of the Ilyich metal works, in March issued a $31.3 million dividend to shareholders for 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The situation is not as bad as people say,'' said Eugene Cherviachenko, a metals and mining analyst for <span class="companylink">Concorde Capital</span>, another Kiev investment house. ''Ukraine has huge resources -- everything you need for steel production.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Makeevka, with 400,000 residents, just outside Donetsk, the Kirov factory laid off nearly all its workers in December and January. Now, an average of four people vie for every job. In nearby towns, that ratio soars to 70 or 80 people for every available job, officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yeryomin and his wife accepted severance pay of about $7,000 on Dec. 31. Since then, he has received one month's unemployment benefits, the equivalent of about $240, and found no new job despite searching daily. ''I don't know how to do anything,'' he said, ''except work with pig iron.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ENTREPRENEURIAL impulses can be stirred to life by the most unexpected influences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Donna Young's case, it was culture shock. Ms. Young grew up on the sparsely populated Andros Island in the Bahamas with 10 siblings and had long pursued a professional career. But after she married Larry Young, an architect, and moved to Epping, N.H., in 2003, she struggled to adjust to New England's taciturn ways. ''I was the only black woman in my work place,'' she said. ''A lot of the time, I felt I didn't fit in. I felt I had to be best at everything I did.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Young's entrepreneurial side surfaced not long after she arrived in the United States. She began sending her sister, Patrice Joseph, women's hats and custom jewelry to resell at a profit in Nassau, where prices are much higher. Then, Ms. Joseph moved to the island of Abaco and discovered that upscale clothing was so hard to find there that many residents flew to Nassau or even Florida to stock up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was an unexploited niche, and the two women moved in. Each invested $10,000 to start a 600-square-foot women's clothing boutique in Abaco's main town of Marsh Harbor last September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a tiny business, but it has changed Ms. Young's life. ''I feel so free now,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Young comes from an entrepreneurial family. Her grandmother ran a convenience store and bar. Her father owned two service stations on Andros and was the sole supplier of gasoline to the region. After he was shot to death in a 1994 robbery, her mother took it over. One of her brothers presides over a scrap metal operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Young sought a job with a steady income, ultimately becoming a human relations manager at the Atlantis resort on an island off the capital city of Nassau. It was there that she met Mr. Young. After their marriage, she assisted Mr. Young at his architectural firm in New Hampshire and later got a job at a utility company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she had long wanted to take the plunge into small business but did not because ''I was a single mom for several years and couldn't take the risk.'' But when she moved to the United States, she said, creating a start-up filled a void and became ''a passion for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Ms. Joseph runs the shop and Ms. Young, 44, supplies it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, she scours stores in New Hampshire and Maine for bargain designer brands. On shopping sprees that can last days, ''I try to hit all the T. J. Maxxes, Marshalls and even <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> stores within driving distance,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, she packs them, very tightly, in suitcases. ''I can get a city in a suitcase,'' she boasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, she and her husband drive to Boston and fly to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. They take the SeaEscape cruise ship to Grand Bahama Island and, the next day, board a cabin cruiser to Abaco, where her sister picks her up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is on that final sea voyage that Mr. Young sometimes stands out in the crowd. ''I'm like a shipping agent,'' he says, adding that on his wife's shopping expeditions, he is an ''advance scout'' for evaluating men's wear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Young marvels at her sales skills, a must attribute for any entrepreneur. When she is in the Abaco store, he says, ''It's incredible how she interacts with women. A lot of them walk out carrying a couple of hundred dollars' worth of clothes they probably never expected to own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just For You Boutique is currently recording sales of about $2,500 a week and is profitable. The only major misstep the sisters have made was their initial decision to aim at slim women; their best customers turned out to be women who required larger sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have resolved that problem and are putting aside most of their earnings for future expansion. Their next step is to introduce a limited selection of men's and children's apparel. And at some point, they intend to move into larger quarters and maybe open a second store on Grand Bahama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small as her enterprise is, it shows that small businesses can succeed at the outset of a recession and do so across borders even as trade barriers are going up in the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It illustrates something else, as well: the infectiousness of entrepreneurial enthusiasm. As she was making plans for the shop, Ms. Young traded ideas with her hairdresser, Bernice Jahn, a white South African transplant and her closest friend in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jahn, 48, had run several businesses in her native land and, it turned out, had entrepreneurial ambitions of her own. She often accompanied Ms. Young on her shopping tours, she said, and her friend, in turn, ''gave me ideas'' about the venture she was working on, a 2,000-square-foot spa in Greenland, N.H.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early May, Ms. Jahn expects to open the center, named Zakanaka Day Spa after the word for thankfulness in the language of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. In addition to providing hair styling and skin and nail care, she said, Zakanaka will introduce a new nonsurgical hair replacement procedure. It will also be selling African artifacts, with some of the profits going to help artists and poor children in Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of Ms. Young, she said, ''We came to this country within months of each other and we started businesses within months of each other. Donna's working with her country, and I'm working with mine. I guess you could say it's the American dream.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses will soon feel a little more love in their love-hate relationship with Yelp, the Web site whose users post reviews of restaurants, dry cleaners and other local businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting next week, Yelp will let small-business owners publicly respond to reviews. This is a big change for the site, which has until now steadfastly refused to give businesses significant access to its pages.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Business owners for years now have been asking for more and more voice on the site,'' said Geoff Donaker, Yelp's chief operating officer. ''As long as it's done in a respectable way, it's good for the consumer and good for the business owner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Yelp has become more important in major American cities, its relationship with small businesses has become more contentious. Particularly in San Francisco, where the company started in 2004, Yelp has angered some small businesses because it has not allowed them to respond to reviews, as TripAdvisor and other review sites do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yelp's co-founder and chief executive, Jeremy Stoppelman, has said that to protect the voice of the consumer, the voices of businesses, many of which advertise on the site, had to be muted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the site matures, though, it has been taking steps to appease small-business owners. A year ago, Yelp started allowing business owners to update their businesses' profile pages and privately contact reviewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest step of adding public responses shows that the start-up company is maturing, said Greg Sterling, founder of Sterling Market Intelligence, an Internet research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've received a lot of criticism about their perceived bias against businesses,'' he said. ''This is a concession to the needs and interests of small businesses who sometimes feel powerless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yelp requests that business owners use the public comments to correct inaccuracies, provide their side of a story or explain how they have fixed a problem. They are not supposed to use comments to advertise or make personal attacks. Yelp will not screen comments before they are published, but users will be able to flag inappropriate comments for review by Yelp's customer service team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Picataggio, the owner of Tart, a Los Angeles restaurant, and an advertiser on Yelp, has been frustrated by false reviews in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that although he and his staff responded privately to almost every Yelp review, he welcomed the chance to do so publicly. ''I think that's great that I get to tell my side of the story,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite billions of dollars of bailout and stimulus money, the credit squeeze that kicked off our current economic crisis shows few signs of abating. Generally speaking, banks still aren't lending, and small businesses are still struggling to find ways to finance their operations. To get a better feel for how business owners are coping, Darren Dahl recently spoke with Doug Tatum, co-founder and chairman emeritus of Tatum, an Atlanta-based consulting and executive search firm that specializes in helping growing companies with finance issues. In recent years, Mr. Tatum, the author of ''No Man's Land: What to Do When Your Company Is Too Big to Be Small and Too Small to Be Big'' (Portfolio, 2007), has spent considerable time on Capitol Hill pitching a tax-deferral plan of his design that has had the support of two United States senators, John Kerry and Olympia J. Snowe, who have long been active in small-business issues.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What's your advice for businesses looking to borrow money these days?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Quit trying. The credit markets are tougher than I've ever seen them, aside from the Carter years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.But it takes money to make money, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Entrepreneurs have a limited amount of bandwidth, and they have to quit wasting their time chasing the impossible. They need to think about how they can change their business model to become profitable. That's where the capital to grow will come from. I just spent some time with a health care consulting company that pulls in $6 million in [annual] revenue with plans to grow to $10 million. They are just bobbing, weaving and growing despite how hard it is out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why hasn't the government been able to open up the credit markets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Banks have become cautious about what they have on their balance sheets. They still don't know what their portfolios are worth. That means they're waiting for the next shoe to drop, which could be the commercial markets. I talked to the C.E.O. of a community bank who told me that they have the regulators telling them when and where they can lend money. So while you might have politicians saying, 'Lend, lend, lend,' the regulators are holding the banks back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What else should the government be doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Congress needs to be temporary, targeted and timely -- three issues in a piece of legislation I supported called the ''Bridge Act,'' which stands for Business Retained Income During Growth and Expansion. The idea is to allow entrepreneurs to defer paying up to $250,000 in income taxes so they can reinvest that money in growing their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Where does the legislation stand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Good question. Nobody seems to know. We had a lot of support four years ago. But I don't understand the politics behind it. Now that we're in a crisis, we need it more than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What would the plan cost taxpayers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Nothing. When the plan was scored when it was in committee, it showed that there would be no cost to the Treasury over 10 years. It would be a net positive to the economy. This would put $4 billion in the hands of entrepreneurs to reinvest in their companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Clearly, though, the legislation would cost the government revenue in the early years. Is that why it hasn't passed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The Bridge Act doesn't get the support it needs because too much time and effort is spent on the extremes, either on big business or on small businesses like a dry cleaner. But neither is where jobs get created. Dr. Don Walls, an economist at Harvard, has done research that shows that 50 percent of new employment in the country comes from companies with between 20 and 200 employees. Companies with fewer than 20 employees add only 12 percent of new jobs while companies with 2,500 or more employees add only 3 percent. But policy makers don't talk about that middle majority. You have all the focus on saving large corporate America, the too big to fail, or looking after the kinds of small businesses represented by the N.F.I.B. The businesses in the middle don't have lobbyists. That's why I spend so much of my time on Capitol Hill trying to raise awareness of this problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Has the Small Business Administration played a useful role in helping companies or banks through the credit crisis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Based on my interactions with companies and the capital markets, I don't see the S.B.A. as a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why do you think that is?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I don't have any data, but my instincts tell me it's because the S.B.A. lends to smaller companies like Laundromats rather than growth companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You also advocate on behalf of private equity groups, correct?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm on the board of the Association for Corporate Growth, which represents about 3,500 middle-market private equity firms. These are the firms that are providing the capital to those growing firms. But there's a misperception on Capitol Hill about them. When people think about private equity, they think of the big boys like Blackstone and K.K.R. They think that everyone is like Stephen Schwarzman and hires Rod Stewart to show up at their birthday party. The truth is there has been a sea change in the way that companies get funded. Private equity funds far more companies than the public markets these days because the cost of capital is now cheaper through private equity than through an I.P.O. And companies with between 20 and 250 employees are where all the action is. That's why it's so important for the government to be wary of any taxes or regulations that could disrupt the ability of these firms to fund growth companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you expect the economic crisis to produce other sea changes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. After the recession that came after the dot-com boom, I came across some additional research done by Dr. Walls at Harvard. He found that there was a spike in the number of start-up companies founded in that time -- more than 2.5 times the historical average. I'm betting that there will be a huge number of companies that get started over the next few years. There are far too many talented and educated people out there that don't want to watch Oprah all day. Innovation happens on the cliff's edge.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech before the Independent Community Bankers Association, Mr. Geithner said that, using proceeds of repayments that the Treasury expects to receive from some large banks, the program would reopen the application window for banks with assets under $500 million. The administration also plans to increase the maximum that could be borrowed, to 5 percent of all risk-weighted assets, from 3 percent, for institutions that qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Geithner repeated the administration's view that the financial system was beginning to heal even though ''the process of financial recovery and repair is going to take time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have already seen a substantial amount of adjustment in our financial system,'' he said. ''The more vulnerable parts of the nonbank financial system no longer exist.'' He said that there were still more changes coming, ''but a substantial part of the adjustment process is now behind us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury secretary received a warm reception from the community bankers when he said that the administration strongly supports a proposal moving through Congress that would have the effect of saving the banking industry more than $7 billion in new premium payments to prop up the rapidly dwindling federal deposit insurance fund. The fund is used to protect depositors at banks that have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A special assessment of banks has been proposed as a result of the increasing number of bank failures, but regulators say that assessment could be cut in half if Congress increases the insurance fund's credit line with the Treasury, to $100 billion from $30 billion. The legislation also makes permanent an increase in the size of accounts protected by the deposit insurance program, to $250,000 from $100,000. Administration officials and industry executives hope that Congress will complete work on the legislation as early as this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Geithner said that the administration supported a plan to give the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> broad authority to resolve major problems at large financial institutions in addition to those that offer bank accounts that are federally insured. He said such a program should be financed by special assessments on those nonbank institutions. Congress is now considering whether to grant the F.D.I.C. such authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that in the coming weeks the administration would issue a comprehensive proposal to overhaul the regulation of the financial system but he provided few specifics. He said a goal would be to eliminate the ability of companies to pick the least onerous regulator to supervise them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need a much simpler financial oversight structure,'' he said. ''It's not going to be comfortable for everybody but it's important to do.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ISRAEL has long been successful in combining government and private money to promote small-business innovation. Now, it wants to build larger companies to compete better in a global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the country's business leaders will take that message to the Israel Conference on June 4 in Los Angeles. ''We have to enhance the Israel brand by creating big, long-term companies,'' said Eran Wagner, president of North American operations for cVidya Networks, an Israeli company that helps telecommunications companies improve their efficiency. ''And not be seen as just a bunch of people with great ideas.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited three global Israeli companies as examples of what smaller companies were aspiring to: <span class="companylink">Teva Pharmaceuticals</span>; <span class="companylink">Check Point Software Technologies</span>, a provider of Internet security options; and Amdocs, which offers software and services to improve customer experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Israelis to operate on a world-company level, they must learn and apply the skills of communicating with many other kinds of people,'' said Mr. Wagner, who was born of Israeli parents in Los Angeles, but grew up in Israel and founded two companies there in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erel N. Margalit, the founder of <span class="companylink">Jerusalem Venture Partners</span>, spoke, too, about a global imperative. ''Israelis have a great tradition as storytellers, movie makers, educators,'' he said. ''We have to create new ways to bring those skills'' to video games and personal communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Margalit said his company had nurtured numerous media and information companies that were sold to large corporations in the United States and Europe or went on to be publicly listed on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. But now, he said, his ambitions go beyond Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Mr. Margalit said, his venture firm opened Animation Lab in Jerusalem, which creates animated characters and stories for films, video games and cellphone applications. The company also has offices in Santa Monica, Calif. And Jerusalem Ventures is backing half a dozen start-ups in California, including Double Fusion, which embeds ads in video games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Margalit said he was also looking to the emergence of Asia in global media and information industries. ''America is the queen of content,'' Mr. Margalit said, ''but it is still in the broadcast era, while China and Korea are in the interactive age.'' He said Israel's ''creative hub'' would focus on participation in those new markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s, Mr. Margalit, as an aide to Jerusalem's former longtime mayor, Teddy Kollek, helped bring research and development investment to Israel from I.B.M., Intel and other technology companies. Then in the 1990s, Israel's government disbursed seed money to help entrepreneurs start companies to create products and jobs. Private venture capital followed that lead and spurred the country's innovations in medical devices, bioscience and information technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Yago, director of capital studies at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica and head of the institute's center in Israel, said that ''Israeli scientists own 7,000 patents in the United States, a remarkable statistic for a country of only 7 million people'' and a gross domestic product that is only 1 percent that of the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Israel has been especially prominent in the development of arterial stents and processes in bioscience. One company, MacroCure, for example, has developed a white blood-cell therapy that spurs healing of chronic wounds, like those occurring in diabetics, in the aftermath of open-heart operations and among the bedridden and wheelchair-bound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is now entering the process of trials in the United States for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, which Mitchell Shirvan, MacroCure's chief executive, estimated would take two years. Small companies often take on partners to help pay the cost of such trials, but ''we are going to go through the trials on our own,'' said Ran Nussbaum, managing director of Pontifax, an Israeli venture capital fund that is backing MacroCure. If the company receives approval from the F.D.A., Mr. Shirvan said, it may then seek an alliance with an American company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the country's success in medical fields, the government and leading business people in Israel are concerned about a shortfall in the long-term financing support for bioscience projects. ''That is why we are creating new vehicles to fund life-science start-ups,'' Mr. Nussbaum said. And major efforts are under way, Mr. Yago said, to expand the Tel Aviv stock exchange and other capital markets for equity and debt investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aim of the Israel Conference is to bring together American companies looking for sources of technological innovation and Israeli companies looking for partnerships and greater knowledge of global markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to establish the proposition that for innovation and development on a global scale, Israel is a safe bet,'' said Sharona Justman, managing director of Step Strategy Advisors, a consultant group with offices in Los Angeles, London and Tel Aviv, and an chief organizer of the conference. Though ''safe'' is not a word often associated with the Middle East or Israel, Ms. Justman noted that through years of regional tension, the economy has grown and venture capital has continued to flow to Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Rechter, an Israeli entrepreneur who founded a successful company in Los Angeles, sees different business strengths in the two countries. ''Israeli companies are great at innovation, while American managers understand strategy and scale, the kind of knowledge you need in a big market like this,'' Ms. Rechter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is co-founder and executive vice president of <span class="companylink">BabyFirstTV</span>, a cable and satellite television channel devoted to programs for parents of children 6 months to 3 years old. Ms. Rechter said she came to the United States in 2003 to start a Hebrew language channel, which operates from New York, before coming to Los Angeles to start <span class="companylink">BabyFirstTV</span> with her partner, Guy Oranim, who headed major advertising agencies in Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For programming, Ms. Rechter relies on child development experts in the United States as well as Hollywood writing talent while animation and postproduction work is done in Israel. Now four years old, <span class="companylink">BabyFirstTV</span> is in 35 countries, in 13 languages and, Ms. Rechter estimated, ''has 120 million viewers worldwide.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, she said, ''the United States remains the dominant market. It might change, but in my business, media, there is the United States, and all the other markets follow. That's why I'm here.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite signs that the nation's biggest banks are stabilizing, more small and midsize institutions are coming under stress as the recession continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> said Wednesday that the number of banks on its list of ''problem'' institutions had grown to 305 in the first quarter, the most since 1994, and up from 252 at the end of 2008. From January through March, 21 small or medium-sized banks failed, and 15 more have gone in the second quarter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings underline the toll the credit crisis continues to take on the nation's smaller banks, which are weighed down by souring commercial real estate loans and mounting losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first quarter results are telling us that the banking industry still faces tremendous challenges, and that going forward, asset quality remains a major concern,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the nation's biggest banks, especially the 19 that recently underwent stress tests by federal regulators, appear to be gaining momentum after most returned to profitability in the first quarter. Many that were virtually insolvent early in the year are finding it increasingly easy to raise capital, and are rushing to strengthen their financial positions now in the event that the economy worsens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, deemed among the weakest of the big banks, said it had raised $26 billion in capital, or 76 percent of the $33.9 billion in common equity the government told it to raise as a result of its stress test. <span class="companylink">PNC Financial</span>, a large regional lender based in Pittsburgh, said Wednesday that it had raised more than $600 million by issuing common stock to meet the regulators' demands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with a two and a half month rise in financial shares, the ability of large banks to raise money is a sign that confidence has returned, at least for now, in the giants of the financial industry. Only a few months ago, their existence as independent institutions seemed to be in question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the ease of raising money calls into question how urgently another move planned by the government to improve the health of the banking industry -- a program to purge toxic assets from bank books -- is needed, Ms. Bair said Wednesday. If banks can raise capital without taxpayer backing, that could allow them to keep such assets until the value rebounded with an improving economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>, said investors were treating the 19 biggest banks differently from smaller institutions because the large ones are considered too big to fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a ring fence drawn around the 19 banks,'' Mr. Cassidy said. By contrast, BankUnited of Florida, a big regional bank that was not part of the stress tests, was allowed to go under last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks may still be tested, however. Economists worry that rising unemployment and difficult business conditions will mean a worsening of the loans on banks' books, especially among medium and small banks, which are particularly exposed to commercial real estate loans made in their regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, more American homeowners who once had solid credit are falling behind on their mortgage payments, raising the prospect of an additional wave of foreclosures that could exacerbate bank losses and add pressure to the financial system and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are bracing for worse losses on credit cards. On Wednesday, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, said this business could lose 9 percent in the second quarter and bleed money for the rest of the year. Card losses from <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, the Seattle-based savings and loan that <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> bought last year, were expected to rise especially sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks charged off $37.8 billion in bad loans in the first quarter, the F.D.I.C. said, almost twice the $19.6 billion in the same quarter a year earlier, a sign of further deterioration in the quality of assets on their books. The amount of loans and leases that were not fully paid off rose by $59.2 billion in the quarter, and were $154.3 billion higher than last year, the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while better trading revenues at big banks helped the industry turn a first-quarter profit of $7.6 billion, compared with a loss of $36.9 billion in the fourth quarter, banks and savings and loans set aside $60.9 billion in the first quarter to cover potential losses, an increase from $36.2 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rising number of bank failures could shrink the amount of insurance for deposits in the F.D.I.C. fund. One widely watched measure of this ratio fell to 0.27 percent in the first three months of the year from 0.36 in the fourth quarter. Last week, the F.D.I.C. sought to replenish the fund by levying an emergency fee on banks proportionate to the size of their assets, a move that big banks complained would favor smaller banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Plesser, a banking analyst at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> in New York, said smaller banks were more vulnerable to a souring economy than larger institutions because they were more specialized or focused on a particular region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the repercussions of the failures among the smaller institutions were not as severe for the overall economy as they would be if a larger bank stumbled, he said. ''The big banks are more important to the economy,'' Mr. Plesser said. ''It's not as big a hit if the small fail.''</p>

Some days he wears a T-shirt that says, ''Ask me about my Vow of Silence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only monastery to employ laypeople, but the monks and the women here have a surprising symbiotic relationship. The monastery had tried various self-supporting enterprises before: moving and rehabilitating houses scheduled for demolition, growing shitake mushrooms, developing a golf course and corporate retreat center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, the monks were in the midst of a big report on the golf project when the printer ran out of toner and Father McCoy went to order more. ''I thought, that's way too much for a bunch of black dust,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He discovered it was possible to buy new and recycled cartridges at a fraction of the cost charged by office supply companies. He started LaserMonks in 2002 with the idea of marketing to charitable groups, but the business expanded so fast that soon they were scrambling to keep up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Caniglia and Cindy Griffith were looking to sell their online ink and toner business, based in Loveland, Colo., and called Father McCoy to see if LaserMonks wanted to buy their database. They hit it off, and soon the women were driving to rural Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was scared to death,'' said Ms. Griffith, 50, a Web designer and divorced grandmother who is not Catholic. ''I've been to Catholic weddings, but I don't know anything about monks. Do they talk? What do I do when they pray? Do I sing this stuff? I don't know Latin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The women stayed in the monastery's hermitage overlooking the Mississippi River. Two weeks became two months, then six. The women shared their skills at database management and Web design, but also ideas for the future of LaserMonks. The monks gave the women a taste of a life that was contemplative, balanced and simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was a yuppie, I wanted to make a lot of money, drive a nice car and belong to a tennis club,'' said Ms. Caniglia, 41, who is Catholic. ''I've just learned to simplify my life, and I get joy out of seeing the stars at night, walking the dogs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The women now live on the top two floors of a small house on the monastery's property, above the office and overlooking fields of soy and corn. Ms. Caniglia and Father McCoy send e-mail messages to each other daily, but meet only every three weeks. The women and monks all come together on feast days and holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever entrepreneurial, the women also sell products made by other monasteries, including chocolates, pralines and a barbeque sauce called ''Burnt Sacrifice.'' They sell Benevolent Biscuits, dog treats the monks here make on cookie trays in the monastery kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their latest product is a laser printer cartridge made with soybean oil instead of petroleum. Holding up a newly printed page, Ms. Caniglia said, ''It's environmentally safe, the print is great,'' and it produces more pages per cartridge than an oil-based cartridge at a lower price. ''It's a no-brainer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LaserMonks took in $4.5 million in revenue last year, she said. Expenses and the cost of products are 80 percent, leaving 10 percent for the monastery and 10 percent for charities. The two women made about $60,000 combined. (''It isn't about the money,'' Ms. Caniglia said.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While LaserMonks hums along without monks, the monks are free to develop their talents and hobbies. The Rev. Robert Keffer paints and sculptures, Brother David Klecker sews vestments and takes photographs, Brother Joseph Watson does woodworking, Brother Adam Mathews tends the property and Brother Stephen Treat writes a blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing at his easel in a sunny studio, Father Keffer dabbled at a painting of St. Bernard, whose hair looked a bit too 1980s blow-dried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Professional artists come visit,'' Father Keffer said, ''and they say to me, 'You're in my idea of heaven.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurance industry says it wholeheartedly embraces a health care overhaul, promising Congress and the president that it will make it much easier for individuals to buy insurance on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers, for example, have agreed to sell policies even to people with pre-existing medical conditions, and to stop basing prices on how healthy or sick someone is. These sweeping concessions would help legislators achieve their goal of putting health coverage within reach of many of the nearly 50 million individuals who currently have none.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, the industry has made no such promises about another segment of the health insurance market, one responsible for many people being uninsured in the first place: the market for small employers. By some estimates, about half of the nation's uninsured are people who are self-employed or work for a small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, policy analysts and others say, unless the insurance industry is willing to give some of the same ground to small businesses that they have ceded to individual policy holders, a big part of what is wrong with the nation's health care system may not get fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40 percent of the private American labor force works for companies with fewer than 100 workers. Leaving small businesses out of the federal effort to overhaul health care would be ''a big hole in any reform proposal,'' said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit health care research group that advocates significant changes to the current system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employer-provided medical insurance remains the bedrock of the nation's health care system. And yet, while most big employers still provide health benefits, soaring premiums have meant many small businesses can no longer afford to cover their workers. But the small-employer market remains one of the most profitable segments of health insurance, which may be why the industry is not eager to overhaul this lucrative part of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lobbyists for small employers argue that Congress should be forcing the same concessions from insurers in the small-business market that the industry has promised in the individual market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For us, there is a huge issue in not only addressing just one of the broken markets, but two of those broken markets,'' said Michelle Dimarob, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade association for small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurance industry's main trade association, meanwhile, is notably silent on the issue. And individual insurance companies seem divided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some large insurers, like <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> and Cigna, say they would generally support similar federal rules for both the individual and small-business markets. ''We need to be relatively consistent,'' said H. Edward Hanway, Cigna's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of the biggest insurers, WellPoint, opposes changing the way coverage is sold to small employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those markets generally work today,'' said Bradley M. Fluegel, the chief strategy officer for WellPoint, which is a big operator of Blue Cross plans and a major player in the small-business market. ''They are well regulated by states today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small employers do not necessarily agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We face almost the same challenges as individuals,'' said Michael Boucher, who runs his own landscape architecture firm in Freeport, Me. He provides coverage to more than a dozen people, paying $1,100 a month for a worker with family coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the Congressional talk about health care has not yet focused on what federal oversight, if any, might be necessary for the small-business market. Proposals before the Senate Finance Committee seem to envision the same kind of rules for both the individual and small-business markets. And some House members seem to lean in that direction, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For small businesses already under enormous financial strain, rising health care costs simply add more pressure,'' said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a New York Democrat who heads the House committee on small business and plans to hold hearings on the topic on Wednesday. ''Meaningful health care reform will need to include small-group market reform.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She favors giving small employers additional tax credits for offering health benefits, and letting them form purchasing pools to obtain cheaper coverage from insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Congress finally comes up with, of course, is still anyone's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike large companies, which tend to self-insure and can spread medical risks over a large work force, small businesses typically rely on an insurer to help assume that risk. And they buy that insurance much the same way individuals currently do, in a market overseen by a patchwork of state regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So small employers are at the mercy of the same practices that make it hard for individuals to obtain coverage -- like insurers' trying to avoid covering older people or ones likely to run up high medical bills, and charging high prices for the policies they do offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We struggle every year to find a way to make it work,'' one small-business owner, Kelly Conklin, said at a Congressional hearing in late April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Conklin's woodworking company, Foley-Waite Associates, in Bloomfield, N.J., paid premiums of about $4,600 a month last year to cover 13 employees. Foley-Waite picks up about three-quarters of that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When his insurer said this year that it would raise the premiums to about $6,000 a month, he was forced to switch carriers, finding another policy for about $4,800 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current system is ''designed to be expensive,'' Mr. Conklin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, fewer small businesses are offering coverage -- especially the very smallest employers. About half of companies with nine or fewer workers do not provide health benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WellPoint says the health care answer for the smallest businesses might be to group them with people who buy coverage in the individual market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth Group</span>, by some measures the nation's largest health insurer, agrees that the very smallest businesses should operate under the same rules now being proposed for individuals. But the company declined to discuss whether it would favor changes for somewhat larger employers, in the absence of a specific proposal in Washington for handling small-business insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the current system, individual states determine how much more an insurer can charge one small business than another, based on the relative health of each work force. And it is the state that determines how much an insurer can raise rates from one year to the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot of variation across states,'' said Gary Claxton, an insurance expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. He also noted that many states lack the resources necessary to actively enforce their rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other insurers that have not embraced changes are ones that, like WellPoint, operate Blue Cross plans, which tend to be the largest players in a state's small-business market. The <span class="companylink">Health Care Service Corporation</span>, a Blue Cross operator in big states including Texas and Illinois, would not discuss its position on the issue. The national association representing Blue Cross plans also declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fluegel, the WellPoint executive, warned that if the federal government intervened in the small-business market so that insurance companies could no longer assign the highest premiums to employers with the highest medical costs, insurers would be forced to spread the costs over all their small-business customers. That could mean some small employers would end up paying more for coverage than they do today, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Dimarob, of the independent business federation, says the small-business market even now is ''dysfunctional,'' which is why she argues that the federal government needs to step in and work with the states to remake the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you truly want to build off the strength of the employer-based system and want comprehensive health reform and access to quality affordable health care,'' she said, ''why would you only fix the individual market?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- Monday is the slow night that comedy clubs traditionally reserve for amateur open-mike night, and that's not too far from what was happening on a recent Monday at the Helium Comedy Club here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 small-business owners, self-employed professionals, and individuals arrived by 7 p.m., mingled over chicken fingers, checked one another's name-card stickers and talked shop. Then Ami Kassar stepped to the microphone in a T-shirt and jeans and thanked everyone for coming.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being an entrepreneur, a small-business owner, it's kind of lonely sometimes,'' Mr. Kassar said. ''What bloblive is trying to do is to create a community. Tonight when you come up and share an idea, something just might trigger for you. Someone will give you feedback or offer you a connection that could help you take your idea to the whole next level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he solicited a warm welcome for Steve from Philadelphia, passed the microphone, and the blobbing had begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kassar is president of Ideablob Corporation, which has been holding weekly bloblive blob events in Philadelphia and Santa Monica, Calif., since March. The concept, as Mr. Kassar explained it, is a new kind of social network for entrepreneurs, helping to promote sharing and development of small-business ideas. In addition to the live events, the company runs ideablob.com, where visitors post business ideas in monthly contests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The posted idea that gets the most public votes wins $10,000. On stage and on the Web site, the ideas are called blobs -- a prospective buzzword intended to suggest that the ideas are like lumps of clay, potent but unstructured, ready to change into whatever shape will help them thrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a service to the small-business community with some growth potential. And right now the whole enterprise exists like a circus tent in a tornado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideablob is owned by the <span class="companylink">Advanta Corporation</span>, which spun off the unit in 2007 as a project of Mr. Kassar's innovation department. Yes, that Advanta: the big issuer of credit cards to small businesses, based outside Philadelphia in Spring House, Pa., that recently entered lockdown mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, in the wake of a $76 million first-quarter loss, Advanta said it would suspend further lending to its cardholders, meaning that as many as a million account holders would need to find credit elsewhere. Last week, the planned credit freeze date of June 10 was moved to May 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Advanta is still in business, collecting payments from existing customers, the company's future is in question. But for now, the blobs will carry on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're plugging away,'' said Mr. Kassar, who landed at Advanta eight and a half years ago as a refugee from a failed start-up during the Internet bubble. Even Advanta's chief executive, Dennis J. Alter, is standing behind the blobs, for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A logical question would be, 'With earnings and losses and delinquencies being what they are, how come you're doing this?' '' Mr. Alter said. ''Well, as I'm sure as you can tell, putting on one of these events is not very expensive. For about $1,000 an event, we're in a way branding Advanta as being valuable to the small-business owner or start-up. Six months from now, maybe we have bloblives in 30 cities around the country. Or maybe we don't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly why Advanta needs to brand itself for small businesses -- now that its future in serving them is in doubt -- is not entirely clear. Mr. Kassar said the company was keeping its options open. ''We may well be active in that market again. Anything is possible.'' The first live blob event is free, after that it costs $10 for a single event or $20 for all the events in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those who have shared their blobs on the Web site and on stage have come away feeling warmly about Advanta. Naomi Bar-Yam, executive director of the Mothers' Milk Bank of New England, said the $10,000 ideablob prize that her nonprofit group won in January 2008 went toward equipment and education. ''People don't even know what a milk bank is,'' she said. The group stores and distributes human milk, but just as important, ''it put our name out there,'' she said. ''We got some attention in places we might not have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Allison, then a student at Pennsylvania State University, won the $10,000 prize in May 2008 for a concept called BrioBody, a portable touch-screen device with personal training software that would link to a Web site and track an individual's fitness. His prize ''went straight into development of the Web site,'' he said, and he was able to raise an additional $25,000 in part because of the ''market validation of ideablob.'' (BrioBody, like a true blob, has changed; when it begins, it is will be just a Web site, a sort of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for fitness.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bloblive events are free-form and social and occasionally silly. There are no cash prizes, just feedback. Viable business ideas share the night with individuals grasping for what they might do next and how to start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You hear a lot of 'How do I...?' '' said Jeffrey Donnon, a finance manager at a Philadelphia venture capital firm, First Round Capital, who has attended several of the events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like stand-up comedy shows, some people taking the stage are natural performers and some have terrific material -- but one does not guarantee the other. When Mike Klusek described PhillyGoesSolar.com at the Helium club, he was holding the microphone too low, looking down to read a prepared statement. His idea was a Web site where consumers can share experiences installing solar power products: Web 2.0 meets Energy 2.0.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was merely a concept. Mr. Klusek was offering equity in exchange for help from a Web designer. Live video of the event was captured and streamed on the Web, and online viewers commented through a Twitter feed that was projected on a wall. Someone on Twitter suggested that Mr. Klusek look into the Web site elance.com to hire a freelancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the dynamic of the live event -- how it transcends a simple business-card swap -- is that each blob presentation becomes something of a puzzle for audience members to solve, challenging them to add expertise. When Jeff Greene presented a plan to help cities generate revenue by leasing library space to businesses after hours, the room went silent as the audience digested the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are thinking. Their brains are ticking,'' Mr. Kassar said. Someone suggested creating a database to match available spaces with groups that might need them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up was Jason Wisdom, whose idea was to print reference books on toilet paper. The crowd groaned. Someone suggested a gag name for the product. Mr. Kassar said, ''Are we at a comedy club or an ideas night?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bloblive events continue this week in Santa Monica, and next week in Philadelphia. The company is about to announce the $10,000 winner for May's online contest. It was suggested to Mr. Kassar that, during its next live event at a comedy club, the company could take suggestions for how ideablob might continue to thrive despite Advanta's struggles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appropriately, he laughed.</p>

According to the April index of Discover Small Business Watch, compiled by <span class="companylink">Discover Financial Services</span>, 38 percent of owners were a member of an online social networking community, up from 22 percent in October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles H. Matthews, president of the International Council for Small Business, said the key was to view the sites as tools, not toys. ''It can certainly help enhance the process of identifying customers, especially in niche markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Brighter Planet, the niche is the environment. Before Earth Day, for example, it sponsored Earthtweet, an Earth Day Tweet-a-Thon, which has generated 4,200 conservation Tweets and 2,500 followers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, BrighterPlanet.com will feature a portable social Web application that will allow visitors to calculate the status of their carbon footprints and share what they are doing on conservation on other social platforms like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends, family and colleagues can immediately see how saving the environment is important to BrighterPlanet members, Ms. Prairie said. ''That's what we find is the beauty of social networking, particularly for environmental-type causes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study for Sage North America found that 65 percent of small businesses that used social networking sites said that they felt more comfortable doing so this year than they did last year, and 51 percent said that they had acquired and retained customers because of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 260,000 North American businesses currently use social networking to promote their businesses, Mr. King said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Sage, which has 2.9 million small and midsize business customers, introduced its own networking site, SageSpark .com. ''We know we're not the first to the game,'' Mr. King said. ''Our twist really is the community, tools and services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other niche sites have sprouted recently, like Shustir.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Shustir.com introduced its virtual marketplace, which was started by two former <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> colleagues, Shu Kim and Khanh Pham. ''It matters where you spend,'' Ms. Kim said, echoing the site's catchphrase. The goal, they said, is to keep Main Street U.S.A. alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want you to spend with small businesses,'' Ms. Pham said. ''By doing so, 80 percent of the money goes directly back to the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is arranged so owners can create virtual storefronts with photos, video, blogs and store information, and communicate with customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Shustir gives consumers a one-stop destination,'' Ms. Kim said, where they can buy from trusted businesses, post about their favorite shops and make recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses can exchange advice, ideas and information, and network on a site that provides them search optimization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its second phase, Shustir will add <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter badges so owners can use other social media to build business. There will also be a shared community calendar. ''The call to localism is existing across the country,'' Ms. Pham said, ''because small business is suffering.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PartnerUp has been around longer. It is a social networking site that helps entrepreneurs and small-businesses owners find partners or co-founders, network, ask for and offer up advice, find resources and create or join groups based on their interests. It was founded in 2005 and acquired by the <span class="companylink">Deluxe Corporation</span> in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PartnerUp has more than 100,000 active members, and more than 300,000 unique business owners and entrepreneurs come to the site every month, according to Steve Nielsen, its president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're at an inflection point now,'' Mr. Nielsen said, ''where social media sites that are specific to a purpose for a market are going mainstream, and they're not just for early adopters any more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2007, David Reinke joined PartnerUp for a specific purpose. He had quit corporate America to start a fashion rating Web site, StyleHop.com, but needed a partner well versed in technology. He posted a profile on PartnerUp, and a job description for a chief technology officer and said, ''Let's see what happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a month later, Froilan Mendoza, who had 12 years experience building technology start-ups, contacted him and after a series of discussions, Mr. Mendoza quit his job to become chief technology officer of StyleHop.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning to PartnerUp, Mr. Reinke said, was consistent with how he uses online sites. ''I was looking for something specific. I go to the source where the experts are,'' Mr. Reinke said. PartnerUp also allowed for a quiet search and limited exposure, he added, so thousands of people would not know about his start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the majority of smaller concerns have not caught the online wave. In its monthly index, Discover noted that 62 percent of businesses still do not have Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, when asked which networking opportunities they used most, 46 percent of small-business owners identified traditional methods like conferences, trade shows, local in-person groups or chambers of commerce. Of the remaining respondents, 16 percent cited ''other'' networking opportunities, 8 percent cited online sites, 7 percent said e-mail messages and 22 percent said they were not sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. King of Sage North America estimates that small businesses have a 12-month window to figure out online social networking. ''I hate to say it, but if they don't, they'll get left in the dust,'' he said. ''It's here to stay.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR entrepreneurs hoping to land start-up capital from angel investors, here's what two recent studies found: Don't get carried away when you pitch your product because the investors may lose interest faster than you can say ''almost unlimited market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one misstep -- like stammering a vague reply instead of saying you do not know the answer -- can also kill a deal, the authors of the studies say.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angel investors are generally wealthy people seeking promising start-ups that are too small to attract the attention of venture capitalists. The estimated 260,500 active angels in the United States are the largest source of seed and start-up capital for entrepreneurs (not counting their own savings or money from family and friends), according to Jeffrey Sohl, the director of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even last year, as the recession gathered force, these angels spent $19.2 billion on more than 55,000 ventures, he said, though that was down from $26 billion in 2007. The average investment for each deal last year was $346,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, venture capitalists made only 440 investments in start-ups last year, putting the bulk of their money in later stages of a company's growth in deals that averaged $7.5 million, Mr. Sohl said. ''Angels provide the seed and start-up funding that turns acorns into trees like <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, <span class="companylink">FedEx</span>, Amazon and <span class="companylink">Google</span>,'' Mr. Sohl said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, entrepreneurs make their initial pitch to angels in an informal session. If their idea is judged to have promise, they may be invited to give a PowerPoint presentation followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With time at a premium, it is imperative for entrepreneurs to come prepared to both meetings with solid arguments about their product's marketability and with evidence of their commitment to their company in the form of sweat equity and their own investment, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But enthusiasm is a different matter, according to a study that was presented last week at an entrepreneurship conference at Babson College outside Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is the trickiest part,'' said Richard Sudek, an angel investor and assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Chapman University in Orange, Calif., and one of the three authors of that study. ''We like you to show some excitement, but don't force it. Being authentic is much more important. There is such a thing as quiet passion. Anything that comes across as slickness is a negative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Mitteness, a doctoral candidate in entrepreneurial studies at the University of Louisville and one of Mr. Sudek's co-authors, was even more emphatic. ''Show your passion,'' she said, ''but don't try to be somebody that you're not. Angels are very leery of too much enthusiasm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another research paper, by Xiao-Ping Chen and Suresh Kotha of the University of Washington and Xin Yao of Wichita State University and published in The Academy of Management Journal in February, came to much the same conclusion. The effects of perceived passion, defined as cues like facial expressions, tone of voice and hand gestures, ''were statistically insignificant,'' the article said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chen, a professor at her university's business school, called the findings ''surprising,'' especially since she and her colleagues often rely on such signals in their hiring decisions. ''You can show your passion through preparedness, how well you've thought out your business plan,'' she said. ''But the style of your presentation doesn't matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What angels are looking for, authors of both reports said, is evidence of a market opportunity with growth potential, a strong management team and an exit strategy, including a list of possible acquirers, since the eventual sale of the companies they invest in is how they make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Also, angels put a high value on trustworthiness,'' said Mr. Sudek of Chapman, a former entrepreneur himself and the chairman-elect of Tech Coast Angels, the largest angel group in the United States. ''If you don't know the answer to a question, say so, and promise to get back to them. Don't fake it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, acknowledging gaps in your knowledge and other weaknesses, and letting angels know you need their help, can add to your credibility, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some other tips from the researchers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memorize an ''elevator pitch'' for your product and its potential in 90 seconds or less. It will bolster your confidence, and you can recycle it to win over customers, vendors and employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider hiring a speech coach, but only one familiar with angel investors' thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attend ''pitching contests'' that many business schools and angel groups sponsor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In presentations, be upbeat but realistic in your profit and revenue projections. Better yet, draw up optimistic, middle-ground and pessimistic projections to show how carefully you have thought them through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted Ray, founder of Ted's Tinctures Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., has some advice for fellow entrepreneurs, even though he is only now starting a quest for $500,000 in angel financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, he said, have a product on the market. ''Nothing speaks more loudly than revenue coming in,'' he said. His two-year-old company, which makes an herbal remedy called FlyRight Jet Lag Formula, had sales last year of $25,000 and is on track to increase that by tenfold this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, do not ask other people for money unless you have spent your own. He has put $105,000 of his savings into his firm and raised $185,000 from family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, the business plan you show to potential investors should be concise. He suggested using software on Angelsoft.net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourth, seek angels with a record of investing in your field -- in his case, consumer products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, he says, explore every angle. ''If an angel says no, ask him for the names of four other angels who might say yes,'' Mr. Ray said. ''My goal is to get 100 introductions to get 10 meetings to get three presentations to close one deal.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Washington debates an overhaul of health care, many small businesses are vehemently opposed to the idea of requiring employers to help pay for their workers' medical coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least one small-business group says the proposals now being considered by the Obama administration and Senate leaders could save small companies tens of billions of dollars a year in health care costs -- even if there is a mandate for employer coverage.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by the group, the nonprofit Small Business Majority, to be released Thursday, concludes that the changes would be better for small employers than continuing the current system, which leaves many of those businesses struggling to afford health benefits for their workers. Half of companies with nine or fewer workers do not currently provide employee coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses want to be part of the system,'' said John Arensmeyer, the group's chief executive. ''They don't want to shirk their responsibilities.'' But ''we need comprehensive reform,'' he added. ''The entire system needs to be fixed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 2005 by executives of small companies who wanted to broaden the small-business discussion about health reform, the group was among those recently invited to the White House to discuss the issues. Mr. Arensmeyer said any mandatory coverage requirements would have to address the inability of some businesses to pay for the contributions. ''This doesn't work in the short term without some assistance to the smallest and least profitable businesses,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis, conducted by Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist who helped advise Massachusetts on its overhaul of health insurance, examines proposals being discussed by the Senate Finance Committee and others in which small companies would have to pay some portion of their payroll toward health benefits but would also receive some form of tax credits to defray the expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses would save in two major ways, Mr. Gruber said. Because small companies traditionally pay much more than large corporations for the same coverage for an employee, they would benefit from proposals streamlining the purchase of insurance and lowering the administrative expenses associated with the policies. The companies, he said, would also benefit from the success of any legislative efforts to contain the rapidly escalating cost of health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the study estimates that the proposals under debate could save small businesses anywhere from $546 billion to $855 billion over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing is done, on the other hand, the study says the health care bill for small businesses -- estimated at $156 billion this year -- would more than double, to $339 billion in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some small-business groups still worry that the proposals now being floated could do more harm than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Federation of Independent Business, an association of small companies, says many of its members do not favor forcing companies to pay a significant share of the cost of employee health coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Eckerly, senior vice president of federal public policy for the federation, said her group was concerned that the proposed measures could fail to contain the high costs of medical care, which she said was a main concern for small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Adding new, additional burdens to small-business owners -- especially in the form of an expensive mandate -- is not an effective approach to reform,'' Ms. Eckerly said. ''In fact, it burdens the very people we are supposed to be trying to help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing overall costs is a critical piece of any proposal, Mr. Arensmeyer agreed. ''Nobody wants anyone to pay into a broken system.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the skills that serve so well in nurturing a family business or start-up may not serve when it comes to investing the money you take off the table, where you're up against other people who spend all day, every day, thinking about stocks and bonds. A friend of mine is a genius at turning $2 million houses into $4 million houses, but he let his banker put his profits into auction-rate securities just before that market froze. Now he can't get his cash to capitalize on today's great housing deals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another friend runs a successful equipment rental chain. He used a margin account to raise cash for some personal expenses, preferring to borrow at low rates and keep his investments in place. But when stocks dived last winter he had to bolt from a lunch to meet a margin call -- not a welcome distraction when he was working around the clock to save his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, some small-business people are great investors. But be honest: if you devote 60, 80 or 100 hours a week to your business, do you really have time to read 100 prospectuses to find 10 good stocks? Many financial experts say that despite their business acumen, business owners tend to be fish out of water as investors, quick to fall prey to overconfidence and a sweet line from a self-serving adviser (or a brother-in-law).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If any of this rings true, this guide and a regular blog feature called The Owner's Money are for you. Their underlying principle: You take plenty of risk in your business; as an investor, you should keep it simple, spread your eggs among many baskets, keep fees and taxes low and tilt the odds in your favor with indexed mutual funds and exchange traded funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, I understand the entrepreneurial mentality. Entrepreneurs tend to be thrill-seekers. They like to test themselves. They like to take chances. For those who want to devote some play money to more aggressive ideas ... well, I'll talk about that, too. That will be fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the smart investor will commit only a sliver of assets to that kind of gamble, certainly no more than 10 percent. For the rest of your money, you should construct a supersimple portfolio, one that requires little maintenance. You could do far worse than to simply split your funds among the following (I explain how to allocate below):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For stocks, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX). It is an index fund designed to mirror the performance of the entire United States stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For bonds, the <span class="companylink">Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund</span> (VBMFX). This, too, is an indexer, designed to track the entire market of investment-grade bonds in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For cash, the Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX). This fund invests in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the federal government. It is relatively safe and has been yielding upward of 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other fund companies, like Fidelity and <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span>, offer similar funds that are perfectly good. I've suggested Vanguard because it specializes in index funds and because, while most fund firms are for-profit operations run for the benefit of shareholders, Vanguard is owned by the people who invest in its products. Vanguard keeps expenses to the bare minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most years, index funds, intended to mirror the market's performance, tend to do better than actively managed funds that constantly scramble for the next hot holding. The average active manager cannot beat the market, and trying to do so, he racks up costs that chew away at returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The model portfolio above is aimed at conforming to what I consider nine proven principles for keeping an investment strategy simple while enhancing prospects for solid returns over the long term. These principles are meant as a starting point rather than a final plan. Use them to guide your do-it-yourself investing, or to put the burden of proof on any adviser who suggests something more complex. Your first question should be: ''Why would that be better than the simple strategy I'm already following?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The keep-it-simple approach can help you sleep at night, free of the second-guessing and doubt that plague aggressive traders seduced by the latest fads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALLOCATE PROPERLY. Study after study concludes that the single most important factor in investing success is asset allocation -- the mix of stocks, bonds and cash in a portfolio. Over the long term, stocks have earned in the neighborhood of 10 percent a year, enough to double your money every seven years. But stocks -- as we've been reminded recently -- are too risky for money you will need in the next five to 10 years. The bulk of that money should go into bonds, which are less volatile, though also less profitable, averaging returns of around 5 percent a year. Cash, like bank savings and money-market funds, is very safe but generally earns nothing once inflation has done its damage. A common rule of thumb says one should keep enough cash for 6 to 12 months of expenses. Of the remaining holdings, the bond portion should equal one's age, i.e. 50 percent for a 50-year-old. The rest of your portfolio should be in stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVOID CONCENTRATION. People who own businesses or have large stock positions in companies they work for often have too many eggs in one basket. By diversifying -- spreading money among a wide variety of holdings -- you reduce overall risk, since some holdings may be up while others are down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INCREASE YOUR SAVINGS RATE, In the 1980s and '90s people used large investment returns to build their nest eggs, but returns have been far less impressive in recent years. To overcome ho-hum returns, investors need to put more money aside every month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USE FUNDS AND E.T.F.'S. The easiest way to diversify and get inexpensive professional management is to invest in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which are similar to mutual funds but traded like stocks. A single fund can have dozens of stocks or bonds, sometimes hundreds. Very few individual investors are good enough at picking stocks and bonds to beat the performance they can get from funds, especially when broker commissions and other trading costs are factored in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USE INDEXING. Rather than try to pick hot stocks or bonds, a large class of mutual funds and E.T.F.'s simply buy and hold securities that reflect an underlying index, such as the Dow Jones industrial average or <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index. Many studies have shown this to be more successful than ''active management,'' largely because few active managers can consistently pick market-beating investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MINIMIZE TAXES AND FEES. The average actively managed fund charges annual fees equal to about 1.3 percent of the fund's assets, while good indexers charge less than 0.2 percent. In other words, if the managed fund earned nothing over 10 years, fees would reduce its value by 13 percent, while they cut the indexer's value by only 2 percent. Taxes are similarly damaging, and investors are wise to pick funds that keep annual tax bills to a minimum. Indexers minimize taxes by rarely selling assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVOID ZERO-SUM GAMES. Options, futures and forward contracts are aggressive, speculative instruments that can earn large profits -- or suddenly become worthless. For every dollar won, a dollar is lost by someone else. In the stock market, by contrast, the average investor makes money because the average stock rises in value over time. Individual investors dabbling in options and similar holdings are playing a sucker's game against experienced pros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHUN LEVERAGE. With a margin account at a brokerage, you can invest $2 for every dollar you have, using your holdings as collateral. A 10 percent gain in an asset's price will thus give you a 20 percent profit. But leverage amplifies losses just as much. If your holdings fall in value, the broker may issue a margin call, requiring you to put up more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KEEP TIME ON YOUR SIDE. Investing is a long-term game. Though the recent downturn has shaken a lot of people's confidence, recoveries from bear markets tend to be spectacular. It's very rare for stocks to trail bonds or cash over periods of five or more years. To get the long-term gains you read about -- 10 percent a year for stocks, for example -- you have to leave your money in the market and reinvest all dividends and interest earnings. Many people who pull out of the market in downturns wait too long to get back in, missing the bulk of the rebound.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A picture caption on Wednesday with an article about foreign banks capitalizing on financial turmoil in the United States to increase their business misidentified the job held by Paul Calello of Credit Suisse, one of the banks that are challenging American banks. He is head of Credit Suisse's investment bank -- not head of investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Jun 20 2009 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's great investment houses have never faced a serious foreign challenge in their own backyard. But as tectonic shifts reverberate through the banking industry, their overseas rivals are edging into some of the most lucrative corners of American finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss, Germans, British and Japanese are grabbing business from once-swaggering American banks by taking companies public, underwriting new bonds and advising corporations on mergers and acquisitions. And they are hiring more of their rivals' bankers and traders to continue their winning streak.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while big American banks still tower over global finance, the latest shift, although subtle, is raising some uncomfortable questions, including the big one: Could foreign banks one day do to Wall Street what Japan once did to Detroit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is evidence of traction in market share, and you can see that these banks have leapfrogged,'' said Fiona Swaffield, an analyst at Execution Ltd., a brokerage firm based in London. ''The issue is, how long can this last, and can anyone re-emerge?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last decade, the strongest overseas rivals have tried to climb above their American competitors, often with mixed success. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> of Switzerland sought to become a universal banking powerhouse with its purchase of the United States investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in 2000, only to see the merger sour. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> of Germany tried to do the same with a 1998 merger with Bankers Trust, and met with similar troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, foreign banks have become increasingly aggressive in such activities as debt and equity underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. Ten years ago, for instance, only one bank, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, ranked among the top 10 debt underwriters. This year, four foreign banks crowd the field. Similarly, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> and <span class="companylink">UBS</span> now list among the top 10 global M.&amp; A. advisers. A decade ago, the only non-United States firm was <span class="companylink">Dresdner Kleinwort</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, overseas banks have hoped to capitalize on the turmoil convulsing the financial industry. The demise of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, two of the oldest names on Wall Street, gave them a rare opportunity to press for advantage. So did messy distractions like <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s fraught takeover of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. Meanwhile, many foreign banks have fortified their finances at their regulators' behest, while avoiding the restrictions and stress tests required of many American rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even as American banks start to return to health, efforts by the Obama administration to rein in the industry are likely to shift the competitive landscape in new ways -- a development closely watched by foreign contenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What worries me is the competitive edge that non-U.S. banks have vis a vis U.S. banks,'' said Eugene A. Ludwig, the comptroller of the currency under President Bill Clinton, who now runs the Promontory Financial Group, a Washington bank consultant group. ''Non-U.S. banks generally operate under more coherent regulatory structures than U.S. banks do, which creates imbalances that non-U.S. banks can exploit, especially at a time when their U.S. counterparts are operating under extraordinary constraints.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nine months since it snapped up Lehman's core operations at a bargain-basement price, <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, already one of the biggest risk management and financing firms in Europe, has jumped from a minor player to a major firm in the capital markets business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction was a rare chance for Robert E. Diamond Jr., the American president of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, to take on rivals like <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. It brought the British bank business it never had in equities, M.&amp; A. and equity research, while shoring up its debt underwriting and trading business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> almost doubled its United States work force overnight by buying the remnants of Lehman, the British bank has jumped to second place in global debt underwriting. It is No. 4 in America, with nearly a tenth of the market, more than <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> or <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. This year alone, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> advised on $90 billion of mergers and acquisitions on this side of the Atlantic, more than <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and on par with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, although it still trails the most powerful players, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are one of the few Wall Street firms focused on building this year versus consolidating,'' said Jerry del Missier, president of <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>, based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, the biggest German bank, has had expansion in the United States ''in sight since we bought Bankers Trust in 1998,'' said Seth Waugh, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> Americas. ''We expect to win market share'' in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, trading and wealth management, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, it has gained lucrative prime brokerage business from hedge funds. And it has made strides in mergers and acquisitions, moving to fifth place globally in the first five months of this year, although it is still in only 11th place in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters. The bank recently added 90 new senior employees to its United States staff of more than 12,000 to broaden operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> has also wrested prime brokerage business from rivals while stepping up its United States activity in investment-grade corporate debt, earning $20 billion in the first five months, compared with $29 billion for <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. The second-largest Swiss bank gained ground after cutting costs, curbing risky activities and selling billions of dollars in problem assets to cleanse its balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, said the bank's decision to refuse Swiss government support had given it strategic flexibility compared with its American competitors, which might remain restrained in how they expand or spend their money overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the bank has slipped in at least one field it used to dominate: high-yield capital markets, where it fell to seventh place in the first quarter behind <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, according to Thomson Reuters. But Mr. Dougan is continuing his push to bolster <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s overall business by aggressively hiring top talent from the investment and private banking divisions of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, Lehman, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. The bank is also considering a ''tactical acquisition'' in private banking to siphon even more business from rivals, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we have an opportunity to increase, to really, really increase our position,'' said Mr. Dougan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Japanese are muscling in on Wall Street's turf. Nomura has added about 135 people in the United States since October, mainly in its equities division, augmenting its American work force by 10 percent and moving its global business head to New York, in a sign of the potential it sees.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Gradual stabilization in some economies, a muted recovery in others and a long way to go over all -- that was the picture painted by a cluster of data from Asia on Wednesday after the remarkable slowdown of the last few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, the closely watched Tankan survey of big manufacturers, conducted quarterly by the Bank of Japan, bounced back in June from a record low in March, coming in at minus 48, the bank announced Wednesday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, an official purchasing managers' index rose for a fourth consecutive month in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And South Korea reported that exports in June were 11.3 percent lower than a year earlier, a much smaller decline than the surprisingly poor 28.5 percent fall recorded in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe the current recovery has been confirmed and can be sustained,'' said Fan Gang, an economist who advises the Chinese central bank, Reuters reported. President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, however, said that the government remained cautious about the economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, the Tankan business survey rebounded, but to a much lower reading than economists had expected. While the reading was better than the minus 58 registered three months ago, it remained a negative reading indicating that pessimists still outnumbered optimists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the survey also showed that businesses had become even warier about plans to purchase machinery and other items, suggesting that many would make more layoffs and cut costs as they braced for a prolonged downturn in foreign demand for goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big manufacturers surveyed in the June Tankan said they planned to cut capital spending by 24.3 percent in the year that began April 1. In the March survey, the estimate was 13.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The massive fall in capital expenditure plans has dispelled any optimism about the speed of recovery in Japan,'' said Glenn Maguire, an economist at <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a briefing in Paris, Takatoshi Ito, a University of Tokyo economics professor and a former finance ministry official, said, ''We are nowhere near declaring that we are past the bottom -- that the worst is over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the recovery in the purchasing managers index in China was muted, while a similar index in India slipped to 55.3 in June, from 55.7 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the United States and Europe, the indexes have been above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for several months, showing both countries' relative resilience in the face of the global downturn. The June index for the euro zone, also released Wednesday, rose to 42.6, from 40.7 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, the June reading moved up only slightly, to 53.2 in June, from 53.1 in May. A separate index compiled by the brokerage firm CLSA rose to 51.8, from 51.2 in June, its highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rises reflect big stimulus expenditures in China, which has more leeway than governments elsewhere to pump money into the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Beijing announced a two-year spending program worth 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) which, combined with rate cuts and soaring lending by banks, have propped up the economy and helped offset the impact of falling exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the third straight month in which firms' order books have improved, following a period of contraction that lasted eight months,'' CLSA said in a note accompanying its survey Wednesday, adding that the data also showed that foreign orders had risen for the first time in 11 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But CLSA also struck a note of caution, echoing many economists' warnings that recent global data signaled mere stabilization at this stage, rather than all-out recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists also worry that recent signs of improvement in parts of Asia may be tied to one-time effects like improved credit conditions and the restocking of inventories by companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unfreezing in credit conditions helped provide a boost in recent months,'' said Mr. Maguire of <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span>. ''But we will need a recovery in final demand in Western economies for that to be sustained.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all those small-business owners looking for additional sources of profitable revenue -- and who isn't? -- one option may be to go back to something old-fashioned: the suggestion box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some suggestions about using that old idea effectively.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AN INSIDE JOB The obvious place to start is inside your company. SmallBusiness.comoffers these four ideas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Make it easy. ''Don't enforce rules like: 'Employees may only submit suggestions on Friday afternoons; suggestions must be typed in a 12-point font and must be between 400 and 422 words.' No one is going to jump through hoops like that. Instead, let employees know that suggestions are welcome through any medium -- even that napkin they were scribbling on during lunch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Think positive. Obviously, you won't like every idea. Even so, you don't want to cut off the flow of ideas. So thank everyone who contributes and do so quickly. Positive reinforcement will keep ideas coming in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Brainstorm. If someone brings you an idea that is ''good but not great,'' sit down with that employee ''and a couple of others and do some old-fashioned brainstorming'' and try to get the idea to the point where it is something you can use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Reward the best suggestions. Tangible thanks are always appreciated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REVIEWING THE IDEAS Two common complaints from employees, whenever the idea of a suggestion box is raised, are that the people reviewing the ideas will be too high up in the organization to see what is needed out in the field and that some who make suggestions will lobby for things that benefit only their department (or them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get around both problems, Susan M. Heathfield, writing on About.com, proposes creating ''a cross-functional suggestion review team'' with employees at all levels of the organization to review all suggestions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A SIDE BENEFIT As Rod Sloane points out in his book, ''121 Marketing Ideas to Grow Your Small Business'' (Ecademy Press, 2007), there is an added benefit to offering employees a suggestion box: It could make you aware of internal troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you act on the problems the employees raise, he says, ''a suggestion box will give your staff the message that you are interested in them as people, and not just as workers who get the job done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CUSTOMER INPUT But not only do you want your employees to generate suggestions, you want to hear from your customers as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denise O'Berry, writing on AllBusiness.com, offers these ideas for making that happen:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make it visible. ''The suggestion box should be in a location where it is easy to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask. At the checkout counter, have the person ringing up the sale point out that the company has a suggestion box and would love to hear the customer's ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If at all possible, offer an incentive (monthly drawing or free gift) to customers who do take the time to provide their feedback.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if you only sell online?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can still use a suggestion box,'' Ms. O'Berry writes. ''Just place a link in a prominent place on your Web site and call it your suggestion box.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUTSOURCING Not surprisingly, there are a number of companies that offer to handle the collection of suggestion box information for you, and will survey your customers as well. Interested in potential vendors? Simply type some variation of ''suggestion box productivity'' into an Internet search engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST CALL If you do decide to set up a suggestion box, be careful what kind of message you send, notes Jeff Whitton on SuggestionBox.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A management consultant sent him a photo of a suggestion box at a food court in Singapore. ''There was no paper (suggestion form) or pen for customer to give suggestion,'' the consultant wrote. ''I am quite sure the box was just for show only.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before he started Summit Series, an informal society of some 200 of the world's top young entrepreneurs, Elliott Bisnow was just the head of a $2 million-a-year start-up facing a common challenge for a 22-year-old chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of his peers who were writing ground-breaking software code in high school or orchestrating financing rounds from campus entrepreneur clubs, he was well -versed in the ways of the digital economy. But that didn't mean he had any clue about how to choose the best health care plan for his 20 employees, or whether to pay his sales people salaries or put them on straight commission, or how to dress so that clients and staff members didn't dismiss him as a child.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just had all these questions,'' recalled Mr. Bisnow, now 23, the co-founder and chief operating officer of Bisnow, a Washington-based publisher of e-newsletters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bisnow dropped out of the University of Wisconsin in 2007 to run the company with his father, Mark Bisnow, a longtime radio host and political insider (he was communications director for John Anderson's 1980 presidential bid), who is chief executive. ''My dad was very helpful, but he'd never had his own business before either,'' he said. ''And I couldn't really talk to my friends about this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Elliott Bisnow did what any self-respecting, hyper-ambitious entrepreneur two years removed from his last spring break might do: he organized a group ski trip to the Alta Ski Area in Utah, and he drew up a list of some of the better-known entrepreneurs of his generation, people like Ricky Van Veen, 28, and Josh Abramson, 27, founders of CollegeHumor.com; Joel Holland, the 24-year-old chief executive of Footage Firm, a royalty-free stock-footage house on pace to generate upward of $10 million in sales this year; and Ryan Allis, the 24-year-old founder of direct bulk e-mail service iContact, which claims $30 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of calling them and trying to get a meeting,'' Mr. Bisnow said, ''I decided to convince them all to come to Utah with me. I told them, 'I will fly you for free and pay for the trip if you come.' '' Needless to say, he did not have the money to do that. But that's what credit cards are for (or at least used to be).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that somewhat dubious proposition Summit Series was born. The members now include Evan Williams, chief executive of Twitter; Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>; Tony Hsieh, chief executive of Zappos; Ivanka Trump, vice president for real estate and acquisitions in the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>; and the heads of a lot of other companies started in dorm rooms over the last several years. The group meets every four to six months at the urging of Mr. Bisnow to compare notes, raise money for charitable causes, work on big problems facing the world and hang out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can all sound like a middle-age conspiracy theorist's worst nightmare. Earlier this year, 35 Summit Series members met for a day of private briefings with senior White House staff members to talk about entrepreneurship and the economy. On July 20, another three dozen Summiteers will convene at the private residence of the entertainment mogul Russell Simmons in Manhattan's Financial District (with the celebrity chef Tom Colicchio doing the cooking) to brainstorm with former President Bill Clinton and raise money for the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent gray, muggy afternoon, Mr. Bisnow and two other Summit Series organizers -- Brett Leve, 25, and Jeff Rosenthal, 24 -- were sitting around a long wooden table at the TriBeCa co-op they have sublet in Manhattan for the summer. As they talked about plans for the coming Clinton meeting, another of their colleagues groggily shuffled from one of the three bedrooms in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. Six guys are staying at the apartment, crashing in children's bunk beds and on extra mattresses on the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We decided we each had $1,500 a month to spend on rent and for that either we could each have a bedroom and stay in Hoboken or be right in the middle of everything in TriBeCa,'' Mr. Bisnow explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no blueprint for what Mr. Bisnow and his associates are doing. Perhaps the closest analogy is Davos, if the yearly forum held in Switzerland for billionaires and heads of state were somehow crossed with MTV's ''The Real World.'' Most attendees seem to derive at least as much benefit from the gatherings as Mr. Bisnow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So often, as a young C.E.O., you feel like an island,'' said Ari Goldberg, 27, a former vice president of LRMR, the brand-management company owned by the basketball player LeBron James, and the recent founder of a fashion social-networking site called StyleCaster. ''Then you get to Summit and you look around the room and you see all these other islands. Suddenly instead of being alone it's like you're part of the Bahamas or something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summit Series has evolved. Attendees now arrange for their own transportation and pay $2,500 apiece for room and board. Sponsorships from the likes of Staples, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and the real estate services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> cover the rest and subsidize all or part of the organizers' salaries. With the next multiday event, planned for Miami in early November, the organization should be ''well into the black,'' Mr. Bisnow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Bisnow said that his first priority remains his e-newsletter company. The lively electronic sheets of industry happenings and gossip (there is one for the Washington real estate scene, one for lawyers, another for government tech workers and so forth) show up in 100,000 inboxes several times a week. The company is projecting revenue for 2009 between $2 million and $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After getting to know his fellow young entrepreneurs in Summit Series, Mr. Bisnow moved the company's offices from stuffy sublet space in a downtown Washington law firm to a former storefront on Dupont Circle -- and he stopped wearing suits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where things go from here is less clear. Mr. Bisnow says he plans to continue splitting his time between the ventures. In particular, he emphasized the importance of Summit Series' philanthropic mandate. At a meeting in Aspen earlier this year, a seat at the United Nations board dinner with Ted Turner, Kofi Annan and Queen Rania of Jordan was auctioned off, raising $150,000 to benefit the Nothing but Nets campaign to fight malaria in Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, if one event propelled the organization into the sphere in which Mr. Bisnow hopes to operate, it was the White House meeting. Several Summit members have since opened up direct lines of communications with high-ranking White House economic, environmental and digital policy advisers. There has been talk of follow-up sessions later in the year. Interestingly, though, the event might not have happened if Mr. Bisnow hadn't listened to his mother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last February, Margot and Mark Bisnow were at an Oscars party in Washington when Ms. Bisnow spied Yosi Sergant, then of the White House Office of Public Engagement. ''I wasn't even going to go,'' Elliott Bisnow recalled. ''I'd been playing tennis and I was tired, but my mother called and said, 'Elliott, you really need to get over here.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next week, Mr. Bisnow, Mr. Leve and Mr. Rosenthal were working late on a Friday evening on logistics for the Aspen meeting when Mr. Bisnow's phone flashed with Mr. Sergant's number. Not only had the administration green-lighted hosting a Summit Series event, Mr. Sergant had already locked them in for the following Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I looked at Elliott -- our jaws dropped,'' Mr. Leve recalled. ''Yosi is saying, 'We're taking a shot on you guys. Wereally need you to bring the heat here.... And we need all 35 names and Social Security numbers by end of business Tuesday.' Mind you, this was after hours on Friday. Elliott expressed a little concern about whether we could make the turnaround, and Yosi said, 'Listen, Elliott, when the president's office calls, you answer.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CIT Group is one of the nation's biggest lenders to small businesses. But a debate is swirling in Washington over whether it is large enough -- or important enough -- to save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators and company officials on Monday grappled with whether the New York-based lender should receive more government help, or whether the 101-year-old company, which has already received a $2.33 billion taxpayer lifeline, should be left to go it alone, even if that means its demise.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its heart, the debate is really about whether the administration will draw a line in the sand on banks considered too big to fail, and where any line should lie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since allowing <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> to collapse last summer, federal regulators have been propping up many banks and financial institutions. The fear was that if more big players tumbled, the entire financial system would be at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIT, however, could be the litmus test in that debate. While not small -- with $75 billion in assets it is the nation's 26th-largest bank holding company -- CIT is a small fraction of the size of Lehman or <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, which had $639 billion and $309 billion in assets, respectively, when they failed last fall. Administration officials say they do not believe the failure of CIT would pose systemic risks, as the collapse of such institutions as <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, Citibank and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIT and government officials on Monday explored the possibility of federal assistance to the beleaguered company, but had made no decision by early evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation was described as fluid, and the government could still decide to provide aid, said administration officials briefed on the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outcome could affect hundreds of thousands of small- and midsize businesses across the country that depend on CIT for access to loans to run their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike retail banks, which are largely financed by customer deposits, CIT raises money in the capital markets to lend. When the credit crisis hit, CIT was hobbled, and sharply reduced the credit it offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decision to allow the company to file for bankruptcy would create a potentially awkward situation for the Obama administration. In December, at the height of the crisis, the Treasury Department rushed through an application by CIT to become a bank holding company and flooded it with billions of taxpayer dollars through the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the issue of appearances if the administration allows a lender that services smaller companies to collapse, after stepping in to provide multiple lifelines to <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and other troubled large financial institutions considered too important to let die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'd have an issue of the first firm that they would make an example out of by allowing to fail is one that fills a niche and helps the little guy out,'' said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve official who is now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. At this point in the recession, small- and midsize businesses need access to critical funds as well, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Monday in London that it was in the government's interest to ensure stability in the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm actually pretty confident in that context we have the authority and the ability to make sensible choices,'' Mr. Geithner said in response to a question at a news conference. ''We have a significant interest generally in trying to make sure the financial system gets through this, adjusts where it needs to adjust and emerges stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors interpreted Mr. Geithner's comments as suggesting that the government might not be inclined to help. Still, in a sign of how resilient the financial system has become since credit markets started working again, the broad stock market rose, as did shares of other financial firms, even as CIT's stock fell 12 percent, to $1.35. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Investor Service and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> slashed CIT's credit ratings on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of the last century, CIT engaged in the meat-and-potatoes business of providing loans and leases for heavy machinery, technology equipment and other staples of the manufacturing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But under its current chief executive, Jeffrey M. Peek, a well-liked Wall Street veteran who lost out several years ago in a race to run <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, CIT made an ill-timed expansion into subprime mortgage and student lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two moves -- carried out at nearly the top of the frothy markets before they collapsed -- led to great losses beginning in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIT has $59 billion of long-term debt, including $10 billion that matures in the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also remained severely strained during the credit crisis. While it is registered as a bank holding company and has about $3 billion in deposits in a Utah-based bank, CIT has historically relied on bonds and its ability to tap into the short-term debt market for the money it lends to other companies. It has been trying to raise more money through its bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the Federal Reserve has been extending credit directly to securities firms to stabilize the capital markets since last fall, commercial lenders like CIT are not permitted to borrow from the Fed. In a statement on Sunday evening, CIT said it was also pursing the possibility of obtaining assistance from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> through a program that has allowed <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and other banks to issue their debt cheaply with the backing of the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CIT has applied for access to the program, which provided guarantees for about $334 billion in loans as of July 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., does not view the program as a bailout solution for banks and financial institutions, according to a government official briefed on the situation. Ms. Bair has said repeatedly that she views the program a tool for providing liquidity only to healthy banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more important, the program, which was set to expire this month but was recently extended until October, has plenty of other midsize banks that may need to tap it, said Kathleen Shanley, an analyst with GimmeCredit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The government still has limited resources,'' Ms. Shanley said. ''Now that a certain level of stability has been restored to the market, it may be time to signal that we can't support everyone all of the time.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- Using only strips of canvas and a little rope, Scott Peterson walked up a 50-foot flagpole here to remove a star-spangled banner with reds faded pink. His ancestors used the same method: the family business, originally Harold A. Peterson Steeplejack, opened in 1926.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it will probably close in 2009. The Great Recession, especially its stranglehold on credit and new construction, appears to have mortally wounded what the Depression could not kill.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not 'Oh, I don't have a job, I have to go find a new one,' '' Mr. Peterson said. ''We're losing a corporation that is 83 years old. We're losing our house. We're losing our credit. We're losing, other than our own physical bodies, everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recessions, like bullies, always pick on the weak, but few victims feel more beaten down these days than the millions of Americans with family businesses. Most run small operations with just a few employees, and failure often means closing an office with a parent's name attached and deciding which relatives to fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have been hit hard since the labor market began to weaken. Businesses with one to 19 employees, nearly all of them family run, lost 757,000 jobs from the second quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2008, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, broken down by company size. That amounts to 53 percent of all private-sector losses for a group of companies with about 20 percent of all employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent surveys by the National Federation of Independent Business also show that small-business owners are reporting lower profits and fewer plans to add inventory or spend capital than at any time since the group began asking such questions in 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Dunkelberg, the federation's chief economist, says the market is being ''cleansed'' of unneeded goods and services, but other researchers emphasize that this ignores the broader civic and social role that companies like H.A. Peterson and Sons have played since Paul Revere took over his father's silversmith business in 1754.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Outside looking in, people don't understand that business has often been an organizing point for the family,'' said Blaine McCormick, a professor at the Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University, who worked in his family's oil business growing up. ''Everyone works in it; it's our livelihood and it's a meeting place where we form our identities and the stories that carry us through life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Petersons' company began in New Jersey with Harry Hagan, a German immigrant who learned rigging at sea and taught his stepson, Harold A. Peterson Sr., how to use ropes to lift objects or himself. They opened the business together when Mr. Peterson was just 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flags were initially just a sideline. ''Most of it was repairing steeples, smokestacks, water tanks, and painting them,'' said Harold Peterson Jr., 80, who said his father brought him into the business before he could shave, too. The elder Mr. Peterson made Junior, at age 14, scale a 125-foot wooden flagpole at a local school to fix a broken rope; later, the pair worked as a team, installing flags and building radio towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We traveled not like father and son,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''We were more like brothers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family moved to Florida in 1964. By the time Scott and his two older brothers reached high school a decade later, the steeplejack business had mostly petered out. Mr. Peterson went to work for Eastern Airlines -- until at a family picnic, Scott and his brothers asked him to teach them how to climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Learning for the first time was tough. Walking up a vertical cylinder that narrows to a diameter of a few inches requires the balance of a dancer. The canvas slings are as narrow as toilet paper, lashed to the pole with rope, then placed under the left thigh and right foot. Stepping up is possible through leverage and friction, but a little wind or the slightest lean means spinning around, flipping or crashing to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Climbing a flagpole and doing the work we do, being out in the middle of the air, over hundreds of feet off the ground, it's a rush,'' Scott Peterson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his older brother Mark persuaded their father to leave Eastern and revive the business. This time, they named it H.A. Peterson and Sons, and focused exclusively on flag installation and repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They did pretty well in the 1980s and '90s by piggybacking on the construction boom. Working together -- at its peak, the company had six employees, all related -- they installed flagpoles at the Miami Dolphins' new stadium, in countless new condominium developments and at the homes of Sylvester Stallone and the boxing promoter Don King. During its best years, the company brought in $500,000 in annual revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many owners of family businesses, the Petersons also sewed themselves into their community. They signed on to maintain flags at local schools, worked with the Boy Scouts, teaching children the ceremony for burning used flags, and even now, they give some of their poorer, patriotic residential customers new flags for free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peterson Sr., who stopped climbing only a few months ago to take care of his ailing wife, said he would be heartbroken and ashamed if the company closed. He said he wanted to see the company's $120,000 in debt repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've established ourselves as people of integrity,'' he said. ''That integrity would be shot to hell if we said, 'O.K., it's bankruptcy. Goodbye.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Peterson, 50, said that at this point he was just trying to make their monthly overhead of $15,000. He applied this spring for a loan backed by the Small Business Administration, but he said it was rejected because his credit score was too low -- after several credit card issuers cut his credit limits despite on-time payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flag maintenance, an anachronism even before the recession, has now become his main income source. On one recent workday, he drove his 1993 GMC van with 250,000 miles to jobs at three separate flagpoles, and each earned him around $160.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not enough monthly to keep it even,'' he said, sweat pouring off his bald head after descending the last pole of the day. ''We're just going down and down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stress has already taken a toll. His wife, Arelis, is now the company's only other employee, and when asked what she made of their predicament, she started crying. Their two daughters, 8 and 11, are struggling to understand why their mother can no longer afford lunch at <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, and their father no longer sleeps through the night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The anxiety attack is instant,'' Mr. Peterson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing businesses like his disappear all around his office in a small industrial park does not help. Of the six spaces here, two are now marked with red ''for rent'' signs. A third is on the way, and Mr. Peterson said he just hopes his company will not be the fourth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reality is that you try and stay away from realizing that everything is about to go away,'' he said. ''We're about to lose everything that we have.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT has been a long time since the word ''optimism'' was spoken in the same sentence as ''New Orleans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a small group of entrepreneurs has been using that word lately to describe their efforts to attract small businesses to New Orleans. For now, their enthusiasm may be greater than their results. But they say the city's low rents and business tax incentives along with its music and culture have proved to be powerful lures, despite the still-halting efforts to get past the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing the exact same thing here that we saw in the Bay Area in the mid '90s,'' said Michael Hecht, 38, president of Greater New Orleans Inc., a nonprofit economic development agency. He moved to New Orleans in early 2006 after time in both San Francisco and New York. ''There's a sense of opportunity and possibility, combined with people who have the horsepower to actualize those possibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Hurricane Katrina, at least four formal entrepreneurial hubs have been established in New Orleans: Entrepreneur's Row, the Icehouse, the I.P., (an acronym for Intellectual Property) and the <span class="companylink">Entergy</span> Innovation Center. While they all hope to help nurture individual businesses, they are not technically incubators. Instead, they house start-ups and established companies while focusing on ''clustering like-minded entrepreneurs to build their businesses together,'' said Tim Williamson, 44, the co-founder and chief executive of the Idea Village, a nonprofit group founded in 2000 that helped created the I.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, they seem to be doing something right. According to the Louisiana Workforce Commission, the New Orleans metropolitan area reported an increase of nearly 100,000 nonfarm jobs from October 2005 -- soon after Katrina -- to June 2009. By 2016, the commission expects New Orleans area employment to grow 24 percent from 2006 levels, or to 98.8 percent of pre-Katrina levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has never been a better time in Louisiana for the creative class to thrive,'' said Mitchell J. Landrieu, the state's lieutenant governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Guidroz, 27, is one of the entrepreneurs who was persuaded to move to the city. He grew up in New Orleans but was living in Massachusetts and working for Free Flow Power, a renewable energy company, after Katrina hit. ''I wanted to return to help,'' he said. But he said he did not see a strong business reason to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, last year, Sean Cummings, a real estate developer and entrepreneur in New Orleans, randomly found Free Flow's Web site and noticed that the company had a Mississippi River project in the works. Mr. Cummings, 44, a co-founder of a group called Startup New Orleans, invited Mr. Guidroz to visit his offices in New Orleans at 220 Camp Street, a loft building called Entrepreneur's Row. As an extra incentive, Mr. Cummings even offered to give him six months free rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He helped me fulfill my dream of bringing this business to New Orleans,'' said Mr. Guidroz, who moved back in January. ''Until these guys rolled out the red carpet for me -- immediate access to a substantial network in the city and state for getting things done, finding local investors -- I don't think we would have done it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneur's Row was conceived in May 2007, when Mr. Cummings received a phone call from Nicolas Perkin, the co-founder and president of the Receivables Exchange, an electronic marketplace for the buying and selling of commercial receivables. Mr. Perkin had recently gotten married, and he and his bride wanted to relocate to New Orleans from New York. What did Mr. Cummings think?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cummings thought it was a great idea, and the two men set about figuring out how to attract other entrepreneurs to the city. ''To really prosper, New Orleans must focus on the few opportunities where we have a compelling competitive advantage,'' Mr. Cummings said. ''We must likewise recruit entrepreneurs who are drawn to a joyful quality of life. It's a home-run success story. Entrepreneurs are reinventing New Orleans, like Prague after the curtain, like Milan, like a smaller Seattle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with three other business executives, Mr. Cummings and Mr. Perkin came up with Startup New Orleans, a Web-based information service to connect entrepreneurs with the resources they need to set up a new business. In March 2008, Mr. Cummings established Entrepreneur's Row. Today, it is home to nine companies, including the Receivables Exchange; Mr. Guidroz's company Free Flow Power; and Audiosocket, a music licensor. (Mr. Cummings has a financial stake in at least six of the companies.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Icehouse -- a 12,000-square-foot, renovated warehouse in the Seventh Ward, which was severely damaged by Katrina -- opened in April 2008 and now houses seven businesses. They each pay $600 a desk each month, which covers a phone with private number, high-speed Internet, a kitchen and a rooftop deck access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the things we wanted to do post-Katrina was to make sure that our footprint had maximum impact,'' said Robbie Vitrano, president of Trumpet, a branding and business development firm that is managing the building. ''We wanted to be in a neighborhood that was redeveloping.'' Mr. Vitrano, 45, is also a co-founder of Startup New Orleans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the Idea Village and Greater New Orleans Inc. refurbished an 85,000-square-foot building at 643 Magazine Street in the warehouse district and called it the I.P. (Intellectual Property). It has nine tenants, including TurboSquid, a 3-D modeling company; TJ Ebbert and Associates, a disaster management consulting firm; and Carrollton Technology Partners, a technology development company. The building has a cafe, a gym with his and her saunas, business concierge desk and multiple ''brainstorm rooms.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the appeal is that New Orleans is, perhaps, the ultimate college campus for adults. After work, many of the young businesspeople gather for drinks at International House, the boutique hotel in the central business district that Mr. Cummings opened 10 years ago across the street from his loft building. Mr. Cummings and Mr. Perkin also hold monthly meetings at the hotel in which business owners can share war stories and vent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing about this city, like no other -- everybody wants everyone to succeed,'' said Seema Sudan, the owner and director of design at the knitwear company LiaMolly, who moved to New Orleans in October 2007. ''I have never been in a place that is so community-oriented,'' she said. ''Competitive gets you nowhere. It's about being collaborative. And this city is so like that, from the people helping each other rebuild their homes to building businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she also appreciated the quality of life, and the fact that she paid $800 for a 900-square-foot studio in the Garden District, and $1,800 for a three-bedroom apartment with a yard and tree house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years into his project, Mr. Cummings remains enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am blown away by the caliber of talent,'' he said. ''It's a thriving creative culture of invention. And it is growing every day.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While construction workers have been hit hard by the recession, the people who make sure existing homes run smoothly -- plumbers, electricians and the like -- say they are still finding work, albeit not as much as in the good times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've probably dropped about 20 to 30 percent over recent years,'' said Cliff Brookes, who runs a plumbing business in Haddonfield, N.J. ''I'd say 75 percent of my business these days is repair or crisis work, but I guess that is O.K. People are still fixing things when the lines clog up or three of the four toilets in the house are stopped up. Plumbers are lucky because people at least have things that need to be fixed all the time.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not recession-proof, small-business contractors, electricians, plumbers and even car repair shops seem to be weathering the latest economic downturn somewhat better than other businesses. It may not be time for an employed repairman to strike out on his own, but those already established in business are finding ways to keep afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've made sure we have done the right things to show customers we were reliable,'' said Kimberly Williams, the office manager for Integrity Electric, a six-employee business in San Rafael, Calif. Ms. Williams said Integrity had made sure its certifications and memberships in business and craft associations were up-to-date. It renegotiated its rates in the Yellow Pages and has worked to make its name pop up as early as possible in online searches in <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Yelp and other services. She said the company spent $26,000 in advertising last year, but would cut back considerably now, with small work coming in with regularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were just big enough and I think smaller shops just had to go out of business when the commercial work slowed down,'' she said. ''I think we are only $500 a month slower than before, and with the savings in advertising, we are really about even. We're happy with that in a recession.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eustace Kangaju, director of Temple University's Small Business Development Center in Philadelphia, said that during recessions, commercial building stops abruptly, which mostly affects large contractors and individual crafts people. Smaller contractors, though, tend not to have that work to begin with, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small construction-type businesses may lose house-building or large renovation jobs, but there is still a lot of fixing and repairing to do,'' Mr. Kangaju said. ''I would say city businesses are better off than suburban ones in this kind of economy. Philadelphia, for instance, has older housing stock and things need repairing all the time. Not only are they not building many houses in the suburbs right now, but those that are there are newer and probably in less need of repairs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kangaju said his informal survey found there was actually an upsurge in small-contractor activity in the late spring and early summer, which he attributed to people getting tax refund checks and deciding to get those little annoying things fixed. In any case, he said, if contractors are not greedy and are willing to take those smaller jobs, they can probably weather the remainder of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what Stephen Tomiselli Jr. said he had found. He and his father went into a general contracting business in Philadelphia about five years ago when he got out of school and his father decided to go out on his own after a career as a union electrician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still doing pretty well. Oh, people aren't doing the $50,000 bathroom, but we've found people are still wanting to upgrade,'' said Mr. Tomiselli, who employs five other workmen besides himself and his father. ''Maybe the economy isn't as horrible as they say, but then we work in the city and are comfortable taking little jobs. Maybe if you only do big work, you're hurting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brookes, the plumber, said his business normally relied on what customers may see as emergencies anyway. So in down times, he is not as likely as the bigger contractors to have a big drop in work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People might want to bandage things instead of doing a full repair and replacement, but at least they want me to come in and do something,'' he said. ''So while it isn't the greatest right now, I am surviving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Compensation Survey for 2007, the latest year on record, electricians make an average of $23.26 an hour, plumbers $23.92 an hour, and automotive repair and maintenance workers get $18.52 an hour. Those in the auto repair business, Mr. Kangaju of Temple said, are holding up pretty well during the recession. For one thing, much major auto-body work is covered by insurance, which means it is somewhat insulated from business cycles. Further, as fewer people buy new cars, the age of the cars on the road has risen along with the need for maintenance work, if not repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AAA figures show 30 million roadside assistance calls last year, about the same as in 2007. According to the research firm R. L. Polk, the average car in the United States was 9.2 years old in 2007, while the average truck was 7.3 years old, both records. And a survey by the Automotive Service Association showed that 76 percent of repair shop owners expected more work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far, we haven't been affected by anything,'' said Thomas W. Marks, owner of Magnolia Auto Body in the southern New Jersey working-class town of Magnolia. ''Business is good. People are still getting into accidents. Strangely, we are getting more work on sunny days. I think maybe people are daydreaming, or just in a rush to get to work so as not to lose their jobs. It's a shame, maybe, that that is good for us.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two most precious resources for any small-business owner are time and money. That's why when the subject of intellectual property comes up, many owners run in the other direction. They see images of expensive lawyers and use that as an excuse to ignore the topic, reasoning that it is a problem for big companies to worry about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, with the rise of competition through the Internet and on the global market, understanding intellectual property is more critical than ever for small-business owners. Let's explore some of the common fallacies:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. For small-business owners, it's not worth the time or effort to secure intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Lubetzky, chief executive of New York City-based Kind Snacks, had high hopes when he and his company attended the Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, Calif., in March. And who could blame him, since his Kind Plus bars had been named the best new product at the Natural Products Expo East last October?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it didn't take long before Mr. Lubetzky knew something had gone wrong: He kept hearing how one of his competitors had copied the packaging, look and feel of his bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately for Mr. Lubetzky, he had secured crucial components of intellectual property like trademarks, trade dress (the look and feel of a product) and Web addresses after founding his company. Unlike a patent, which can cost up to $25,000 to secure, trademarks and Web addresses can be obtained relatively cheaply and without the aid of a lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the legal documentation to back up his intellectual property rights, Mr. Lubetzky sent the offending company a cease-and-desist letter, which achieved the desired result. ''Too many entrepreneurs forget there is more to I.P. than just patents,'' said Mr. Lubetzky, who happens to be a lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Once I get a trademark, my brand is safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be. But consider what happened to Tracey Deschaine, who runs a restaurant called Dixie Picnic in Ocean City, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Deschaine opened her business in 2006, she secured trademarks on her business name and logo and on the name of her signature item, ''upcakes,'' which are upside-down frosted cupcakes. The problem, she says, was that even though she had obtained the trademarks, someone monitoring the activity on the United States Patent and Trademark Office's Web site had spotted her application and secured upcakes.com as the Web address, or U.R.L., before she could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had no idea that even though I have a trademark, someone else could just go register the U.R.L.,'' she said. ''I wish I had planned ahead and bought the site before I did that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Having a patent gives me the right to produce something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a very fundamental misunderstanding. Actually, what a patent does is give you the right to prevent someone else from producing what your patent covers. ''Having a strong I.P. position helps ensure that other people pay you for your innovation like they would a toll on a road,'' Mr. Kocher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if you do have a patent, there's no guarantee that someone won't try to get around it. There's also no guarantee that you will win if you fight that person. But if you have your I.P. ducks in a row and a commitment to do whatever you can to defend those rights, you do have a fighting chance -- even in a fight against a much larger company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the example of Cryptography Research, a 20-employee technology firm in San Francisco that specializes in data security. Beginning in 2004, the company made the decision to pursue litigation against the credit card giant Visa, which Cryptography asserted was infringing on its patents covering smart cards. To pursue the case against Visa, however, Cryptography's founder, Paul Kocher, knew he needed a serious war chest in addition to his patent portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why he decided to sell off another piece of his business, patents covering technology that protects Blu-ray discs from piracy, to <span class="companylink">Macrovision</span>, which is now known as Rovi, in 2007 for $45 million. ''All of a sudden we became a formidable opponent for someone who thought we couldn't fight,'' Mr. Kocher said. In the end, the gamble paid off, as the two companies settled out of court, with Visa's agreeing to license the technology from Cryptography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. If I have a patent or trademark in the United States, I don't need to worry about the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It depends on your business model. Intellectual property rights, which also include country-specific U.R.L.'s, need to be obtained country by country, some of which protect them better than others. The cost can vary, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, for example, it is notoriously expensive to acquire patents. In addition, the annual fees required to maintain the patents there are often prohibitively expensive for small businesses, said Gary Johnson, chief executive of Blue Spark Technologies, a manufacturer based in West Lake, Ohio, that makes small, flexible batteries used in things like radio frequency identification tags.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have done is to develop a strategy to go after I.P. protection in a limited number of countries that we think we are most likely to sell or manufacture in, like the U.S. and China,'' he said. ''A lot of the choice comes down to what your business plan tells you.'' To decide what your international I.P. strategy should be, consult a lawyer and conduct some cost-benefit analysis to see if expanding your I.P. rights makes sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. People who collect patents but don't actually make anything are ''patent trolls,'' parasites who can make money only by filing lawsuits against real businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term ''patent troll'' was coined in the wake of the epic lawsuit fought between NTP, a small holding company, and Research in Motion, which makes the hugely popular BlackBerry. The focal point of the dispute was a patent for wireless e-mail delivery held by NTP -- something that R.I.M. eventually would pay millions of dollars to license. But what most people remember about the story is the lawsuits and the notion that NTP was somehow in the wrong for trying to enforce its patent, mostly because it didn't make any products itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consider that many inventors never set out to build a company, only to partner with someone who would bring their products to life. Thomas Edison, for instance, received more than 1,000 patents -- many of which he licensed to other companies. ''He created what we might consider the first innovation factory,'' says Mark Blaxill a co-founder of 3LP Advisors, an intellectual property consulting company based in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent example is Trident Design, a company founded by an inventor, Chris Hawker, which patented and then licensed the design for the PowerSquid. Like Edison, Mr. Hawker's company invents products, builds an intellectual-property wall around them and then licenses them to other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PowerSquid is now manufactured by a division of <span class="companylink">Phillips Electronics</span> and sold by a spinoff of Trident called Flexity. ''Our entire business model is leveraging our I.P.,'' Mr. Hawker said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on small businesses has become a flashpoint in the increasingly raucous debate over health care reform. Trade associations are charging that the pending bills -- which would require all businesses to provide coverage to their employees or pay a penalty -- would place a huge financial burden on their members. Republican leaders are doing their best to inflame the fears and opposition of small business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These proprietors would be wise to ignore the rhetoric and take a closer look. A vast majority of small businesses and their workers are likely to benefit greatly. They should be supporting, not opposing, reform.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a little recognized fact that some 70 percent of uninsured Americans come from families with one or two full-time workers. Most of those workers are employed by small businesses that don't offer them health benefits or offer coverage that they can't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses would reap substantial benefits if their employees were insured. Their work forces would likely become healthier, and they would have an easier time attracting or holding talented employees. Even more striking, with health care reform, small firms could buy insurance at substantially lower rates. Lobbyists issue dire warnings that small businesses won't have the money to pay for coverage or to pay the penalties and will have to eliminate a huge number of jobs: more than one million under an early House bill, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such fears are grossly overblown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vast majority of the nation's small employers -- those who have 25 or fewer workers in the Senate health bill or annual payrolls of $500,000 or less in the House version -- would likely be exempted from the mandate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by Jonathan Gruber, a respected health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concluded that those small businesses that are not exempt would see little impact on employment or profits, although employers would reduce wages to compensate for providing added benefits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the chief arbiter of the impact of legislation, has come to similar conclusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's been most lost in the furor is how much most small businesses would benefit from provisions that should make insurance more affordable -- for businesses that already provide coverage and for those that have been deterred from providing coverage by cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses that currently offer coverage often pay significantly more per worker than larger employers do for the same coverage. Under all of the current bills, the smallest employers would gain quick access to new insurance exchanges -- where plans would compete for their business with rates comparable to those enjoyed by large employers. (In subsequent years, slightly bigger firms and possibly even medium-size firms would likely gain access to the exchanges as well.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many small businesses with low-wage workers would be eligible for substantial tax credits to subsidize their coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not all small firms would benefit. One government estimate suggests that 39,000 firms (out of a total of six million small and large employers in the country) would have to start providing benefits or pay a penalty, and another 240,000 that do provide benefits would have to increase their subsidy levels. The penalties for not offering coverage could be relatively small ($750 per worker after exempting the first 25 workers under the Senate bill) or quite substantial (reaching an estimated $2,800 per worker for some firms under the House bill).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no question that the cost of coverage -- which currently averages about $5,000 per individual or $13,000 per family -- or paying fines could take a substantial bite out of the profits of some firms, forcing them to accept lower earnings, reduce wages, shed some jobs or raise prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade groups say the main reason small firms don't provide coverage is that they can't afford to, and they complain that there is little in the reform bills that would reduce medical costs any time soon. But in making that argument, they conflate two issues. It is true that deep-seated reform of the health care delivery system will take years to reduce medical costs. But the cost of health insurance for small businesses could drop quickly once the exchanges are open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some small percentage of companies will suffer, there are good reasons for requiring as many companies as possible to ''play'' -- by offering coverage -- or ''pay'' by paying a penalty. The most important is that the penalties would help deter employers from dropping their own coverage. The number of companies offering health insurance to their workers has been declining steadily, mostly among small firms, and it is important not to accelerate that erosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The play-or-pay provisions could also raise significant money to help cover the uninsured. The penalties alone could raise $52 billion over a decade under the Senate health committee bill and probably much more under the House bill. We see no easy way to ease the pain of the minority of firms that will face very substantial new costs. We'd be inclined to suggest hardship exemptions were it not for the likelihood that creative accountants might make every firm look like a hardship case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bipartisan group within the Senate Finance Committee is considering dropping the employer mandate and substituting a requirement that employers pay only for those workers who end up with government-subsidized coverage. That seems a poor approach because it could deter employers from hiring low-income workers that could saddle them with high subsidy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes good sense to us to require small businesses to contribute to solving a problem that mostly affects their own workers. There also seems little doubt that the small business community would be one of the biggest winners from health care reform.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRESTON, Mont. -- The floor of the broadcast booth at KXZI radio, which is, truth be told, really just Scott Johnston's front porch, slopes gently down toward the yard, as 90-year-old farmhouse porches tend to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnston's antenna, out by the big cottonwood trees that line the road, is not as fortified as it might be either. Unsupported by wires, it sways in the wind, so that when a storm front strikes northwest Montana, the station's signal fluctuates. And even in the best of times, 100 watts go only so far -- the music cannot be heard even in nearby homes because the signal does not penetrate walls very well.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mainstream media it is not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think some of my neighbors don't even know I exist,'' said Mr. Johnston, a bearded 58-year-old who looks more like the folk musician he once was than anybody's idea of a media mogul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But low-power noncommercial radio stations like Mr. Johnston's, which emerged about 10 years ago in a brief window of eased federal regulation intended to foster competition with the big corporate radio chains, might be soon about to roar, some communications experts say -- or at least squeak loudly enough to be heard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bill now before Congress, and considered by some low-power radio advocates to have a good chance of passage this year, would potentially double the number of licensed, low-power stations from about 800 now to perhaps 1,600 or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, technology is shifting the boundaries and definitions of what it means to be local, and even what it means to be radio. Internet streaming and digital wireless reception are combining in ways that could allow almost any station, even one broadcast from a front porch, to be heard anywhere in the world from the next generation of hand-held devices and smartphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A kind of ''aha'' moment on that front arrived for Mr. Johnston earlier this year when a surgeon in Jacksonville, Fla., who listens to KXZI in his operating room via the Internet, signed up to become a financial sponsor. Mr. Johnston has been streaming live since 2004, shortly after his station went on the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My nurses know to have it going when I come in,'' said Dr. Steve Felger, who said he likes the station's quirky musical mix -- bluegrass, jazz, folk and blues -- and the feel of rural Montana that he has come to love through his vacations there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the low-power noncommercial stations that have emerged in the last decade are nothing if not local. One station in St. Paul broadcasts to the Hmong community. A station in Woodburn, Ore., focuses on the interests of farm workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many stations have a religious bent. Mr. Johnston's station is in fact licensed to his church -- federal licensing required a nonprofit organization to sign on -- but the congregation's leaders do not insist on any religious programming and have given him carte blanche to play the music he loves, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These little low-power stations are really, really local in an age when not much else is,'' said Michele Hilmes, a professor of media and cultural studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who has written widely about radio history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnston calls his own, personally devised format ''The Montana Radio Cafe -- Front Porch Radio Served Fresh Daily.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-four hours a day, sometimes on programmed auto-pilot, sometimes with Mr. Johnston behind a microphone, he has woven his own musical tastes, backed by a 21,000-song catalog, into a mixture of the utterly obscure and the only mildly so. He plays compositions by a street musician from Seattle, a Latina jazz singer fluent in four languages and a band from Montana that plays a cockeyed mix of bluegrass and rap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sponsors that pay the bills and the salaries for the station's three employees -- Mr. Johnston, his wife, Marie, and a bookkeeper -- are mostly local too: a ski resort, a chiropractor, a horseshoeing business operated by Mr. Johnston's son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted to create a music-driven station where music gets heard that would never be played on a commercial radio station,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His own picaresque story in ending up here sounds like a lyric from an alt-country song on his playlist. A son of military traditions, he grew up in Colorado, enlisted in the Army, served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970, then tried his hand at the early 1970s folk music scene on the East Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually wandering back West, on his way to Oregon, he paused in Montana and fell in love, first with the landscape and then with Mrs. Johnston, with whom he has six children and who is invariably referred to on the air as ''Marie the Beautiful.'' Through a person he met in church, he got a job in a commercial radio station as a D.J., where he learned the mechanics of radio but also its frustrations -- the strict limits on what music could be played</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His dreams for KXZI, and for low-power radio in general, are a mix of the modest and the grand. Small stations like his, he said, if royalty payments for Web-streaming remain affordable, could have equal footing to compete with the biggest stations in the world, and perhaps force them to become better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a tiny station signal, even with a bootstrap boost from the Internet, is still a candle in the wind. He said he still vividly remembers the night in March 2004 when the station went live for the first time and how he and a friend got in a car and drove, just to see how far they could go and still hear the music. They were perhaps among the only people in the world at that moment who knew of the station and were tuned in, and they sat in a parking lot at 11 p.m. in the town of Whitefish reveling in the magic of that, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its labor force has tripled in size, even as production has slumped. A deal to lure $60 million in foreign capital -- one of only a handful of foreign investments in Iraq's state-owned industries -- collapsed. The American government recently gave the company $2.5 million to keep its main production line operating and its workers out of penury and, perhaps, insurgency.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month the United States and Iraq will gather hundreds of officials and company executives for a two-day conference in Washington intended to send a message that after six years of war, Iraq is open for business, and not just in oil. Now more than ever before, Iraqi officials boast that a trickle of foreign investment -- including the first new hotel in Baghdad since Saddam Hussein's government fell -- is at last poised to be a flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of the company here, though, shows that economic development and foreign investment face more obstacles than security alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-owned industries that dominate the country's economy -- from oil fields to dairies to textile factories -- are as bloated and inefficient as they were in Mr. Hussein's time, arguably more so. They are hobbled by corruption, still sporadic electricity and poor roads and bound by bureaucracy and central planning that leave them unable to compete with a flood of cheap imports from Iran, Turkey and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New legislation intended to regulate investments, land rights, taxes, financial services and consumer protections remains stalled in Parliament. The mere mention of the sort of privatization that swept Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of Communism is anathema to officials here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not after shock therapy,'' Sami al-Araji, the chairman of Iraq's national investment commission, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are after a gradual change from a centrally controlled economy to an open one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki publicly pressed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier this month about ''the need for this conference to be a success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately, though, American officials express concern that it will be little more than a political exercise before Mr. Maliki's re-election campaign unless the Iraqis do more to create a solid foundation for foreign investors willing to take a risk on the country's prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Biden, in his meetings with Mr. Maliki and other senior leaders, stressed the need for better regulatory and financial systems, according to a senior official traveling with him. The official said that reforms would, for example, allow the <span class="companylink">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</span> to extend loan guarantees to American companies interested in investing in Iraq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few, though, expect the legislation to proceed before next year's parliamentary elections and the inevitable political bargaining that will follow, putting off significant reforms, and thus investment, for at least a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capital is cowardly,'' said Mejul Mahdi Ali, the president of Diyala's newly created investment commission. ''It is always looking for a safe place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he spoke, an explosion reverberated through Baquba; a roadside bomb killed three police officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ali complained that many government ministers showed little interest in foreign or private investment, or actively opposed it. The commission was kicked out of two government offices before moving to a shabby villa, equipped not by the provincial government, but the American reconstruction team at Forward Operating Base Warhorse, which is nearby. He has not been paid in three months, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The provincial government's idea of economic development, he said, is a plan to buy 10,000 taxis and lease them to drivers, against his advice. Baquba might soon be the easiest place in the world to catch a cab, but he said, ''That's not investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even with uncertain security and insufficient legal protections, Iraq has started attracting the attention of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Daimler AG</span> signed an agreement with Iraq last year and opened an office in Baghdad. Case New Holland, the international tractor maker, began building the first of 1,250 tractors for the Iraqi government at a factory in Iskandariya, once a center of the insurgency in an area south of Baghdad known as the ''triangle of death.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers broke ground in July on a high-end $100 million hotel near the ''crossed swords'' monument in Baghdad's international zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Potential investors have a virtual open landscape to develop projects that will fill the needs of Iraq's expanding and demanding population,'' Dr. Araji of the national investment commission wrote in an investors guide published this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism has been premature before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Industry last year solicited bids for more than 40 projects involving partnerships with state-owned enterprises, but received them for only 11. Most of those have since failed to come to fruition, including the $60 million proposal for the electrical company here in Baquba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plant, with eight separate factories, was originally built in 1982 and equipped with machines by Mitsubishi that are now out of date. They still function only because workers have cannibalized parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the war in Diyala was at its worst in 2007, the company shut down; the Islamic Army of Iraq, one of the leading insurgent factions, established its headquarters nearby. The director, Abdul Wadoud al-Sattar Mahmoud, went into hiding; his personal assistant was killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The violence ultimately eased, and the factory began to operate again, though largely with the help of the American reconstruction team at Warhorse and the Task Force for Business Stability Operations, a Pentagon agency that supports economic development in Iraq. The task force's function has been to restore production at Iraq's state-owned enterprises, after American officials initially sought to shut them immediately after the invasion in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by the task force in 2007 criticized the factory's management and described the factory's ''most insidious'' problem as ''a general lack of industriousness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government policies have not helped make it profitable either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ministry of Industry has vastly expanded its payroll to 3,400 workers, compared with 1,200 after the invasion, and raised salaries, driving up the costs of its products. At the same time, a decision by the Coalition Provisional Authority to lower customs duties has meant cheaper foreign products. The factory now has 12,000 unsold ceiling fans and one million spark plugs stored in its warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahmoud said that while one ministry drove up costs, another, the Ministry of Electricity, complained that it could buy cheaper transformers from abroad. ''The competition here is very difficult for me,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraqi law forbids foreign companies from owning equity in state-owned enterprises. The Ministry of Industry also forbids wholesale restructuring of companies that would require dismissing workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even worse, in the case of the factory here, when the Ministry of Industry initialed the $60 million investment deal with an Egyptian-Iraqi consortium last year, it suspended its subsidies for the steel needed to make electrical transformers, potentially its most lucrative product in a country starved for power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consortium, however, pulled out of the deal earlier this year -- because of the general international economic crisis, officials said -- and the supply of steel necessary to keep production going dwindled. The production line would have ground to a halt if the Americans had not stepped in with the grant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could produce more if we had raw materials,'' the line's manager, Abdul Salam Mohammed, said plaintively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The director, Mr. Mahmoud, has begun to personally lobby provincial governments for business, deeply discounting the transformers and worsening the company's losses, something he never had to do before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a new experience for us,'' he said.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would the financial system have gotten into the mess it did if all the banks in the United States operated like small lenders? President Obama doesn't seem to think so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He even recognized ''responsible lenders, including community banks, doing the right thing'' in his <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> anniversary speech. Leaders of big banks don't agree, of course. But the numbers, at least for the moment, bear out the president's thinking on the subject.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic crisis is still taking its toll on the banking industry. So it is too early to say for certain that small banks performed better than big banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a glance at some preliminary data for the first half of the year, culled for Breakingviews.com by SNL Financial, shows smaller banks beating their larger competitors on nearly every measure important to shareholders, customers and policy makers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As legislators consider ways to prevent another near collapse of the global financial system, they could do worse than analyze the performance divide between America's big and small commercial banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholder hot buttons include returns on assets and equity. In the second quarter, American banks with assets of more than $5 billion -- of which there are about 150, ranging from Ally Bank (formerly <span class="companylink">GMAC Bank</span>) to Zions Bank of Salt Lake City -- reported the profitability of their loans, expressed as a median return on average equity, at 3.15 percent. The return on equity of small banks was significantly higher, at 5.31 percent, in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This appears to show that the 7,300 banks that reported assets of less than $5 billion at the end of the first quarter, from 1st Bank Yuma of Arizona to Zavala County Bank in Crystal City, Tex., make loans with a better trade-off between risk and return than large banks do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net charge-offs, the debts a bank decides are uncollectible, stood at 0.20 percent of all loans for small banks. Big banks, by contrast, wrote down eight times that percentage of the loans on their books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a wrinkle. Small banks lent out a smaller percentage of their customers' deposits -- 83.11 percent in the second quarter, to be exact -- than the big banks, which converted 94.24 percent of deposits into loans, according to SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a meaningful difference. If all banks in the United States kept their loan-to-deposit ratios in line with smaller banks, some $830 billion less credit on total deposits of $7.54 trillion would reach American businesses and consumers than if all banks adopted the big banks' lending ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit is important to a smoothly functioning system, though of course it might not be such a bad thing if the dodgiest layer of today's borrowers couldn't get loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On balance, the data tend to support those who favor dismantling or shrinking huge institutions like <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, all of which actually increased market share during the financial panic by acquiring weakened and failed rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet while small banks have done better by many measures, the gap between them and the big players appears to be narrowing. For example, from the first quarter to the second, the difference between the return on assets at small and large banks shrank by nearly 20 percent. And uncollectable debts at small banks, while still far lower than at large ones, had doubled as a percentage of average loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be a sign that the loans small banks focus on, like those made to small businesses and real estate developers, tend to underperform later in an economic downturn than big corporate and consumer loans. But it's still hard to see the gaps between big and small banks disappearing completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's another benefit to fragmentation besides performance. While many of the largest lenders have, through the bailout policies of the last year, been officially designated too big to fail, no community bank represents a systemic risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president may be on to something in praising the merits of a financial system consisting of banks that might be called too small to bail. ROB COX</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe a large potential customer you have been chasing finally comes through with a huge order -- and then orders again and again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or many of your smaller clients fell away in the recent economic downturn.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the reason, when you examine where your revenue is coming from, you may discover that one or two customers are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of your sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger with that is obvious. Should they suddenly stop doing business with you, your company could suffer. Drastically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can you guard against this situation? Here are some pointers that could help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WARNING SIGNS The National Federation of Independent Business understands the appeal of attracting customers who have the ability to give you substantial sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the foundation for long-term growth and stability. When you have customers you can count on month after month, the secure cash flow gives the opportunity to consider expanding in new directions and tapping new markets,'' they write.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how do you know if a customer has become too important to you? The federation offers these two crucial warning signs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When one customer is responsible for 30 percent or more of your revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If cash flow would be badly disrupted if one customer were to suddenly cancel all orders or even cut back sharply. ''Expenses would continue, but suddenly there wouldn't be enough to cover them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PREVENTIVE MEASURES If you are in an industry where there are only a few major competitors, limiting your dependence on one company may be extremely difficult, Suzanne Caplan points out on Entrepreneur.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that case, you obviously need to watch the financial health of your customer very carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If payments get slower, take some action. If the company is big enough, the accounting side does not talk to the purchasing side, so you won't lose the business. Anyway, if you're not going to get paid, you don't want the sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLAN B One way to reduce the anxiety of losing a large customer is to prepare for it. In other words, you need a backup plan, Stephanie Migot writes on her blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recognize that unless you are supplying a unique product or service, the customer can readily go elsewhere. ''The trick, she says, ''is to be like a flirtatious paramour: make it clear that you are willing to work, but be clear that they are not your only prospect. It is perfectly acceptable to prioritize those customers who provide the best pay, or the most regular orders, but you need to take care not to neglect the customers who may provide less lucrative or frequent revenue streams. It's nice to feel needed, but it is also a very precarious position to be in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LESSON When it is comes to the potential mixed blessing of having one large customer, Rhonda Abrams, small-business consultant, sums up your options nicely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure, you have to serve that one big customer,'' she says. ''But while earning a good income from that one customer, you have two choices: grow your business and diversify your customer base or start putting away substantial sums of money in case that customer disappears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST CALL How can you tell if a big customer you have depended on is running into financial trouble? BasicJokes.com offers one -- hopefully tongue in cheek -- example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A customer sent an order to a distributor for a large amount of goods totaling a great deal of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The distributor noticed that the customer's previous bill hadn't been paid. The collections manager left a voice mail for them saying, 'We can't ship your new order until you pay for the last one.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next day the collections manager received a collect phone call, 'Please cancel the order. We can't wait that long.' ''</p>

Indeed, bars, restaurants and even small theme parks recreating motifs from the Showa era -- the period of the previous emperor's reign from 1926 to 1989 -- have popped up all over the country, serving retro beers and displaying posters of long-gone movie stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Japan had good times. We all worked hard, and companies only knew how to grow,'' said Atsushi Kachi, drink in hand at the Nippon Saisei Sakaba, a 1950s-era restaurant in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo that serves grilled meats and beers of the age. ''Back then, people believed their lives would get better,'' said Mr. Kachi, 59, who works for a trading company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese familiar with World War II and its disastrous aftermath have a different perspective. Japan may soon be eclipsed by China, said Masaru Mizuno, 77, a longtime bureaucrat who once ran <span class="companylink">Japan Tobacco</span>, one of Japan's largest companies. ''But it is not as if we will go back to an era of mass starvation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overall size of the economy does not matter. The lives of ordinary Japanese have so improved in the last few decades,'' Mr. Mizuno said. ''What is there to complain about?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. ROBERT HILLIER has been doing deals all his life, and whenever one falls short of his hopes, he always seems to have plenty of others to keep him busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2007, Mr. Hillier announced the $30 million merger of his Princeton, N.J., architectural firm with a Scottish conglomerate, RMJM, and shifted his entrepreneurial zeal to a Web site called Obit.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The content would be an eclectic mix of obituaries, essays, cartoons and profiles of active oldsters, he said at the time. He predicted the venture ''could become very big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recently asked Mr. Hillier, 72 years old, how things were going. Great, he said. He reminded me that the timing of the sale of his firm was ''perfect,'' coming just before the economic collapse. He went on to say that in January, he bought Princeton Magazine, which was being published in another county. He relocated the magazine to Princeton, he said, redesigned it, upgraded the content and has already increased advertising revenue by 40 percent. He predicted that circulation, now 34,000, would grow to 50,000 within five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been a home run,'' Mr. Hillier said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, he said, he left RMJM in July and started a design and development real estate venture called J. Robert Hillier. ''I decided to brand myself,'' he said. In its first six weeks, it has landed 12 projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what about Obit? It's doing ''O.K.,'' he said. It has won four Webby Awards, and the number of ''hits'' has risen to more than 100,000 a month. ''But the topic of death is still a hurdle for a lot of readers,'' he said. Winning over advertisers is not easy, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never mind all that. Mr. Hillier says he is also the majority owner of Princeton's 13,000-circulation free weekly community newspaper, Town Topics. He describes it as a ''gold mine,'' with a return of 26 percent in an ugly environment for most publications. And he teaches an architecture seminar at Princeton University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all about having fun,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is for us all. Writing this column for 2 1/2 years has been a great ride for me that ends in December. To say farewell, I decided to return to some of the entrepreneurs I have profiled to ask how their businesses have fared, and to tell their stories in a three-part series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recurring theme (no surprise here) was their struggle to make headway in the recession. Yet, while some are treading water or have thrown in the towel, others, like Mr. Hillier, have prospered -- in some cases, not in spite of but because of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Goldin, owner of AmeriMerchant, a New York financial services company whose successful legal battle with a rival was detailed here in August 2007, says that while his firm has been caught up in the economic turmoil, he expects it to emerge stronger than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in this decade, Mr. Goldin, 37, spent thousands of hours gathering evidence to show that AmeriMerchant, which advances cash to merchants in return for a portion of their future credit card receipts, did not violate a patent held by a Georgia company called <span class="companylink">AdvanceMe</span> on its method of doing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an appeal by <span class="companylink">AdvanceMe</span> was rejected last year by a federal court, he said, calls from private equity firms, hedge funds and other potential investors picked up markedly. But when the financial crisis deepened, his phones went silent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cope, Mr. Goldin persuaded lenders to maintain his credit lines while he cut costs, sharply reduced the bad debt on his books and switched his target from customers dependent on the housing industry to businesses that do well in recessions, like fast-food restaurants. He says his efforts have paid off: as other companies in his sector have failed, AmeriMerchant remains profitable, its staff is growing and revenue is gaining, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe many of our competitors waited too long to adjust and are too deep in bad debt to ever pull out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his optimism, Mr. Goldin says he sometimes wonders whether his choice of advancing unsecured working capital to small businesses was the right entrepreneurial choice. ''Maybe I should have my head checked,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Enos, the 33-year-old co-founder of StudyPoint in Boston, says the recession has taught him more lessons about business in 18 months than he had learned in the previous eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2007, Mr. Enos told me he wanted to ''build the nation's most successful private in-home tutoring services company.'' He was on a hiring binge. He projected a 66 percent growth in revenue the following year, and he had plans to increase StudyPoint's presence in other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He missed most of the targets, but he says he has not abandoned his goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today, things are looking up. Revenue, which declined in 2007 and 2008, now looks likely to grow by 25 percent this year, to $5.2 million. The company has moved into the black after two years of losses. He is hiring again and his staff, which had shrunk through attrition, is back to where it was two years ago, at 32. The company has expanded into 23 cities, from 10 in late 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Enos's strategy for maneuvering through hard times, he says, was to discard ancillary activities like teaching in schools and stick to his core business. He also credits his no-layoffs policy with raising morale and productivity. ''Every major company in our industry was letting people go except us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth Deming, who appeared in this column in April 2008 with the lament that her New Directions Support Group in Philadelphia for victims of depression and bipolar disorder was so cash-poor it was turning her into a ''penniless do-gooder,'' has also weathered the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to increasing rates to participants for attending meetings to $5, from $3, New Directions has been successful at winning grants, Ms. Deming, 63, said. Last month alone, it received $15,000 from the Patricia Kind Family Foundation and $3,500 from her county's health department. It also obtained a $2,500 gift to keep its twice-yearly magazine, The Compass, alive.''We're still going strong,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many federal contracting opportunities for small businesses, but to take advantage of them you have to know the ins and outs of the government's contracting rules and regulations. Of the more than 20 million small businesses in the United States, only about 500,000 are currently in a position to do business with the federal government. That's not because they are the only ones capable of doing the work; it's because they know how to get the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how big the opportunity is: small companies are eligible to bid on any size contract, but the government is required to reserve all federal purchases between $3,000 and $100,000 for small businesses -- unless the contracting officer can't get offers from two or more small businesses that are competitive on price, quality and delivery.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before you try to woo the federal government, you have to have a track record. The government usually won't give a contract to a business if it doesn't have positive cash flow and if it hasn't been in business for at least two years, said Bridget Bean, district director of the Small Business Administration's Washington metropolitan area office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration offers a host of programs like HUBZone and the 8(a) Business Development Program designed to help firms demonstrate their qualifications. It's not easy for a small firm to score a federal contract, Ms. Bean conceded: ''It takes someone who wants to do this and avail themselves of all of the resources. These opportunities are not handed to people.'' (To read an interview with a successful contractor, click here.) Once you have decided that you want to pursue a federal contract and that you are ready to take the plunge, here's a to-do list:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Select your North American Industry Classification System code -- better known as the NAICS code -- which is the standard used by federal statistical agencies to classify businesses for collecting and analyzing data related to the nation's business economy. There are a handful of private research firms that provide NAICS codes for specific companies, usually for a fee. For example, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Hoovers, Moody's Investors Service and IBISWorld all offer this service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Determine your small-business size standard based on your NAICS code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Register for a Dun &amp; BradstreetDUNS Code, a free nine-digit identifier that helps track businesses globally. Dun &amp; Bradstreet assigns DUNS numbers for each physical location of a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Register in the Central Contractor Registration database to do business with the federal government. Bear in mind that contracting officers go to the database to look for small businesses to fulfill contracting requirements. ''If you're not in there, contracting officers won't know you exist,'' Ms. Bean said. There are currently about 500,000 companies, including foreign businesses, registered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Complete an Online Representation and Certifications Application but note that you must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database before you do this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Sign up for FedBizOpps to receive notices of contract solicitations and requests for information. Small-business owners can customize the data they want to receive so that they will be notified only about contracts that their firms would be eligible to bid on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Visit the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Directors, known as OSDBU. Each federal agency has such an office, whose mission is to help give contracting dollars to small businesses. You can review the list of offices to find out contact information for the federal agency or agencies you've decided you would like to work with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Meet with an S.B.A. Procurement Center representative. The representatives review and evaluate federal agencies' small-business programs and assist small businesses in obtaining federal contracts and subcontracts. They also counsel small firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Meet with S.B.A. Resource Partners like Small Business Development Centers, SCORE and Women's Business Centers, all of which counsel and train on anything and everything small business, including government contracting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Contact your Local Procurement Technical Assistant Center (P.T.A.C.). These centers can help outline the requirements of government contracting and help you figure out how to obtain and execute federal, state and local government contracts. Some Small Business Development Centers are physically located with P.T.A.C.'s to help make the process easier for small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11. Contact your Regional Federal Executive Board. These boards are located in cities that are hubs of federal activity and are composed of federal field office agency heads and military commanders in those cities. The regional boards generally look out for the well-being of contractors there and conduct community relations, according to Guy Timberlake, chief executive of the American Small Business Coalition, a trade group based in Columbia, Md., that helps its members do business with the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12. Consider subcontracting and partnering. Research which companies in your industry have contracts and contact them to determine how your company can help fulfill their goals. Lourdes Martin-Rosa, <span class="companylink">American Express</span> OPEN adviser on government contracting, recommends that small concerns getting started with federal contracting partner with a larger firm on their first contracts to get a feel for the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">13. Decide which agencies to contact. Because there are thousands of federal departments, agencies and offices that offer small-business opportunities, it can be daunting to figure out where to start. Ms. Bean of the S.B.A. recommends choosing three agencies to focus on. ''There are a lot of federal agencies out there and within them are sub-agencies,'' she said. ''You need to hone your research and make sure that they buy your product or service.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Timberlake, of the American Small Business Coalition, said small-business owners might want to begin looking for contracts in their own backyard. Even if you don't live near Washington, there is probably a branch of a government agency within 20 to 50 miles of your location. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers is broken up into districts. Certain districts may focus on building dams while others focus on fighting forest fires. You can find a list of all agencies here. Ms. Bean also suggests finding out if the targeted agency hosts monthly outreach meetings to connect small businesses with their contracting officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever happens, don't get overconfident -- or discouraged. Many small firms are so excited when they win a contract that they put all of their attention on that one agreement and let other parts of their business slide. If you do secure a contract, ''you can rest on your laurels for one day,'' Ms. Bean said, but ''you have to be constantly marketing yourself, and these contracts aren't a permanent thing -- like funding could cease.'' She recommends that a small business begin marketing itself for other opportunities even when it has just been awarded a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even if your firm doesn't win, you have 10 days to seek mediation by a contracting official. The mediator is required to explain why the firm didn't win the contract, which can enhance your learning process. You may also be able to review the winning bidder's proposal. Occasionally, decisions are changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen during a mediation there was a mistake and that's why the contract wasn't awarded,'' Ms. Martin-Rosa said. ''The government thought something was a 9 and actually it was a 7.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick Tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Network. If you're selling acommunications tool that you believe will appeal to the military, for example, attend events held by a chapter of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think micro. Almost 300,000 government employees are authorized to make purchases that total as much as $3,000 through the SmartPay program. No contracts required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Know your acronyms. The government is rife with them, and the same acronym can mean different things to different agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your application is rejected, seek mediation. The mediator is required to explain within 10 days why you didn't get the contract.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EMPLOYMENT experts have some advice for the many Americans either looking for work or fearing they soon will be: Consider yourself an entrepreneur -- of your own working life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term entrepreneur is usually applied to people seeking to start their own small businesses. But those in the recruitment and employment industry say the uncertainty in the current economy means that workers need to think of their careers as their own small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lesson of today is that you're working for yourself,'' said Janice Bryant Howroyd, the founder and chief executive of Act 1 Personnel Services, a staffing and employment company. ''Most people say they're giving their lives to the company, but it's more of a cooperative process. Companies have tasks to perform and you must put in your best effort and identify yourself with that job,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment experts say they see a complex picture of changing job patterns as employers respond to hard times, global competition and fresh opportunities. So as companies and organizations are forced to be more innovative, they say, so must employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Jonassen, head of Jim Jonassen &amp; Associates Venture Search, noted the explosion of online employment sites and social media that have transformed the marketplace in recent years. ''You used to be scared your boss would see your resume on Monster.com,'' he said. ''But today your boss's resume is on LinkedIn along with your own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Howroyd is an entrepreneur in the traditional sense. She said she left Tarboro, N.C., in 1976 to work for a brother-in-law's talent agency in Los Angeles and two years later started her own small employment firm. At the beginning, she said, she played off the fact that ''I was a minority-owned business in two ways, as an African-American and a woman.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the years, Act 1 has grown past its original role as an employment agency. One division, Agile 1, for instance, supplies and, in some cases, employs people for other businesses. One of its clients is <span class="companylink">MetLife</span>, the giant insurance company. Jeffrey Hebert, strategic sourcing consultant at <span class="companylink">MetLife</span>, explained: ''An operation may need a new person but not have the budget to hire this year. So we get somebody from an agency like Act 1, which handles that individual's payroll and benefits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While flexibility helps businesses, it means that workers are not insulated from hard times and insecurity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jonassen, who has founded half a dozen software and personnel companies over two decades, said he and his latest firm suffered a dry period starting in the fall of 2008 when the high-technology start-ups that he recruits for stopped hiring and began laying off people. ''The venture capital outfits that backed them had ordered these entrepreneurs to stop following their visionary plans and cut back to where they could make a small profit, by doing research for others in digital technology and other routine work,'' Mr. Jonassen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said, ''In July of this year, demand picked up for computer and mobile phone applications, and these entrepreneurs found they had cut too much.'' Now, he said, they are scrambling to hire skilled people, and his recruiting business is thriving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joy Chen followed her own entrepreneurial career path. Ms. Chen, with a master's degree in business administration from the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, had been a deputy mayor of Los Angeles and then went to work for <span class="companylink">Heidrick &amp; Struggles</span>, the management search firm. She left to start her own recruiting firm, Chen Partners in 2007, just as the economy started to slow. Business was initially scarce, she said. ''Many employers were even then hunkering down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then this year, Ms. Chen said, things changed. ''Many companies noticed that after all the layoffs and uncertainty, skilled people were available at lower salary demands than in former years. And now business is very active.'' The lesson of the economy's ups and downs, she said, is that workers cannot let hard times or lower pay discourage them. ''It's a change in the market, not a depreciation of who you are as a person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Howroyd, whose Act 1 Group has grown in recent years as businesses have experimented with assembling staffs from a mix of full- and part-time employees, said she had noticed the same increase in demand. ''We are growing this year,'' Ms. Howroyd said, because ''employers now recognize that they must decide how best to manage staffing, whether with independent contractors, temporary or full-time employees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Howroyd said temporary work used to be seen as a dead end but that that was not necessarily true anymore. ''In the recent market, we see companies taking people on temporarily or as contract workers who could become full time when conditions improve,'' she said. ''It's more flexible today and that's smart, rather than hiring people on and then letting them go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caris Diagnostics</span> of Phoenix, which is also a client of Act 1, is a molecular testing company that employs cell biologists and skilled lab technicians. It does not routinely hire short-term help but occasionally needs to fulfill a special project, said Wendy Brown, the company's human resources manager. ''So we contract for as many as 40 scientists for limited periods.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists working as contract labor, part time, as needed -- the old model of permanent positions and fixed employment has changed profoundly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And workplaces will continue to do so, Mr. Jonassen predicted, because ''recessions like this spawn entrepreneurs.'' In the downturn of aerospace-defense industries in the early '90s, he recalled, ''many people had to rethink careers and become entrepreneurs.'' Today, because companies can be formed cheaply thanks to cloud computing and mobile communications, he said, ''I think we'll see a new surge of entrepreneurs.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When property taxes go up, homeowners can find other homeowners willing to fight for relief. Big businesses, too, can flex their muscles. But small businesses are often left behind, mainly because they are, well, small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The little guys get hurt more by rate hikes because they have less bargaining power with their local city governments or taxing jurisdictions,'' said Myron Orfield, a University of Minnesota Law School professor and property tax specialist.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Hoene, director of research and policy for the National League of Cities, an association in Washington said that the property tax problem of some small-business owners was ''a story that isn't told often enough, even though it closely approximates the one that we tell about homeowners on fixed incomes who can't afford their property taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With tax revenue down, said Robert J. Cline, director of state and local tax policy economics for the Ernst &amp; Young accounting firm, all businesses face potential property tax rate increases. But property taxes represent a greater portion of the total tax bill for small businesses, Mr. Cline said. ''So if property tax rates rise significantly, small businesses may see that this recession has a more severe impact on them in terms of taxes compared to the 2001 recession, when property values held up like a champ,'' making rate increases unnecessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the 2001 recession, there were ''residential property tax revolts'' in a number of states, including Florida and Indiana, said Gerald Prante, an economist for the Tax Foundation, a tax policy group in Washington. ''In many respects, homeowners got what they wanted, and as a result there was a shift in some municipalities to higher property taxes for businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grafton Willey IV, a tax accountant who heads the Rhode Island chapter of the National Small Business Association, an advocacy group based in Washington, said that while homeowners carried much of the property tax burden, ''they vote, and often push politicians to put more of it on businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan M. Wachter, a real estate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, noted that large retailers could push their rent costs down throughout America's malls. ''Large malls will follow through with requesting lowered property tax from municipalities,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''Small entrepreneurs and tenants do not have similar information resources to even know whether and how much property tax payments are being lowered for others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Orfield said that municipalities with the least property wealth -- central cities and older ''inner-ring'' suburbs where foreclosures had weakened an already fragile tax base -- were the most compelled to raise rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In many big metro areas, where hundreds of surrounding cities have competed for property wealth by zoning for the biggest housing and most valuable commercial property, it's a disaster,'' he said. ''Twenty percent got all the good jobs and big homes, which allows them to have lower tax rates. The rest got nothing -- and a small-business person there, who probably has one location where he needs to do business, will be hurt when rates go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Scully, an organizer for Building One America and the Gamaliel Foundation, community grass-roots groups based in Chicago, said that rising tax rates had been ''devastating for owners of one-off small businesses like hardware stores, barbershops and bookstores.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Tax Foundation, using the latest available Census Bureau data, New Jersey collected the nation's highest per-capita combined local and state property tax, $2,485, in 2007. Connecticut, where -- as in New Jersey and most other states -- local schools depend heavily on local property tax dollars, placed second with $2,312; New York was sixth with $1,963. Alabama collected the least, $455.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond greater state financing for schools, property tax relief generally takes two forms, said Mr. Hoene of the National League of Cities -- so-called circuit breakers, which limit increases for homeowners on fixed incomes, and one-size-fits-all caps on rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caps -- including those under California's trend-setting Proposition 13, approved by voters in 1978 -- come off when a property is sold. Mr. Hoene said most of the benefits of caps eventually flow to ventures that change hands infrequently, like apartment buildings, and big businesses that can move property under their corporate umbrella.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caps can also have unintended consequences, like California's recent increases in state income and sales taxes or reductions in local services that small businesses need. And entrepreneurs operating on narrow profit margins get no circuit breakers, Mr. Hoene said. ''We think about relief for homeowners on fixed incomes, but rarely consider those most at risk on the commercial side.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bloomfield, N.J., Kelly Conklin and his wife, Kathryn Schackner, own Foley-Waite Associates, a 31-year-old architectural woodworking company that produces interiors for high-end Manhattan residences. The company employs nine full-time workers with benefits and rents space in a former 19th-century knitting mill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under his lease, Mr. Conklin pays his landlords' property taxes, which he expects will soon rise $100 to $200 a month. That is not a lot of money, Mr. Conklin said, ''But this is not a business of having your throat cut by one expense -- it's a death of a thousand cuts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''All our costs are up. We're now working our way through a backlog of orders, but given the financial meltdown in Manhattan and the attendant decline in real estate values, there's a cliff out there with our name on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Conklin has a unique perspective on property taxes. He sits on the planning board of Glen Ridge, the next town over, where he and his wife live. While unhappy about his tax increase, he is deeply worried that Bloomfield's interest in far greater revenue may lead to his losing his space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A developer has bought the adjacent industrial parcel, and I know he has discussed a development scheme for multiunit housing with Bloomfield officials,'' Mr. Conklin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If he pursues the idea, he may well succeed in getting the parcel rezoned -- multiunit housing yields significantly more property tax revenue than an old mill,'' Mr. Conklin said. ''And if that happens, I'm worried that he may then give our landlords an offer for the mill that is too attractive for them to refuse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''It's hard to run a business with this much uncertainty, on top of everything else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polly Cleveland, a land economist who teaches environmental economics at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, said there were ''an awful lot of people in Mr. Conklin's position'' because local services were overly dependent on local property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is nothing wrong with the property tax,'' said Ms. Cleveland, herself an entrepreneur who with her husband, Thomas Haines, last paid property taxes of about $190,000 on two small Manhattan apartment buildings they recently sold. ''It is actually the most progressive tax that we have when we administer it properly and finance services such as health and education at the state level.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After enduring months of criticism that his administration had done too little to help small businesses weather the recession, President Obama said Wednesday that ''there's still too little credit flowing to our small businesses'' and unveiled initiatives he said would open the spigot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measures, announced by Mr. Obama at a small records storage company in Maryland, would allow smaller community banks to borrow at low rates from the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program. It would also raise the loan caps on several popular Small Business Administration programs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the administration plan, banks with less than $1 billion in assets could borrow from the program at a lower interest rate than financial institutions are required to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In exchange, banks must demonstrate how they would increase lending to small businesses and follow up with quarterly reports. According to the White House, most business loans by the community banks that are eligible for the new rules are made to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, community groups that lend to small businesses in low-income areas under a Treasury Department program will be able to borrow relief money at just 2 percent annually for eight years. In the past, banks have been leery of the such loans because the program allows the government to buy warrants for the banks' common stock and because it requires the institutions to limit executive compensation. But the small banks probably will not have to issue warrants in that program rules contain an exception for infusions of less than $100 million. The proposal as described Wednesday caps the infusions at $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small institutions would be subject to the same compensation rules as any other relief recipient, said Gene Sperling, senior counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in an interview. But, he added, ''for these smaller community banks, the executive bonus restrictions will usually affect only their single most highly compensated employee.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some community bankers remain concerned. ''I think that could be a damper on community bank involvement in this program, said Cam Fine, president and chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade association. ''Those family-owned banks are not going to want to subject themselves to compensation restrictions imposed by TARP, because it is their own personal money that is the capital of the bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing the S.B.A. loan limits will require approval from Congress. The administration's plans, which would raise the limit on the most popular loan to $5 million from $2 million, are identical to provisions of a bill introduced by Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. She is the ranking Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee and is seen as perhaps the only Republican who may vote for a Democratic-led health care bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Ms. Snowe indicated she appreciated the gesture. ''These actions will help satisfy the capital needs of small businesses looking to start or expand their operations,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the S.B.A. proposals, the bailout plan can take effect at the administration's direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is to conduct a wide spread consultation with the small business and small bank community for a few weeks, and get this operational as quickly as is practical,'' Mr. Sperling said.</p>

That stood in stark contrast to the countries using the euro, where reports showed steadily improving activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A significant reason for the divergent performance appears to be the larger debt burden of British consumers, analysts said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary report from the Office of National Statistics in London showed that gross domestic product contracted by 0.4 percent from July through September from the previous three months, and it shrank by 5.2 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British economy has now shrunk for six successive quarters, making this the longest downturn since the agency started tracking such data in 1955.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected growth of 0.2 percent for the quarter, based on recent improvements in housing statistics, purchasing managers' indexes and the wilting pound, which should make exports more competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report showed weakness in the service sector, where output fell 0.2 percent; industrial production, down 0.7 percent; and construction, off 1.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain is starting to further lag behind the 16-member euro area, where France and Germany are leading steady improvements in manufacturing, services and consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean-Michel Six, chief European economist at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, cited consumer indebtedness as the main factor undermining a recovery in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''U.K. consumers are coming out of a period of very significant leveraging, and the process of unwinding that is long and painful,'' he said. ''You would expect savings rates to grow and credit demand to fall, weighing on the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, German business confidence in October rose to its highest level in 13 months, according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its business climate index, which surveys 7,000 executives, rose to 91.9, from 91.3 in September. The index touched a recent low of 82.2 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The third quarter was a good quarter for the German economy,'' said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING. ''Probably even an excellent quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said German companies were benefiting from the pickup in global activity, stock rebuilding, stimulus-driven private consumption and tax relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, from the data firm Markit, showed that a composite index of manufacturing and services industries in the euro area improved to 53 in October, from 51.1 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading was the highest in 22 months, Markit said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said the data indicated that the euro-zone economy had entered the fourth quarter on a strong note and were consistent with gross domestic product rising at a quarterly rate of around 0.4 percent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, the national statistics office, Insee, said that consumer spending jumped 2.3 percent in September from August, well above expectations of a 0.5 percent rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another release Friday, from the European Union data agency Eurostat, showed that industrial orders in the euro area increased by 2 percent in August from July, but were down 23.1 percent from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance brokers and benefits consultants say their small business clients are seeing premiums go up an average of about 15 percent for the coming year -- double the rate of last year's increases. That would mean an annual premium that was $4,500 per employee in 2008 and $4,800 this year would rise to $5,500 in 2010.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher premiums at least partly reflect the inexorable rise of medical costs, which is forcing Medicare to raise premiums, too. Health insurance bills are also rising for big employers, but because they have more negotiating clout, their increases are generally not as steep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher medical costs aside, some experts say they think the insurance industry, under pressure from Wall Street, is raising premiums to get ahead of any legislative changes that might reduce their profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases come at a politically fraught time for the insurers, as they try to fight off the creation of a government-run competitor and as they push their case that they have a central role to play in controlling the nation's health care costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama, in his Saturday radio address, said the Democrats' health insurance overhaul would help small businesses and stimulate the economy by providing relief from ''the crushing costs of health care -- costs that have forced too many small businesses to cut benefits, shed jobs, or shut their doors for good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insurance industry has already been under sharp attack by Democratic lawmakers who favor creating a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers. Without that competition, proponents say, insurers will continue to price coverage beyond the reach of many Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses, which employ about 40 percent of the private labor force, are a big constituency for both parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said the sharp rise in premiums for small businesses offered the latest evidence that Congress must act swiftly on health care legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This underlines the urgent need for health insurance reform, including a public option,'' she said in an interview. ''We need to have competition for the insurance companies to keep premiums down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers say there is no need for a government-run insurance plan and argue that their health plans are already responsible for many of the initiatives, like programs to coordinate care for chronic conditions, that ultimately lower costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers' ''profits are not responsible for increased health care costs,'' said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the industry's trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the insurers, Republican lawmakers, who portray themselves as champions of small business, argue that the proposed legislation would raise premiums across the board because sick people would be more likely to enroll than healthy people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also say the taxes and other ways of paying for the program would be passed on to employers in higher premiums, only making matters worse for small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said in a response to the president's radio address, ''We can't support a bill that will raise premiums.'' The big insurance companies declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With negotiations over next year's premiums still under way, data on rate increases are mostly anecdotal. Formal surveys have not yet been completed by the health benefits consultants who track the figures. And in some parts of the country, experts say rates are not overly high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But benefits consultants say there is no doubt that premiums are soaring for many small businesses. Edward Kaplan, a consultant with the <span class="companylink">Segal Company</span>, said his clients were seeing renewals for coverage at prices 15 to 23 percent higher this year. Last year, he said, they typically faced increases of 7 to 12 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokers and consultants say the price jumps seem hard to justify. ''Frankly, I'm mystified by the size of the increases,'' said one broker, Charles J. Newman, who works with small employers in the New York area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say the threat of an overhaul may be at least part of the reason. Joshua Miley, a consultant with HighRoads, which analyzes benefit information for employers, said the ''undercurrent of health reform is driving part of the renewal increases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HighRoads projects that premiums will rise 14.4 percent for an individual in a health maintenance organization plan at a typical small employer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no question that insurers are under pressure from Wall Street. In recent years, insurers were often not quick enough to raise their premiums well above the rising cost of medical care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they have heard from angry investors disappointed by the companies' earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no one out there who hasn't had to do a mea culpa to Wall Street,'' said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst for Pali Capital who follows the companies. While the industry is particularly vulnerable now in Washington, she said, ''it seems like they're more afraid of Wall Street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael A. Turpin, a former senior executive for <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth</span>, the insurer, and now a top official at USI Holdings, an insurance brokerage firm, said insurers were now ''under so much pressure to post earnings, they're going to make hay while the sun is shining.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with many Republican lawmakers, the insurers say the current Congressional proposals do too little to address the underlying reasons for high premiums -- the unabated rise in medical costs and effects of a weak economy. Hospitals, for example, have been treating greater numbers of people who have lost their jobs and their insurance, and they are passing along some of those costs by charging higher prices to private insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry also points to low government payments to hospitals and doctors, which insurers say result in higher prices for employer-based coverage to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis released two weeks ago by America's Health Insurance Plans, insurers said premiums would rise even faster under the legislation under study in Congress -- an assessment fiercely disputed by Democratic Congressional leaders and some health care economists but shared by many Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses, besides having less negotiating leverage than big employers, tend to pay more for the same coverage because they cannot spread the cost of expensive medical conditions or hospitalizations over large numbers of workers. Premiums can be especially high if they have sick or older workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of small companies say the lack of options is why they have been paying increasingly higher premiums for less and less coverage -- this year perhaps more than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, when Walter Rowen, who owns Susquehanna Glass in Columbia, Pa., sought to renew his company's coverage for two dozen employees, he said his insurer demanded a 160 percent rate increase. Mr. Rowen said he was told his work force was ''getting too old and very expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rowen said his insurance broker found that any other health plan was likely to charge 30 to 50 percent more than he paid last year. He chose a less generous plan from a different carrier for 44 percent more.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, President Obamaannounced new initiatives to spur lending to small businesses, including higher caps on loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. The Obama administration acted after enduring months of criticism from small-business advocates, some of whom say the measures are too little too late. In an interview, the S.B.A. administrator, Karen Mills, spoke about this and other efforts by the Obama administration -- including her assertion that the agency is currently well ahead of its goal of making sure that at least 23 percent of government contracts go to small businesses. A condensed version of the conversation follows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. In light of the way S.B.A. lending fell so dramatically last year, has the recession taught us anything about what the S.B.A. can do?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think we've learned that the S.B.A. plays a critical role in providing access and opportunity when the market is not providing that access. We help banks get that money out into the hands of important and viable businesses, particularly those owned by minorities, women, immigrants and veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. But when the market collapsed, so did S.B.A. lending. Is there a better way to do it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. This has been a pretty strong system, and strong success story, and partnering with 5,000 banks is, I think, a highly effective template. We should build on the strength of our partnerships because it gives more points of access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What reaction have you gotten to the president's proposals to increase access to S.B.A. lending?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We've gotten tremendous support. Everybody now understands how critical it is to help small businesses get out of this recession and into recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. There are a lot of small businesses that are in no position to take on more debt. What can the S.B.A. offer them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Among our responsibilities is to make sure that 23 percent of all government contracts go to small businesses. That's about $150 billion annually, from all the government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Well, since you brought it up: the S.B.A. reported a couple of months back that in 2008, the government didn't meet that 23 percent goal. Of course, that was before your time. But what are you going to do to push that number up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I have to give the vice president credit. [Commerce Secretary] Gary Locke and I were tasked by the vice president with making sure that the Recovery Act dollars met the same small-business goals that we have for the regular money. It was actually not in the statute, but we took it on as if it were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first thing we did is with Commerce we held 200 matchmaking events, where we bring agencies in to meet suppliers. We did 200 of these in 90 days. We also put training guides up on the Web site. In the first weeks, 10,000 people have taken the course on how to get a government contract -- they haven't just clicked on the page, they've taken the course. We're trying to provide small businesses more seamless access to these business opportunities, and then walk them through it. And this is a big engine, because the president and the vice president and the other agencies have bought in that this is a win-win. Our goal is 23 percent and we're at 26.5 percent. We're double the goal on small disadvantaged businesses. We're going to get there on those women-owned businesses, but we're above on all the other goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Let's talk about health care. A lot of people who purport to speak for small businesses object strenuously to an employer mandate. Do you think an employer taking some, or even most, of the responsibility for providing health care for its employees is bad for small business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. When the [National Federation of Independent Business] surveys small businesses, affordable health care is the No. 1 concern -- out of 77 issues. It has been since 1986. Why are they saying that? They're saying that because small-business owners want to provide health care. It's like a family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been traveling the country pretty rigorously over the last four months, talking in every stop to small-business owners about health care. I have to tell you a story. Kathleen Sebelius and I are in New Jersey, doing a panel in a factory with women business owners. And one of them -- and I'll never forget this -- says, ''Look, I started this business, and we were three years before we could provide health care. The day we got that policy, I said, 'My business is a success.' '' That's what's going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. So if health care were more affordable, you wouldn't need a mandate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think the No. 1 concern that these small businesses have is that we provide things like the exchange. That's what they care about. They want the choice and competition. That's the outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I noticed you didn't mention the public option. The Congressional Budget Office has said that a government-run insurance plan competing with private coverage could reduce premium costs by up to 10 percent on top of the savings you'd get with an exchange. If cost is the problem, why isn't the public option a rallying cry for small business? Why aren't you out there pushing for it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, once again, I think small businesses are focusing on the outcome that they want. There are many paths being discussed in the process, but those are the outcomes small business cares about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. There seems to be a lot of pent-up frustration from small-business owners directed at government in general and the Obama administration in particular. In your travels, do you see that? Do you think there's hope for turning that around?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We see tremendous excitement from small-business people about the administration and about the attention and commitment that the president has to do things that really make a difference. I think they recognize that health care is one of those. I think they recognize that what we've been doing in the Recovery Act with our loan programs has mattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did you see the end of his speech [last week]? I'm standing behind him in the warehouse, with all the boxes. He finishes the prepared remarks, and he says something else, which I knew was not in the prepared remarks. I'll read it to you. He says: ''So to all the small-business owners out there, I just want to close by saying this. I know that times are tough, and I can only imagine what many of you are going through in terms of keeping things going in the midst of a very tough economic climate, but I guarantee you this: This administration is going to stand behind small businesses. You are our highest priority because we are confident that when you are succeeding, America succeeds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was not in the script. That's what he thinks. That's what I think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. And you think that message is being received?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I do.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country may be seeing a light at the end of the tunnel that isn't another oncoming train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the government said that the nation's gross domestic product, which had been shrinking in the last year, grew by 3.5 percent for the quarter that ended in September. Durable goods orders were up 22.3 percent at an annual rate, housing sales rose 23.4 percent, and in an economic indicator closer to home, there was a contractor in my house on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession may not be over over, especially if you count jobs, but many people may be willing to spend again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you might expect the business press to be striking up the band and restocking the cigar cabinet. Instead, Forbes, a magazine that sells a beau ideal of capitalism, announced last week that it was cutting a quarter of its already decimated staff. The Wall Street Journal's Boston bureau -- historically a hothouse of game-changing business coverage -- is being closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortune magazine had already cut back to 18 issues a year from 25 and this week will be whacking anew at staff along with other <span class="companylink">Time Inc</span>. magazines. BusinessWeek was sold for parts to Bloomberg a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, while the business of business may be back, the business of covering it with heroic narratives and upbeat glossy spreads most certainly is not. And probably never will be. There are several technical reasons underlying the collapse -- and that's what it is -- of business journalism. Business wisdom that is imprisoned in printed pages, already locked in the past, increasingly seems like a curio. Who cares what happened yesterday or last week, when the fortunes of a stock can change in millisecond? Most business people already know what happened today, and what they really care about is tomorrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the challenges of covering business in a digital age, the endemic categories of advertising including financial services, insurance and consulting services, and vaporized ad budgets from Detroit, have left once-fat chronicles of the business epoch bereft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't just that Cadillacs aren't selling like they used to. It's also that the people who made them, bought them and drove them seem far more mortal and less interesting than they did just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business magazines used to relish explaining all the complex new financial instruments that Wall Street was using to pile up profits. But now it has become clear that the titans who were wielding those obscure tools had no idea what they were doing -- even less an idea than the journalists in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the fact that they needed billions and billions in taxpayer money to bail them out has left the former Masters of the Universe with all the social cachet of welfare recipients. In fact, people on welfare seem more deserving now that some of the rescued have come roaring back just in time for year-end bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business journalism loves epic scale, but if you want to read a magazine about the biggest player in the financial industry or the auto industry, best pick up an issue of Governing or Congressional Quarterly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much ink was spilled over the years about how business would take off if only government would get out of the way, but now all the salient conversation is on increased regulation and oversight. And bureaucrats in full frolic will never be an editorial match for guys who leave the office in helicopters to reach houses that should have their own ZIP code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the public has lost its appetite for stories about handsome men in three-piece suits who clink whiskey glasses at the end of a long, not-so-hard day while talking smack about their female co-workers. But ''Mad Men'' pretty much sates that need. The businessman as Colossus is by now a nostalgic impulse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we see a close-up of Crockett &amp; Jones lace-ups, we realize that they often are inhabited by manifest feet of clay and find ourselves wondering whether the taxpayers paid for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just business that has changed, it is the idea of business. For decades, it was the best minds that American business schools produced, along with bootstrapping savants, crossing swords with the invisible hand and coming away winners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the consequences are removed from the equation and the feds are there to cushion any downside, riding the upside seems less magical. Writers and editors who cover business now know that the jig is up, that those bespoke suits are put on one leg at a time by men that seem far less Olympian than they once did. Even Warren Buffett, the oracle of both business and Omaha, has gotten pushed around by an economy full of trap doors, unforeseen consequences and head feints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exceptions. <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Apple. Twitter (assuming it ever makes money). But the editorial tropes of financial might don't easily describe the nature of their accomplishment. How hot and bothered is a reader supposed to get about an algorithm? And no one wants to read a magazine about the sovereign funds, foreign investors and bargain hunters from afar who seem to be the real power in buying in at the bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business coverage has been, at its heart, aspirational, a brand promise that suggests that if you clip the right articles, internalize the right rhetoric, then you too will end up as one of the shiny, happy people striding boldly across the pages of magazines with names like Fortune, Money, Fast Company and Wired. But nobody is going to read, let alone aspire to, magazines called Middled, Outsourced, Left Behind and Clobbered. It's as if American business has lost custody of its own story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exuberance, irrational and otherwise, will most likely return at some point, just as it always has. But people could be forgiven for not believing in business, or business news, the way they used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a recovery is under way, most Average Joes are not buying in or benefiting so far. On Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending actually dropped in September, the first time it had gone down in five months, and the Dow buckled 2.5 percent at the end of trading last week. Consumers clearly lack confidence in the recovery, and, by extension, the people who are supposed to make it happen. And doubt doesn't sell magazines.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Chester, Pa. -- THE Great Recession is over. The solid 3.5 percent gain in gross domestic product during the third quarter proves that the longest, broadest and most severe American downturn since the 1930s has finally given way to recovery. It is no accident that the recession ended just as Washington's fiscal stimulus program began providing its maximum impetus to the economy. If the financial crisis had been allowed to continue unchecked by aggressive government action, we would not yet have reached a turning point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recovery remains fragile. No doubt, there will be moments in the coming months when the economy appears liable to falter again. In order to ensure that today's tentative recovery becomes a lasting expansion, the government must now make it a priority to deal with employment -- particularly among small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses are especially vital to job growth. Establishments with fewer than 20 employees account for 25 percent of all jobs, but these same-sized companies generated 40 percent of the job growth in the last economic expansion, from 2003 to 2007. In their recent efforts to recharge the economy, policy makers have all but forgotten small business, finding it both easier and more visible to help large multinational firms. Unfortunately, though, big business can't provide the jobs needed to power the economy forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses may not be shedding jobs as aggressively as they were earlier this year, but they still aren't hiring. Unless they start doing so soon, consumers won't have the wherewithal to keep spending, and the economy could slip back into recession. A cycle of falling wages and prices would likely begin, adding to the danger and giving the Fed and Congress fewer options and resources to respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is conceivable that businesses will resume hiring soon. Employment growth historically lags a pickup in gross domestic product. But firms typically increase production by first increasing workers' hours and adding temporary help. Neither has happened so far: working hours remain stuck at a record low of 33 hours a week, and the number of temporary jobs is still in decline (nearly a million have been lost in the past three years).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small firms are now struggling to obtain credit; their principal lenders, small banks, are under intense pressure, and hundreds more are set to be taken over by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>. Credit card lenders, another key source of loans to small business, have aggressively raised their underwriting standards. Policy makers could offer quick relief by empowering the Small Business Administration to provide more credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration guarantees bank loans to small businesses, but banks aren't making very many because the loan's interest rates are capped at less than 6 percent -- not enough to compensate for their risks at a time when business bankruptcies are high and rising. Creditworthy small firms would gladly pay somewhat higher rates to obtain credit. Increasing the maximum size of an S.B.A. loan and temporarily raising the percentage of the loan guarantees to as high as 97.5 percent, from 90 percent, would also prompt much more lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help small companies with cash flow, policy makers should also extend provisions in the current stimulus bill that allow money-losing firms to receive refunds of taxes paid on profits earned in previous years. (In return, they agree to pay higher taxes in the future.) Rules permitting such refunds are scheduled to expire at the end of this year; an extension through next year would provide quick cash for many firms that might otherwise be forced to close. Given the tens of thousands of bankruptcies in the works by businesses of all sizes, expanding this tax benefit to bigger firms than are now permitted in the stimulus package would be a plus. Allowing companies with as many as 250 employees to take advantage of the benefit could potentially help well more than a quarter-million firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the government could help minimize the number of new job losses by promoting work-share programs. Nothing damages morale at a company more than layoffs; the experience not only is crushing for those who lose their jobs, but also weighs on those who remain, including managers. Layoffs are also costly, given severance expenses and the costs of rehiring or training new employees when business picks up again. Seventeen states offer effective work-share programs. Under these arrangements, employers cut workers' hours -- not their jobs -- and states make up a portion of workers' lost wages with unemployment insurance payments. Congress should provide financing to expand such programs nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These policy steps would not be free, but they could be surprisingly economical. Most of the credit and cash provided by taxpayers up front would come back; loans would be repaid and businesses that are given tax refunds would pay higher taxes on their future profits. This kind of help from Washington could help sustain the new signs of recovery and firmly put the recession behind us.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of Tuesday's election, the top two mayoral candidates put aside their bitter arguments over term limits, campaign spending and the city's schools to try to reassure voters about a more pressing worry: the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the unemployment rate at a 16-year high, tens of thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure and the city's budget deficit topping $5 billion, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered strikingly different messages to an unsettled electorate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson, the Democrat, described two New Yorks. One, he said, was for people like Mr. Bloomberg: the superrich Manhattanites and Wall Street titans. The other was for hardworking wage-earners and small business owners who, he said, were being endlessly taxed and driven out of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have a mayor who has stood up and fought for us,'' Mr. Thompson told a group of artists in Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the election ''is about whether we go down the same path where we push people out of the city, or do we go down a different path and for the first time in years put somebody on the side of those who work each and every single day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg, during a tour of the five boroughs, dropped in on small businesses and greeted commuters, stressing his financial acumen and background as a businessman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged the troubled economy -- ''it has big problems'' -- but did not seem eager to dwell on it, instead emphasizing the stories of small businesses that have thrived: ''We're trying to help small businesses that need loans, give them advice on how to structure a loan application, or how to deal with city government, trying to reduce taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At each stop, the mayor, who founded the giant financial data firm that bears his name, dispensed C.E.O.-knows-best advice to business owners. ''The answer for small business, really,'' he said, ''is to find something unique -- unique may be being in the neighborhood, unique may be customizing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described his early days building up his business, <span class="companylink">Bloomberg L.P</span>., after getting fired from Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You get up every day with the thrill of doing something new, but you also go to bed at night with a sort of knot in your stomach saying, 'I wonder if I'm going to get through,' and most do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economic pains crept into his day, sometimes in poignant, unscripted ways. After buying some pastries at Holtermann's Bakery on Staten Island, the mayor was stopped by a man on the street who had fallen on hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mayor Bloomberg, with all due respect, I'm ready to go bankrupt,'' the man said. The mayor politely cut him off, saying, ''All I can do is try to help you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the mayor's healthy lead in the polls, the surveys show a big divide among voters along income lines. A Marist poll released on Friday showed that among registered voters, wealthier respondents overwhelmingly support Mr. Bloomberg, while the race is essentially tied among those who make less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another gap exists among the boroughs; people in Manhattan and Queens strongly favor the mayor, while Mr. Thompson runs close with him in the Bronx and Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some neighborhoods, resentment over Mr. Bloomberg's spending on the race has intensified the sense of economic imbalance. The mayor is on track to spend more than $100 million to be re-elected, and some residents say his nonstop advertisements and mailings serve as reminders of how distant he is from their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He should put that money into the community,'' said Lobsang Perez, 30, a fashion industry worker in Washington Heights, who stood on a street corner with his friends, complaining that that the only development in the neighborhood consisted of condominiums for the rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a return to the economic theme, Mr. Bloomberg seemed to quietly remind New Yorkers of his reason for seeking a third term: that his financial expertise was required to guide the city through an extraordinary time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an argument that he offered with less and less frequency as the campaign wore on, in part to distance himself from his unpopular flip-flop on term limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't hear the economic savior argument anymore, do you?'' said City Councilman John C. Liu, the Democratic nominee for comptroller who is expected to coast to election on Tuesday. He has endorsed Mr. Thompson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start of his mayoral run, Mr. Thompson has tried to summon populist rage over the city's battered economy, but it has at times felt like a secondary theme in a campaign built around anger over term limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, however, the economy took center stage in his remarks, and he sought to portray Mr. Bloomberg, and his policies, as out of touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to end this focus on just Wall Street and big business, and focus again on small businesses in New York,'' Mr. Thompson said. He was short on solutions, but he lashed out at the mayor for the city's high unemployment rate. ''It is a crisis. We need jobs across the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He criticized the city's practice, under Mr. Bloomberg, of blanketing neighborhoods with parking tickets and saddling businesses with fines over small infractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York City is at war with its small businesses,'' he said. ''That needs to end today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg appeared attuned to the criticism, rattling off his record of assisting small businesses and placing thousands of New Yorkers in jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are the future of our city,'' he said in Brooklyn. ''I have friends who could easily move their businesses elsewhere, but what they tell me is the quality of the work here is better.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Center for Women's Business Research was founded nearly two decades ago by a group of women seeking to win respect for businesses run by women. But even center officials were surprised by the findings in their own report: that those businesses play a significant role in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which was released last month, estimated that eight million businesses -- or 28 percent of all businesses -- were owned by women, and that those businesses created or maintained 16 percent of all jobs in a range of industries like business services, personal services, retail, health care, communications and real estate.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Impressive,'' said Gwen Martin, the center's interim executive director. ''It was something many of us knew intuitively. For the first time, we said, 'We're going to figure out how to quantify it.' I think everyone was pleasantly surprised with the results.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Martin said, ''As good as it is, it also points out how much better it could be.'' Only 4.2 percent of all revenue is generated by businesses owned by women in the United States, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with the new research, center officials and other women business leaders are approaching the Obama administration, the Small Business Administration and House and Senate small-business committee members to ask for more resources and new programs to support women-owned businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Barton, executive director of the National Women's Business Council, a bipartisan federal advisory group that helped pay for the research, will be doing the same thing. ''It certainly strengthens our hand,'' Ms. Barton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've never done a study like this before,'' Ms. Barton said of the report, which was also underwritten by <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span>. ''We'd seen anecdotally about the number of women entrepreneurs. This is a confirmation of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic impact report, Ms. Barton said, offers ''recognition on the Hill and in the marketplace that women are doing much more than holding baby-sitting jobs, or proofreading papers or knitting macrame wall hangings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she acknowledged, ''it's the glass half full,'' citing a finding in the report that only 20 percent of women-owned businesses had employees. She said she would like to see those numbers increase. ''We see that as an area of great growth and opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin agreed that that should be a priority. Most private and public programs focus on starting a business, she said. While those programs are still important, she said, ''we need to really teach how to grow a business,'' which requires different skills and motivations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Women really have to fall in love with running a business,'' she said. ''They have to move in to the stage about being excited and motivated by running a business. We need help with that area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letty Hudson, president of Chicago Mini Bus Travel, is a prime example of the owner these groups are trying to spur on. She recently attended a meeting of Women Impacting Public Policy, a national bipartisan nonprofit group, trying to find ways to increase her business activity, which is down this year. While participants learned of the research on women and business, Ms. Hudson was able to share her own experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She spoke of how she had created an ''inner circle'' group of five people whose mission was to make strategic contacts, and of how successful the group had been. ''It's a new way of doing business,'' Ms. Hudson said. ''Let's help each other. Look at our own history and go back and connect people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After she finished, a participant at her table asked her to run a national bus tour. That happened, she said, ''just from me sitting there explaining how we can connect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Business as usual has changed,'' she said. Relationships are now the key, she said. ''This is the new wave on how we change the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hudson runs a business that produces revenue of more than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barton, of the business council, said that she and others were particularly concerned about helping the ''missing middle,'' the majority of business owners who struggle to push annual revenue past $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to continue to look at that point on the spectrum,'' she said. ''We do well starting them out and encourage them at the top with mentoring, but it's the missing middle we need to help nourish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1999, Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence, a nonprofit organization founded by Nell Merlino, who created the Take Our Daughters to Work campaign, has concentrated its efforts on helping businesses owned by women grow. Count Me In runs a program called Make Mine a Million $ Business, which attracts hundreds of businesses each year hoping to reach the $1 million revenue threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third quarter, the leader board -- the program is a yearlong race -- showed that revenue for the top 25 businesses had grown 30 percent from a year earlier and that employment, along with the use of contract workers, had increased 86 percent, Ms. Merlino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in this tough climate, she said, these women are moving forward. ''This tells me that for all the focus the administration has on getting money moving, it is important, but it is not the only thing. It's got to be more about the middle -- it's where the jobs come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason most business don't grow, but particularly women, is they try to do everything themselves,'' Ms. Merlino said. ''Here you have this economic calamity -- the most important thing to do is to hire people.'' With 10 million out of work, she added, there is an extraordinary labor pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colette Chapman, president of Chapman Concierge, based in Morristown, N.J., which works with corporations and residential management companies to provide services to employees and residents, took advantage of that talent this year, hiring a former chief financial officer and a former equities trader. ''Two years ago, I would never found that caliber of employees,'' Ms. Chapman said. ''They would never have consider doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has been good for her in other ways as well, she said, as overworked clients have taken advantage of her residential and corporate concierge services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She joined the Make Mine a Million challenge this year at the $344,000 revenue mark, hoping to raise that to $450,000 or higher. ''I set the bar high,'' Ms. Chapman said. ''We'll be very, very close.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Thursday about increasing attention being paid by charities to individual donors misspelled the surname of the executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation. He is David Saltzman, not Salzman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Nov 13 2009 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER years in the shadows, the everyday donor is emerging as philanthropy's newest hero, the driver of a more down-to-earth approach to charity. Sure, Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, Bono and other celebrity mega-donors still have their place, but now high-profile charities are homing in on smaller donations, while new charities are being organized around the principle of modest giving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of those all-hands-on-deck moments where we absolutely need to engage everyone, whether they are able to give 50 cents or $50 million,'' said David Salzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, famous for annual benefits where billionaires routinely hand over $20 million.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have always been generous givers, and small donations have always played their part. After a tsunami devastated parts of southeast Asia in 2004, individuals in the United States donated $2.78 billion of the $6.2 billion raised for relief efforts -- and the median gift was $50, the average gift $135. Yet multimillion gifts and lavish campaigns and events often commandeered the spotlight and the press coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are deluded by the attention paid to the large contributors in our country,'' said Wendy Smith, author of ''Give A Little: How Your Small Donations Can Transform the World.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small checks coming through the mail are the bread and butter for most organizations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From leaving a can of soup on the doorstep for collection by a local charity to logging on to the Internet and making a mini- or micro-gift, the small givers are drawing attention for their good works and their willingness to keep giving in a tough economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Robin Hood, a charity founded and supported by hedge fund tycoons and Hollywood celebrities, Mr. Salzman said the organization was for the first time working to attract young professionals whose pay is closer to $30,000 than to the nine-figure incomes of its founders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade association representing nonprofits and foundations, said many charitable organizations were ''making an effort to diversify their funding bases and not depend on a few large funders, whether they be foundations or individuals.'' For those organizations comfortable with technology, she said, ''this is not hard to do; but for others, it will take rethinking the way they fund raise altogether, including the professionals they use to help them raise money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One charitable organization that always recognized the value of the small donor is the March of Dimes, which gets about 22 percent of its revenue from gifts averaging $14. ''We are, indeed, the house the dime built,'' said Dr. Jennifer Howse, its chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of those gifts come from direct-mail efforts, though more and more from the Internet and social media, she said. The March of Dimes also relies on supermarket checkout lines, where at many stores shoppers can add a $1 donation to their purchase. At Kmart stores alone, this raised $6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gifts of $10, $15 and $20 can buy supplies for our research labs, books for a baby's nursery, a bundle of 15 brochures on healthy pregnancy to put in Medicaid clinics,'' Dr. Howse said. ''They really are valuable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new charitable endeavors thinking small is One Can a Week. Peter Norback asked his neighbors in Tucson to put a can of food on their doorsteps every Sunday and would collect them and deliver the food to the Tucson Community Food Bank, which like most other soup kitchens has seen a sharp increase in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did 10 houses the first week, the next week, those 10 plus 10 more,'' Mr. Norback said. ''I built it by tens. It took me months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 140 households in the neighborhood now participate, and through Sept. 30, they contributed more than 6,500 pounds of food and $1,262 in cash, or enough to feed more than 1,500 people three meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, One Day's Wages, a new charity established by Eugene Cho, a Christian minister in Seattle, asks donors to give up a day's income to charity. The idea came to Mr. Cho during a trip to Myanmar a few years ago when he visited a school in the jungle whose teachers were taking better-paying jobs in bordering Thailand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He asked a village elder what it would take to retain teachers, and they said about $40 each. Not a week. Not a month. ''I realized he meant per year,'' said Mr. Cho. ''It hit me: $40 can make a huge difference.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group, Fight Global Poverty, and pledged to donate $1 for each member who joined, up to a total of $100,000. The group now has more than 1 million members, and Mr. Cho and his wife will contribute about $68,000 this year -- representing a year's wages -- and the rest next year. One Day's Wages received tax-exempt status in May and started its Web site last month at www.onedayswages.org[http://www.onedayswages.org]. ''It's easy to be drawn to the multimillion-dollar donations, but we're doing ourselves a disservice by not elevating the stories of the working mothers and fathers who also contribute what are significant amounts to them,'' Mr. Cho said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GlobalGiving, another online fund-raising organization, supports very small projects proposed by nonprofits typically seeking less than $1,000. It has raised $22 million since it started in 2002, with an average gift of $54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are many Americans whose first interaction with giving, if not through a church or synagogue, is through an educational institution, normally as part of some big capital campaign that is trying to raise $100 million,'' said Margaret Coughlin, GlobalGiving's chief marketing officer. ''It makes you feel like an ant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GlobalGiving holds contests for organizations seeking a spot on its Web site. In a recent contest for nonprofits working internationally, ZimKids managed to raise $26,726 to educate and house orphans in Zimbabwe. The average gift was $240, but many were smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They had been looking for that $5,000 donor, the person who would give $10,000, but they participated in the global challenge to see how they'd do,'' Ms. Coughlin said. ''When it was over, the founders told us that the $25 and $50 gifts that had been made were the difference between being able to take care of 160 kids and not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even big philanthropists can speak the message of smallness. ''Just $2, that's all it takes'' to buy enough vaccine to give a poor child a much better chance of living to the age of 18, Bill Gates once said. While the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is known for its grants in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, it recently introduced the Living Proof Project, intended to demonstrate the impact American investments in global health could have at a granular level -- how for mere cents, critical nutrients can be added to baladi bread in Egypt or to the diets of mothers tutored in the value of breast milk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small grants have produced some of the biggest successes in foundation history, including the $96,691 that the Ford Foundation gave Mohammed Yunus to create the <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span> and lead the way in microfinancing. Mr. Yunus and the bank received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Ford, which gives away hundreds of millions of dollars a year, has been criticized for making too many small grants, but it has steadfastly stuck to that strategy as and more foundations moved to give money away in larger chunks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Making relatively small grants is really fundamental to the way we work, because over many, many years of experience, we have found that many ideas start small,'' said Suzanne Siskel, director of social justice philanthropy at Ford. ''What we do, then, is take a risk on a completely new idea that, if successful, we help grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Wall Street is recognizing the power of small. <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span>, which manages one of the largest pools of the charitable-giving accounts known as donor-advised funds, used to require that any donation from these funds be at least $100. In October 2008, it dropped the minimum to $50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to help donors use their account balances to give to as many causes as they had been accustomed to in the fat years, and if that meant reducing the minimum grant requirement, we were happy to do it,'' said Sarah C. Libbey, president of the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund. ''Small gifts do matter, especially when they are channeled and consolidated.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of businesses are making <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> an indispensible part of hanging out their shingles. Small businesses are using it to find new customers, build online communities of fans and dig into gold mines of demographic information.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need to be where your customers are and your prospective customers are,'' said Clara Shih, author of ''The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Era'' (Pearson Education, 2009). ''And with 300 million people on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and still growing, that's increasingly where your audience is for a lot of products and services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start Small</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most businesses, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Pages (distinct from individual profiles and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> groups) are the best place to start. Pages allow businesses to collect ''fans'' the way celebrities, sports teams, musicians and politicians do. There are now 1.4 million <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Pages and they collect more than 10 million fans every day, according to the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses can easily create a Web presence with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, even if they don't have their own Web site (most companies still should maintain a Web site to reach people who don't use <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or whose employers block access to the site). Businesses can claim a vanity address so that their <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> address reflects the business name, like www.facebook.com/Starbucks[http://www.facebook.com/Starbucks]. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> pages can link to the company's Web site or direct sales to e-commerce sites like <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span> or Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> offers an array of tools and networks, and it's easy to wander down too many paths. Ms. Shih recommends that newcomers start by asking themselves a simple question: What is your basic objective? Is it getting more customers in the door? Building brand awareness? Creating a venue for customer support? Once you have set your goal, you can strategize accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can waste a lot of time on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>,'' said Ms. Shih, founder of Hearsay Labs, a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> marketing software company. ''But if you're a business, you don't have any time to waste. Figure out your objectives first, start small and do things that help you accomplish your objectives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shih suggests that businesses ask friends and family to become fans of their pages so that they display a respectable crowd of supporters when they debut. Pages can grow organically by word of mouth -- the average <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> user has 130 friends on the site -- or by advertising or promotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can enliven your page with photos, comments and useful information. As you grow more comfortable, you can add videos or business applications. Flaunt your personality. The page of an ice cream parlor should feel different than that of a funeral parlor. ''The pages that are most successful,'' said Tim Kendall, the director of monetization at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, ''are the ones that really replicate the personality of the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's Not All About Selling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art Meets Commerce, a New York marketing firm, has struck up a never-ending conversation with fans. The company uses <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> as a crucial part of its publicity campaigns for theatrical productions. Its <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page for the show ''Rock of Ages,'' for example, has more than 13,000 fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff members constantly update the page with new photos, videos and quotes from the cast. They've also learned what not to do: Once they posted a video of Paris Hilton plugging the show and got negative feedback from fans who professed to be sick of her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not just about marketing -- or, at least, it's not just about selling. ''You end up moving away from being an Internet marketer and go into almost customer service,'' said Jim Glaub, creative director at the agency. ''A lot of times people use <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to ask questions: What's the student rush? How long is the show? Where's parking? You have to answer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some basic rules: Buy-buy-buy messages won't fly. The best practitioners make <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> less about selling and more about interacting. Engage with fans and critics. Listen to what people are saying, good and bad. You may even pick up ideas for how to improve your business. Keep content fresh. Use status updates and newsfeeds to tell fans about specials, events, contests or anything of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These interactions can take a vast amount of time -- the ''Rock of Ages'' page has 300 to 600 interactions every week -- but they can also provide a big payoff. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is one of the show's top sources of new ticket sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Art Meets Commerce introduced a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ad campaign to promote an Off Broadway run of the musical ''Fela!'' The campaign aimed at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users with interests like theatrical shows or Afro beat. According to the company, it generated 18 million impressions, more than 5,700 clicks and $40,000 in ticket sales -- all for $4,400 spent on advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can advertise all day, but if we don't give them what they want they will not be a fan anymore,'' said Mark Seeley, a marketing associate at Art Meets Commerce. ''Even though we represent the shows as marketers, we don't want to constantly tell people to buy tickets. You talk to them like you talk to your friends on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aim at Potential Customers Only</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some guys use <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to find single women. Chris Meyer used it to find women who are already engaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meyer, a wedding photographer in Woodbury, Minn., had had little luck with traditional advertising. A full-page ad in a bridal magazine generated zero leads and a trade show yielded only four bookings, barely covering the cost of his booth. But <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> proved a digital bonanza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meyer aimed at women ages 22 to 28 who listed their martial status as engaged in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. He estimates that he has spent about $300 on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ads in the last two years and has generated more than $60,000 in business. He says about three-quarters of his clients now come to him through <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, either from ads or recommendations from friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd be out of business if I didn't have <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''Especially with this economy, I need to stretch each marketing dollar as much as I possibly can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span> enables small businesses to engage in targeted marketing that they only could have dreamed about a few years ago. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users fill out profiles with information like hometown, employer, religious beliefs, interests, education and favorite books, movies and TV shows -- all of which can help advertisers deliver messages to specific demographic slices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you create an ad, you can add demographic criteria and keywords and see how many <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> users fall into your target audience and modify it accordingly to get the most bang for your buck. Advertisers can elect to pay per impression or per click, set maximum budgets and schedule the ad to run on specific dates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus a coffee shop in San Francisco can display advertisements only to local people whose profiles or group affiliations suggest they like coffee. According to Mr. Kendall, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s director of monetization, ads can also aim at people based on social exchanges, like a person who sends a message to a friend, ''let's get together for coffee'' or who posts a status update about just having awakened and needing some java.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can help you find customers before they even think about searching for you,'' Mr. Kendall said. ''We're very, very well-positioned to generate demand, based on the fact that we know a tremendous amount about a user.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ad system provides instant feedback with metrics like the number of impressions and clicks-through. This reporting allows Mr. Meyer to improve his advertising; if one ad doesn't generate enough hits within 24 hours, he pulls it and tries something new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Give Away Cupcakes!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Nelson has an M.B.A. and is a former investment banker who owns a growing national chain of stores. Yet this 40-year-old entrepreneur checks <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> with the frequency of a college student. Up to 30 times a day, he logs onto the social networking site via his laptop or Blackberry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Nelson, this is serious business. He and his wife, Candace, own Sprinkles, a cupcake bakery that relies on social media in lieu of traditional advertising. Mr. Nelson considers <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> marketing essential. ''People are out there talking about your business everyday, whether you're looking or not,'' he said. ''This gives people a place to come and speak directly to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sprinkles uses <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to give customers a whiff of what's cooking. Every day it posts a password on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> that can be redeemed for a free cupcake. Since April, its fan base has risen tenfold to 70,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nelson and his wife previously worked as investment bankers in the technology sector and were keenly aware that, even for a traditional business like a bakery, social media is a crucial ingredient. His advice: make it relevant to the customer, keep it fresh and remember that the return on investment may come slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Be patient with it,'' Mr. Nelson advised. ''People are not going to flock to your social media site overnight. Technology is about the network effect. It takes time for those connections to build.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A program intended to help disabled veterans win government business awarded at least $100 million in contracts to firms that were either ineligible or committed fraud to obtain the work, a federal review has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one case, a Nevada firm won a $7.5 million contract from the Federal Emergency Management Agency even though its majority owner was not a disabled veteran, the review by the Government Accountability Office said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two other cases, businesses that won contracts were owned by disabled veterans who were also full-time state government employees, making them ineligible. And in at least three other cases, companies owned by disabled veterans did little or none of the contracted work, simply passing it on to subcontractors not owned by disabled veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report concludes that the program lacks procedures to verify that applicant businesses are owned by disabled veterans. And even when fraud is uncovered, usually as a result of protests from competing companies, punishment is rarely meted out, allowing guilty firms to continue receiving federal contracts, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is scheduled to be released on Thursday in time for a hearing on the disabled veterans program before the House Committee on Small Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a Democrat from New York who is chairwoman of the committee, said, ''Fraud in this program means that honest veterans who own a small business lose out on projects to impostors who, in many cases, aren't small businesses or even veterans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration, which oversees the program, declined to comment on the report. But in a letter to the accountability office, an agency official asserted that problems with screening applicants and monitoring fraud were the responsibility of the federal agencies that issue the contracts, not the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The S.B.A. is only authorized to perform eligibility reviews in a protest situation,'' the official, Joseph G. Jordan, wrote. ''In this area, the S.B.A. believes it has been diligent and responsible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Ms. Velazquez and the accountability office disputed that, saying that federal rules authorize the Small Business Administration to administer the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For these kinds of procurement issues, the Small Business Administration has the appropriate expertise,'' Ms. Velazquez said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program, created in 2003, permits federal agencies to set aside a portion of their no-bid or sole-source contracts for small businesses owned by disabled veterans. The rules require that veterans who were disabled during active-duty service not only be majority owners, but also manage and control daily business operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress set a goal of having 3 percent of all federal contract dollars go to small businesses owned by disabled veterans, though that benchmark has not been reached. In 2007, $4 billion in federal contracts were awarded to firms owned by disabled veterans, about 1 percent of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review focused on 10 cases where fraud or abuse could be documented; none of the companies were named.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accountability office recommended that Congress enact rules that punish firms that win contracts through fraud, whether through levying fines, suspending contracts or barring them from receiving future contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, no such penalties are in place, the report said. In one case cited, a company based in Nevada fraudulently described itself as owned by a disabled veteran so it could compete for contracts to maintain trailers for hurricane victims in Louisiana. Yet after the fraud was uncovered, the company was not required to repay $7.5 million it had received, and has not been prohibited from receiving future contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another case, the accountability office found evidence that a veteran-owned business was a shell company for another firm that actually did the work, involving septic tank service at Army posts. Among other things, the investigators found that the disabled owner worked three days a week at his brother's bar and lived 1,800 miles from the California job site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company that apparently created the shell business has been allowed to continue doing work on a $1.1 million Army contract, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also calls for a centralized program to certify disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Currently only the Department of Veterans Affairs has a database of firms that are verified to be owned by disabled veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that database is used only by Veterans Affairs for its own contracts; other agencies allow small businesses to ''self certify'' that they are owned and controlled by disabled veterans. The report recommends that the database be expanded and made available to all federal agencies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How have they done it? Turns out, in a bad economy, successful small businesses tend to be successful in their own ways. In some cases, for example, the secret lies in offering customers more bang for the buck, and in others, it is in expanding overseas. The bottom line: for each company, the solution depends on a variety of factors, like business model and the industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The answers are very specific to the company's circumstances,'' said Ken Gaebler, chairman and chief executive of Gaebler Ventures, a business incubator and investment firm in Chicago. ''A good entrepreneur knows which buttons need to be pressed to thrive in a tough situation and make it through to the other side.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Princess Jenkins, the owner of the Brownstone, a New York City clothing and accessories boutique. Based on Harlem's bustling 125th Street, it has two employees and sells unusual fashions for women 40 and older. Last fall, Ms. Jenkins surveyed the market and realized how difficult the next season could be. She met with her five top designers and urged them to produce the boldest fashions they were capable of -- designs she knew would appeal to her customers' flamboyant tastes. ''I told them, it's going to get really tight next year,'' she said, ''and I need the best you have to offer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also mapped out a bigger marketing plan focused on three major events. In February, Ms. Jenkins rented a ballroom next door and staged her first fashion show, to which she invited 200 top clients. Sales from the event, she said, were ''incredible.'' Six months later, using decorations, curtains and designs from the show, Ms. Jenkins set up four booths -- she usually books just one -- during a small-business fair held as part of ''Harlem week.'' And, in early November, during the marathon, using three of those booths, she held another fashion show, this one with a D.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next time people come to 125th Street, they'll remember there was something big going on there,'' she said. ''It's all about building a lasting impression.'' According to Ms. Jenkins, the moves have paid off with year-to-year sales up about 10 percent. She expects them to total about $350,000 for 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other companies, the secret has been tightening expenses to make prices lower. In January, Travis Harris spun off his cellphone accessories business in Ephrata, Pa., from New Covenant Software, his software development firm, founded seven years ago. For one thing, the spun-off company, which Mr. Harris named TheCellGuru.com, begun two years ago and which has four employees, had been growing much faster than the original business. Plus, the two companies had very different business models. ''It was easier to handle them as separate corporations,'' Mr. Harris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he said he usually sold his products at about 10 percent less than competitors did, Mr. Harris decided to reduce his marketing budget and cut prices even further. He eliminated all of his paid advertising on the Web, choosing instead pay-per-click sites like <span class="companylink">Google</span> Products, through which customers can shop by comparing prices. Mr. Harris was able to pass his savings on to customers, lowering prices by $2 to $3 an item and increasing traffic 200 percent. Year-to-year sales, according to Mr. Harris, have also grown by that amount. ''We knew people were searching deeper, looking for the best prices they could find,'' he said. ''And when they discovered us, they'd say, 'O.K., this is it.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Inside Sports and Entertainment, Ety Rybak, a founder, and his partner concluded that the difficult climate called for a significant change in the type of events the 14-employee company organized. The company, based in New York and started five years ago, usually provided deluxe packages to the Super Bowl, Master's Cup and other major events, which clients used to reward employees or curry favor with their own customers, often spending $10,000 a person. But, last fall, Mr. Rybak realized that his ''clients couldn't possibly spend the kind of money they used to spend. We had to get creative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rybak decided to focus on local extravaganzas that didn't require paying for airfare or hotels -- organizing, for example, a number of large events during the openings of the new Yankee and Citi Field baseball stadiums in April. Another example: For a law firm, he put together a day at the Central Park Zoo, to which clients, employees and their families were invited. Usually, the firm held separate events for each constituency. Alan Baum, president of the company, estimates that revenue will be up about 25 percent this year, to more than $13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before last fall's crash, sales at Lexington International, a 12-employee maker of a laser device for treating hair loss, started heading south. ''People cut down on nonessential health care items, and we really felt it,'' said David Michaels, managing director of the company, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., and was founded nine years ago. When he analyzed his company's performance, Mr. Michaels concluded that the possibilities for domestic sales growth were slim. But he had started exporting his product, called HairMax, to Canada and Australia in 2001. Perhaps expanding to other countries was the answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Michaels turned to the Gold Key Service of the Commerce Department, hiring consultants who spent several months conducting industry research and visiting a handful of countries, the better to pinpoint potential distribution partners. Then, Mr. Michaels traveled to those places to meet his partners in person. At the same time, the consultants helped him understand the regulatory issues he would have to tackle in each country. Ultimately, the licensing process took three to nine months, depending on the region. The most difficult country was South Korea, which, Mr. Michaels said, has a particularly rigorous licensing procedure for medical devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he is also selling to Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, in addition to South Korea, where, Mr. Michaels said, ''There are significant social advantages to having a great head of hair.'' He figures that international sales have more than compensated for the decline in the United States.</p>

I worked in the family business from the time I was a toddler running around parking lots picking up discarded cups and utensils. Later I helped prepare food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schoolwork came first, but almost every Saturday a parent would drive me to an eight-hour day at our store in Ashland, Mass. In middle school, I received my first lesson in take-home pay: my check was less than the $3.50 an hour I thought I was making. My father explained that Social Security and taxes were being taken out of my pay. He said the government took what it needed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I graduated from Colby College in Waterville, Me., and was accepted to law and business schools. In my junior year at Colby, I heard Donald M. Kendall, then C.E.O. of <span class="companylink">PepsiCo</span>, talk at a seminar in Florida about influencing consumer behavior. His talk, and my father as a role model, influenced me to choose business school. I went to Cornell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By my second year, I was vice chairman of the marketing club. We brought executives of consumer packaged goods companies to campus to talk to the group. Many would stay an extra day to interview students for jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I arranged for an executive from Frito-Lay to speak. At the end of the reception, he said, ''I see your name isn't on my interview schedule tomorrow.'' I told him that moving to Texas, where Frito-Lay was based, had little appeal. He asked me to stop by the next afternoon. I showed up in a T-shirt and jeans and he handed me a plane ticket to Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I flew down and was amazed at the brands and enamored by the lifestyle. I came back to Ithaca, N.Y., with a 10-gallon hat. After graduation, I packed everything I owned into two suitcases and arrived in Dallas in 105-degree heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was home on vacation in 1986 when I was contacted by an acquaintance at Cadbury Confections in Stamford, Conn. It was building a new marketing department. I knew Frito-Lay would be successful with or without me. I was intrigued with the idea that I was going to make a difference as an individual rather than through a process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After starting in Cadbury's confection division, I transferred to the beverage division. I was a vice president of marketing by the time I was 30. Cadbury often sent younger senior management talent to headquarters in London for a year, then assigned it to other global sites. I was intrigued with going to headquarters from a professional perspective, but not from a personal one. There was no guarantee of returning to the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, at 36, I joined Welch's in Concord, Mass., as a vice president of marketing. I was there six years when I was contacted in 2000 by a mutual friend of the new C.E.O. of Ocean Spray, which, like Welch's, is a grower-owned cooperative. I became the chief operating officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the cranberry supply was growing as demand was flattening. The price of cranberries bought by Ocean Spray dropped from $60.45 a barrel in 1996 to $12.98 in 1999. But cranberries cost roughly $18 to $20 a barrel to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2004, about half the growers wanted to participate in a joint venture with <span class="companylink">PepsiCo</span>, to broaden product distribution. The others, including me, thought we could reinvigorate the company ourselves. We took the debate on the road. Many growers were in awe of <span class="companylink">PepsiCo</span>'s capabilities. In Oregon, my position was taunted. But companywide, the growers voted 52 to 48 percent to maintain the cooperative. (In 2006, we entered an agreement with Pepsi for it to bottle and distribute our single-serving cranberry juice products.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2004, we had had four C.E.O.'s in five years. I became interim C.E.O. in 2003 and was formally appointed to the post in 2004. Since I arrived, the company has developed products like Craisins dried cranberries; Cranergy, an energy drink; and white cranberry juice. This year, we're projecting the cranberry crop's price at $64 a barrel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here are also worried about the future. They fret that Bangalore, and India more broadly, will remain a low-cost satellite office of the West for the foreseeable future -- more Scranton, Pa., in the American television series ''The Office,'' than Silicon Valley.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the rest of the world has come to admire, envy and fear India's outsourcing business and its technological prowess, many Indians are disappointed that the country has not quickly moved up to more ambitious and lucrative work from answering phones or writing software. Why, they worry, hasn't India produced a <span class="companylink">Google</span> or an Apple?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation is hard to measure, but academics who study it say India has the potential to create trend-setting products but is not yet doing so. Indians are granted about half as many American patents for inventions as people and firms in Israel and China. The country's corporate and government spending on research and development significantly lags behind that of other nations. And venture capitalists finance far fewer companies here than they do elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The same idea, if it's born in Silicon Valley it goes the distance,'' said Nadathur S. Raghavan, a investor in start-ups and a founder of Infosys, one of India's most successful technology companies. ''If it's born in India it does not go the distance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Raghavan and others say India is held back by a financial system that is reluctant to invest in unproven ideas, an education system that emphasizes rote learning over problem solving, and a culture that looks down on failure and unconventional career choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sujai Karampuri is an Indian entrepreneur who has struggled against many of these constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His Bangalore-based company, Sloka Telecom, has developed award-winning radio systems that are more flexible, smaller and less expensive than equipment used by phone companies today. Mobile phone companies and larger telecommunications equipment suppliers are buying and testing his products, but he has not been able to interest Indian venture capitalists. For the last five years he has run his firm on $1 million he raised from acquaintances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can only afford to trial with one customer at a time and that takes three months to materialize,'' said Mr. Karampuri, who has considered moving the company to the United States to be closer to venture capitalists who specialize in telecommunications. ''You are always worried about paying next month's salary to people. Should you keep the money for this trial or next month's salary?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like Sloka Telecom are important, analysts say, because they are more likely to create the next wave of jobs than large, established Indian technology companies, many of which are experiencing slower growth. These companies could also help offset some of the outsourcing jobs the country will likely lose because of greater automation and competition from countries where costs are even lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are historical reasons that starting a business in India is difficult. During British rule, imperial interests dictated economic activity; after independence in 1947, central planning stifled entrepreneurship through burdensome licensing and direct state ownership of companies and banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses found that currying favor with policy makers was more important than innovating. And import restrictions made it hard to acquire machinery, parts or technology. Inventors came up with ingenious ways to overcome obstacles and scarcity -- a talent Indians used the Hindi word ''jugaad'' (pronounced jewgard) to describe. But the products that resulted from such improvisation were often inferior to those available outside India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were in an economy where, forget innovation, expansion was discouraged, creating wealth was frowned upon, there was no competition to speak of,'' said Anand G. Mahindra, who heads the <span class="companylink">Mahindra &amp; Mahindra</span> business group and has spoken about the need for more innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian leaders began embracing the free market in the 1980s and stepped up the pace of change in 1991 when the country faced a financial crisis. Those changes increased economic growth and made possible the rise of technology companies like Infosys and Wipro, which focused on providing services for American and European corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the government still exerts significant control, especially in manufacturing, said Rishikesha T. Krishnan, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To start a services company it really takes you just two or three days to get going,'' said Mr. Krishnan, whose book, ''From Jugaad to Systematic Innovation: The Challenge for India,'' is to be published next year. ''The moment you are looking at manufacturing, there are hundreds of inspectors and regulations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising money is one of the biggest challenges entrepreneurs face. Venture capital funds have flocked to India in recent years, but they are more likely to invest in established businesses than young firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, Israel and elsewhere, the initial, or seed, capital for many start-ups comes from rich individuals known as angel investors. But most rich Indians prefer to invest with family members or close friends because its considered safer and provides assurance that the lender will be able to borrow from relatives in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to raise $3 to $4 million, it's doable,'' said Sumir Chadha, who co-heads Sequoia Capital's Indian operations. ''But it's difficult if you want to raise $300,000 or $400,000,'' a typical investment at the early stages of a company's life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Cellworks Group, which has most of its operations in Bangalore, was looking to raise money last year, executives talked to venture capitalists here and abroad. But the company raised all of the money it needed in the United States, because most local investors did not have the expertise to evaluate the biotech firm, said Taher Abbasi, the chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cellworks has planted its corporate headquarters and a small staff near San Jose so it can be close to investors and American universities for research collaboration on cancer drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To really kick off entrepreneurship without local money is very difficult,'' Mr. Abbasi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, India has its advantages. Engineers and biologists are plentiful, though they need to be trained more than their counterparts elsewhere. And operating costs are a lot lower than in the San Francisco Bay Area, which was critical more than two years ago when he and his partners started the company with their own money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may yet be hope for Indian innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are looking to fill the venture fund vacuum. A group called Mumbai Angels holds Saturday meetings every two months at which entrepreneurs pitch ideas to affluent investors. Members of the group have invested in about 20 companies, said Prashant Choksey, a co-founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, N. R. Narayana Murthy, the chairman of Infosys, recently sold $38 million worth of shares in his company to start a new venture capital fund. Mr. Raghavan, the former Infosys executive, has invested about $100 million in start-ups like Connexios Life Sciences, which is developing drugs to treat diabetes and other diseases. Many Indian universities have also started entrepreneurship programs and classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivek Wadhwa, a former technology entrepreneur who now researches innovation, said the climate for start-ups in India was a lot better than it was a few years ago. It should continue to improve, he said, in part because companies like <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> have hired tens of thousands of engineers in India to work in research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once they have been working on these projects for a few years they will outgrow the companies that they are working for,'' he said. ''They will hook up with these entrepreneurs that failed'' on previous start-up attempts and create new companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another change may augur well. Until early this decade, the Indian market was too small and isolated to make it very lucrative for businesses to develop products here, so most technology companies focused on selling services to the West, said Girish S. Paranjpe, joint chief executive of Wipro's information technology business. ''That will change dramatically because the Indian market has become bigger,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last eight years, the size of the Indian economy has roughly doubled along with the importance of foreign trade. There could still be something to envy and fear.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meeting with top executives from 12 financial institutions, Mr. Obama sent a clear message that the industry had a responsibility to help nurse the economy back to health and do more to create jobs in return for the huge federal bailout last year that kept Wall Street and the banking system afloat.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Obama also confronted the limits of his power to jawbone the industry as banking companies continued to repay government money received in the bailout. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, two of the biggest, announced on Monday that they were doing precisely that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the banks came hat in hand to Washington a year ago to assure their survival, they returned on Monday in a much stronger position to deal with the government. As they scurry to repay the government and escape its influence over their operations, they have been fighting elements of legislation to regulate their industry more tightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the banks are seeking to restore executive pay to high levels and asserting that the government's demand that they hold bigger financial buffers against possible losses makes it hard for them to issue more loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the hourlong meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Mr. Obama prodded the executives to stop fighting the regulation legislation intended to deal with the problems that led to the financial crisis, White House officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I made very clear that I have no intention of letting their lobbyists thwart reforms necessary to protect the American people,'' Mr. Obama said in remarks after the meeting. ''If they wish to fight common sense consumer protections, that's a fight I'm more than willing to have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heads of three of the biggest companies -- <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> -- did not even make it to the White House meeting in person. They had waited until Monday morning to travel on commercial flights to Washington and then were held up by fog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, James E. Rohr, <span class="companylink">PNC Financial</span>'s chief executive, drove his own car on Sunday evening to Washington from Pittsburgh, stopping at a Wendy's for a sandwich en route. Other chief executives made sure they would arrive on time: Jamie Dimon of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> flew into Washington on one of the bank's private jets, while Kenneth D. Chenault of <span class="companylink">American Express</span> took Amtrak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at the meeting said that Mr. Obama had told the missing three that he understood that their flight had been canceled. But he directed strong words at the industry afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''America's banks received extraordinary assistance from American taxpayers to rebuild their industry,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now that they're back on their feet, we expect an extraordinary commitment from them to help rebuild our economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''Ultimately in this country we rise and fall together; banks and small businesses, consumers and large corporations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the glare of the presidential spotlight, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> used the occasion to say it would increase lending to small and mid-size businesses by $5 billion next year over what it lent to them in 2009. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> announced a similar increase in early November and recently experienced an increase in new applications for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> said in a statement on Monday that it expected to increase lending in 2010 as much as 25 percent, to more than $16 billion, for firms with $20 million or less in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banking executives promised Mr. Obama that they would take second looks at loans they had denied over the last year. Richard K. Davis, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">US Bancorp</span>, told reporters after the meeting that the executives were aware of the public perception that they were profiting with hefty bonuses at taxpayer expense, and that they realized they were ''under a microscope'' and needed to align themselves more closely with the needs of consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he cautioned that banks had a responsibility to carefully evaluate the qualifications of each client, lest there be a repeat of the bad lending practices that contributed to the financial crisis to begin with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We simply want to assure that we make qualified loans,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials acknowledged that beyond the legislation on Capitol Hill, the administration's leverage to prod the bankers, particularly on lending, was limited. But Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Obama would keep up the public pressure. ''I think that the bully pulpit can be a powerful thing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In calling the bankers to the White House, Mr. Obama was seeking to capitalize on public anger over the continuation of big bonuses for Wall Street executives, coupled with the slow pace of renewed lending by institutions bailed out by taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Monday's meeting, Mr. Obama did not repeat the language he used in an interview on ''60 Minutes'' on CBS Sunday night, in which he termed the bank executives ''fat cats.'' During the meeting, ''he didn't call us any names,'' Mr. Davis said, adding that ''we agree viscerally that more lending needs to be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the unemployment rate at 10 percent, the White House needs to move the conversation from visceral to specific, administration officials said. Mr. Obama pressed the bankers to come up with possible solutions, according to administration officials and industry officials. In contrast to the lecturing tones of a similar meeting last March, several people in attendance Monday described this session as more constructive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were no pitchforks, no fat cat bankers,'' said Mr. Rohr of PNC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the chief executives, armed with statistics about initiatives to hire new bankers, replied that they were very focused on lending. Some, like Mr. Davis of <span class="companylink">US Bancorp</span>, raised ideas like giving a second look to previously denied loans. Others proposed cutting the red tape on Small Business Administration loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama will meet next week with representatives of smaller banks, where he is expected to sound similar tones.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pendulum might have swung too far in the direction of not lending,'' Mr. Obama told reporters after meeting with 12 bankers from across the country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we can get that balance right, there are businesses and communities out there that are ready to grow,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Obama met with the heads of the country's largest lenders after publicly castigating big bankers as fat cats, and earlier in December there was a White House jobs meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There remains enormous opportunities as we come out of this recession for businesses to start growing again and to start hiring again,'' Mr. Obama said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks contend that the collapse of the real estate market, which set off a global financial crisis last year, has eroded the value of collateral that aspiring borrowers can offer as security for new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, they say bank regulators are being tough on them to tighten lending standards, which officials now say were too lax and contributed to poor lending decisions that helped fuel the property boom and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Community banks continue to face overly aggressive examinations that can hinder small-business lending,'' said the Independent Community Bankers of America, eight of whose members attended the White House meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama said he would do what he could to help with regulatory issues, which he acknowledged might constrain some banks that otherwise have a solid capital base and would like to lend. But he stressed that the White House could not issue direct orders to independent banking regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking to see if there is a possibility to cut some of the red tape,'' he said. ''I think we do have an obligation to make sure that the regulatory schemes that we come up with are more streamlined and more efficient and send clear signals to the banks involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more we are making sure that banks aren't competing by how obscure their fine print is, but rather competing on the basis of the quality of their service and the terms of their loans, the better off consumers are going to be,'' Mr. Obama said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To this day, Bart Mitchell is not entirely sure he knows what a merchant bank is. ''I guess I think of it as the old-fashioned banker who takes the time to listen to his customer's needs and help them solve their problems,'' he said. (Actually, that is not far off.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing he is certain about is that if not for Next Street, a four-year-old, 22-employee merchant bank with offices in Boston and New York, his development company would have been in big trouble.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, in the teeth of the worst commercial real estate and lending crisis in a quarter century, Mitchell Properties managed to secure $5.7 million in long-term financing for an 84-unit condominium and retail complex in Boston's mixed-income South End.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing, arranged through U.S. Bank and a mind-numbingly complex public-private sector loan program known as the New Market Tax Credit, essentially retired $1.7 million of construction debt, shaving about $20,000 off the project's monthly loan payments. For Mitchell Properties, it was probably the difference between surviving the recession relatively unscathed and contributing to the growing list of belly-up real estate projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know what we would have done,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''In general, the projects that qualify for the program are much bigger than ours, but Next Street knew all the parties and was able to put the pieces together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a common refrain for Next Street clients, by and large established businesses with $5 million to $50 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executives of these companies, which include a Boston-area moving business with as many as 400 seasonal employees, a major supplier of refurbished toner cartridges, and a manufacturer of truck batteries that meet California's stringent new idling restrictions, report that Next Street fills a vital role for their organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one has said that its blend of Fortune-500-level advice and access to sophisticated financing could be a solution to the small-business credit squeeze threatening to derail the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what makes Next Street intriguing: It may be the only small-business merchant bank in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wish there were more,'' said Tim Ferguson, the British-born co-founder and partner of Next Street. ''And we've looked, but, with the exception of a few specializing in alternative energy and biotech, we haven't found any.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although most people have only a vague notion of what the term means, at one time many of the dominant financial institutions in the world were merchant banks: Rothschild, M.M. Warburg, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>, Lazard, Hambros and Barings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great merchant bankers advised kings and railroad barons, bankrolled the Dutch East India Company and the California gold rush, and underwrote the bonds for North Sea oil drilling. Of that group, just Rothschild and Lazard operate in anything approaching their old form. And neither is likely to touch a client with less than half a billion dollars a year in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, to Mr. Ferguson, who started his career at Hambros, the classic merchant-banking formula of trusted advice and access to growth capital seemed to be exactly what the small businesses in his adopted country were missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2005, the banker, now 52, was serving out a noncompete agreement after a long time as senior managing director at <span class="companylink">Putnam Investments</span> and sitting on nonprofit boards advising small businesses in working-class neighborhoods of Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he learned how many of the companies used credit cards as their capital, he called a fellow board member, Ronald L. Walker, then at Sovereign Bank and one of the most senior African-American commercial lending executives in New England, and asked what he thought about starting a small-business merchant bank and whether there would be enough clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My first reaction was, 'What's a merchant bank?' '' Mr. Walker said. ''But my second reaction, because I ran the small-business portfolio at Sovereign, was, absolutely, there were plenty of businesses who'd be interested.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the bank lists more than 50 companies as clients. Much of its time, especially in the early stages of a relationship, is spent encouraging entrepreneurs to challenge assumptions about their operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'd be amazed at how often, when you ask a business owner what's the most profitable area of your business, they don't know,'' Mr. Walker said. ''They know what areas bring in the most revenue, but when you really break down their cost structure and profit margins, it's a revelation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The merchant bank's services, which are usually billed on a retainer ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 a month, run the gamut from big-picture strategy of the sort offered by a <span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Company</span> or <span class="companylink">Bain &amp; Company</span> to organizational psychology to the kind of intimate, delicate counsel usually tendered only by the closest consigliere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, for example, Beth Williams, chief executive of Roxbury Technology, the remanufacturer of toner cartridges, called on Next Street to help her deal with the discovery that a senior executive had embezzled half a million dollars. ''My first call was to my lawyer,'' she said. ''My second was to Next Street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another client, Larry O'Toole, chief executive of Gentle Giant Moving, relied on Next Street to manage the hiring process after his longtime chief financial officer was wooed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have formal financial training, so I lean heavily on my C.F.O.,'' Mr. O'Toole said. ''I got 70 resumes in. They all looked great to me, but the person they found was incredible. In fact, he's really more of a Fortune 400 C.F.O. who'd be making $400,000 a year but, fortunately for me, had already done the big-company thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, though, capital remains a priority. The majority of job creation is predicted to come from small companies in the years ahead. The Obama administration has acknowledged the prospect by holding a White House meeting on the issue recently and unveiling several programs aimed at encouraging banks to lend. As the Mitchell Properties example illustrates, however, that the programs exist does not mean private-sector companies will figure out how to exploit them without intermediaries like Next Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the merchant banks of old, Next Street is also putting its own capital to work. Several early loans totaling roughly $5 million were made directly off the bank's balance sheet, and it is raising a $100 million small-business investment fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next Street is the first to concede, though, that its model can be done on a large scale only if other investors participate. It is interesting to note that even the recent commitment by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> of $500 million for small-business education, loans and grants is primarily coming from the investment bank's foundation. It is an act of charity (and a grand public relations gesture), not investment banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel strongly that the small-business market deserves access to the same level of advice and capital as larger companies,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''But, until now, the attitude has been, why focus on it? The deals are too small. We can't make enough money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a provocative proposal for addressing the nation's employment and small-business credit crisis: Bring back the merchant bank -- and, of course, explain what it is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While selling in foreign markets has risks, small businesses like Air Tractor have been able to establish footholds abroad by relying on the <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank of the United States</span> to ensure they are paid for the goods and services they sell outside the United States.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without the Ex-Im Bank's guarantee, there would be a significant difference in the deals we can make,'' said David A. Ickert, the company's vice president for finance. ''We have been surviving and thriving because of exports.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Air Tractor has been exporting its planes for agricultural seeding, fertilizing and spraying since 1995, when it sold its first two aircraft in Spain. Since then, overseas sales have been a boon to a company that employs 200 people in a town with 3,400 residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has tapped into the little-known services that the federal government provides to American exporters by compiling research and information about markets in foreign countries and by helping companies with financing. The Export-Import Bank, which is the official American export credit agency, guarantees loans and provides insurance and direct loans. The Commerce Department and all 50 states also offer help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank, which has seven regional offices to help small businesses export their goods and services, authorized $4.36 billion in 2,540 transactions to support small business exports in fiscal year 2009. And the bank, which turned 75 this year, is ready to do more, said Diane Farrell, a member of the bank's board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the capacity to do direct lending, and in these changing times, we will be looking to do more of it,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress is urging the federal government to take a larger role in helping small businesses with exports. The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship this month approved legislation to bolster small business trade opportunities, and asked the Small Business Administration to appoint an official to focus on international trade programs. Federal lawmakers have also asked Ronald Kirk, the United States trade representative, to appoint a top-level official to open overseas markets to more American small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than 1 percent of the nation's nearly 26 million small businesses are exporters, said Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the Senate small business committee. Those 240,000 businesses, she said, account for only 29 percent of the United States' export volume, a number that that has decreased in the last 10 years, according to a letter Senator Landrieu and the committee's ranking Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, wrote to Mr. Kirk this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some small businesses said that in the current economic slump -- federal statistics show overall exports by the United States fell 11.2 percent from October 2008 to October 2009 -- their sales abroad remained strong and that they had been able to add jobs. Mr. Ickert of Air Tractor said the company had hired 30 people in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineered Systems and Equipment, a manufacturer of animal feed processing equipment in Caney, Kan., has more than doubled its work force recently, said its owner, Josef W. Barbi. He said the 26-year-old company now had 50 employees, an increase from the 20 in the last 18 months. ''We are one of the few companies in our area who are still hiring,'' Mr. Barbi said. Caney is in an economically depressed part of southeastern Kansas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Export-Import Bank insured a $500,000 deal for Engineered Systems to sell specialized pellet systems to a Honduran company, Proteina, which makes animal feed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was one of about $7 million in export deals in the last couple of years that Engineered Systems has made in Latin America. Backing from the Export-Import Bank has been crucial, he said, allowing his company to compete with European rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While American exporters like Air Tractor are small enterprises, the business they do abroad can be large. Another Export-Import Bank client, Weldy-Lamont Associates, an engineering firm in Mount Prospect, Ill., relied on the bank's financial support to win a $350 million rural electrification contract from the government of Ghana, said Patrick Hennelly, the company's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm, with only 13 employees, used to design projects like paper mills in the Midwest, but has branched out to win contracts in Thailand, China and Yemen, Mr. Hennelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aided by an Export-Import Bank loan, Weldy-Lamont has taken a five-year electrification project in Ghana where, Mr. Hennelly said, ''we're putting in the wooden poles and stringing the wires to electrify villages across the whole country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international projects are particularly timely, he said, because ''the current economic crisis has stopped a couple of U.S. projects,'' for his firm including coal and natural gas plants, from going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign projects can also lead to increased business orders inside the United States, said Kusum Kavia, co-owner and vice president of Combustion Associates, of Corona, Calif. Backed by Export-Import Bank insurance, her company won a multimillion-dollar contract to provide electric power generation systems to Benin. Ghana and Benin are in West Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts for Benin's 80-megawatt power plant power, Ms. Kavia said, come from suppliers in various regions of the United States. The gear boxes, for example, are made in Texas and the gear switchers in Pennsylvania. The generators are made in Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portion of the Export-Import Bank's financing for small business has increased in recent years, with prodding from Congress. In 2002, federal lawmakers told the bank to double small-business financing, from 10 to 20 percent, of the bank's overall authorizations. The bank has met the goal every year since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some lawmakers have said that the bank has cumbersome regulations and has not done enough to help small American businesses compete with heavily subsidized foreign competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office criticized the bank's data and systems for tracking financing for small businesses. The bank has introduced Ex-Im Online, an automated transaction processing system to help small businesses and financial institutions speed through its paperwork. The same site, www.exim.gov[http://www.exim.gov], also has a small business portal for first-time applicants.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT -- With $6,000 and some Hollywood-style spunk, four friends opened this city's only independent foreign movie house three months ago in an abandoned school auditorium on an unlighted stretch of the Cass Corridor near downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the unlikely hoopla of an opening night, red-carpet-style event in an area known for drugs and prostitution, exactly four customers showed up to see a film.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the Burton Theater has had a few profitable nights. But, the owners say, this adventure in entrepreneurship was never completely about making money. It was also about creating a more livable community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody could comprehend why we'd start a theater,'' said an investor, Nathan Faustyn, 25. ''But when you live in Detroit, you ask, 'What can I do for the city?' We needed this. And we had nothing to lose. When you're at the bottom of the economic ladder, you have nowhere to look but up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recession -- and in some cases because of it -- small businesses are budding around Detroit in one of the more surprising twists of the downturn. Some new businesses like the Burton are scratching by. Others have already grown beyond the initial scope of their business plans, juggling hundreds of customers and expanding into new sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across from the Burton, for instance, Jennifer Willemsen just celebrated the first anniversary of her shop, Curl Up and Dye, a retro-themed hair salon serving 1,500 clients. Not far away, Torya Blanchard, a former French teacher, recently opened the second location of Good Girls Go to Paris, a creperie. Next door, Greg Lenhoff, also a former teacher, opened a bookstore in August called Leopold's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And just down the street from Leopold's, on Woodward Avenue, Victor Both runs Breezecab, a company he started with a severance package after a layoff from Wayne State University. He uses rickshaws to ferry workers and conventioneers around downtown. ''This filled a transportation void,'' said Mr. Both, 34, who picked up the pedicab idea while touring Las Vegas before his layoff. ''I haven't made much money, but the experience has been priceless. I had no idea Detroit had so much love.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not an uncommon instinct to start an enterprise in bad times and seize on weakened competition, lower overhead costs and perhaps more free time. Nor is it limited to Detroit. But the trend is particularly striking here, in a city that was suffering long before the rest of the nation fell into recession and where hard times, business closings and abandonment became routine generations ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say the zeal for entrepreneurship these days in Detroit and elsewhere has precedent: according to research by Dane Stangler, a senior analyst at the Kauffman Foundation, a center for economic research in Kansas City, Mo., half the companies on the Fortune 500 list this year were founded in recession or bear markets. Further, Mr. Stangler said in an interview, company survival rates going back to 1977 show a negligible difference between companies founded in expansions and recessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some of the new businesses, preparation was minimal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All I really needed was a garage, a cellphone and a Web site,'' said Mr. Both, who started Breezecab with two leased rickshaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Blanchard's creperie was more complicated. The restaurant is in the first-floor retail space of what had been an unattractive apartment complex. When the site came under new management recently, the landlord offered to gut the retail space, spending about $70,000 on improvements, Ms. Blanchard said. She put in the rest: $15,000 in equipment, a coat of red paint, an oversize blackboard for the menu, and her own collection of vintage French movie posters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Ms. Blanchard pays what she calls a ''ridiculously low'' rent of $1,600 a month for a 1,000-square-foot space that accommodates 45 diners at Parisian-style cafe tables near the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was a place to watch your back just four years ago,'' said Ms. Blanchard, who founded the business with a cashed-out 401(k).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just wanted to do something that I loved,'' she said. ''And everything worked its way out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michigan, which has the highest unemployment rate of any state, has been aggressive in offering support for start-up companies, particularly in Detroit. The Michigan Small Business and Technology Development Center, which offers support and counseling, counts 20 small businesses, and 400 new jobs, created last year in the three-county area around Detroit, and the center expects that tally to grow as it completes its accounting in the coming weeks. That was down from 41 new businesses in 2008, but on par with the 23 such start-ups in 2007 and 24 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Wayne State University's business incubator, TechTown, housed in a former auto plant, 150 companies jostle for space -- up from one when the building opened five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I find it inspiring,'' Peter Bregman, the chief executive of Bregman Partners, a New York management consulting firm, said of what is happening in Detroit. ''There's something about that feeling -- 'Maybe America abandoned us, but we're not going to abandon us.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the entrepreneurs have tapped into buyers' penchants for spending locally in a bad economy, along with a longstanding void in the service industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some business owners are also capitalizing on a newly energized nostalgia for the vibrant Detroit that used to be, and the more general trend toward urban living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a passion project for most people,'' said Claire Nelson, owner of the Bureau of Urban Living, an accessories boutique, and one of the organizers of a loose network of local entrepreneurs that functions like a support group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got all this empty space in Detroit,'' said Ms. Nelson, 33. ''If landlords are willing to work with us, we pour our hearts and souls into the place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Burton Theater carved out its space in the schoolhouse that closed in 2002 -- a 1920s-era building that had receded into the shadows like so many empty spaces in Detroit -- the city, which had let the block go dark, turned the streetlights back on. The relighting was a victory felt far beyond the Burton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our business ideas are about taking ownership of where you are and what you have,'' said Ms. Willemsen, 29, of Curl Up and Dye. ''We want to do right by our neighbors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some customers are going out of their way to support the new city businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I live in the suburbs where I used to get my hair cut until Jen opened a store,'' said Dessa Cosma, a client at Curl Up and Dye. ''I'd rather spend my money here. It's a conscious decision for someone who cares about the city.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, Elizabeth Sheehan, the founder of Containers to Clinics, a nonprofit organization in Dover, Mass., was preparing to deploy the group's first medical clinic overseas. Made from two shipping containers, it was to be sent to the Dominican Republic, where it would begin to fulfill the group's long-term goal of building health care infrastructure in developing countries through networks of small container clinics in rural areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, last Tuesday, a magnitude 7 earthquake struck the Dominican Republic's neighbor, Haiti. Hospitals in the capital, Port-au-Prince, were destroyed or damaged, and basic medical care was practically nonexistent. Ms. Sheehan said her donors immediately started calling her. ''They all said, 'Why don't you send it there?' '' she said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the group may dispatch the clinic, which has two examining rooms, a laboratory and a pharmacy, to Port-au-Prince if a medical team and supplies can be arranged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can be used in this disaster situation,'' Ms. Sheehan said, and then left in Haiti or sent on to Bani, on the Dominican Republic's south coast, to fulfill the original mission. ''We are committed to long-term primary health care for women and children.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Containers to Clinics is one of many innovative approaches to building or rebuilding infrastructure in developing countries, to help forestall disasters or, as in Haiti, recover from one. Among them are new ideas and projects to supply quality housing, clean water, proper waste treatment and affordable energy, in addition to health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their promoters share a belief that while the conventional top-down approach, by governments and large relief agencies coming in with large projects, works for initial relief and recovery, long-term reconstruction -- ''building back better,'' in the parlance of redevelopment specialists -- requires more involvement of local people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't just sweep in from outside and drop something in and say, 'This is exactly what you need,' '' said Laura Sampath, manager of the International Development Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It has to be almost driven from the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.I.T. effort includes the D-Lab, whose instructors and students work on low-tech solutions to infrastructure problems and spend time in the field implementing them. Among the projects are ones to manufacture ceramic water filters in Ghana; install chlorine dispensers to treat drinking water in Kenya; and develop a bicilavadora, a pedal-powered washing machine, in Peru.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're graduating engineers who realize it's important to talk to people first,'' Ms. Sampath said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sheehan said converting old shipping containers into clinics was just a first step; her group must find doctors and nurses to staff them, as well as drugs and supplies. ''We're committed to putting in the human system as well,'' she said. So partnerships with local health groups are crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group, a small nonprofit organization in San Francisco, projects are also developed from the ground up by providing support to local entrepreneurs, said Peter Haas, its founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haas spoke while traveling to Haiti, where, before the earthquake, his group had been set to announce a competition for local entrepreneurs to develop plans for infrastructure projects. The competition has been delayed, and the group has added a new category: earthquake-resistant housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Haiti, Mr. Haas's group has already been helping Coopen, a business cooperative in Cap Haitien that will collect organic waste and human waste from public toilets and convert it to biogas, a fuel, for cooking. And in Guatemala, the group has aided a small company, XelaTeco, that builds hydroelectric projects for rural villages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're really not trying to dump some new expert solution on the population,'' Mr. Haas said. Working through local businesses, he said, ensures that ideas that do not work do not stay around. ''If a business fails and the market doesn't accept the product, it disappears,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malcolm G. Anderson, a professor in the School of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Bristol in England, said: ''With a bit of support, the poorest people can provide infrastructure, they can do things. The fundamental thing is to change people's behavior'' by involving them in the effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With help from the World Bank, Dr. Anderson has undertaken projects in St. Lucia and elsewhere in the Caribbean to reduce disaster risk in hilly shantytowns. These unplanned urban areas typically have no drainage infrastructure, and heavy rains can saturate the ground, leading to mudslides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Anderson's solution is to help local people understand the drainage problem, work with them to design a solution (usually involving a simple network of drains to move rainwater off risky slopes) and hire them to build it. ''People have a really good understanding of the fundamentals of what's going on,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these infrastructure projects are small in scale, dwarfed by the scope of disasters like the earthquake in Haiti. But some redevelopment specialists say that by training government and relief agency officials in their bottom-up methods, the efforts can be scaled up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After studying reconstruction work in western India following a 2001 earthquake that killed more than 20,000 people, Elizabeth A. Hausler, an engineer, founded Build Change to help communities build earthquake-resistant housing. In India, she found that the top-down approach did not work. ''Homeowners were not really involved,'' she said. ''Contractors would swoop in and build a bunch of houses for people and leave.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those houses were often not appropriate for the culture or the climate, she said. For example, they might have the main door on the street, when homeowners wanted it on the courtyard. ''If a door is in the wrong place, then the homeowner is going to knock a hole in the wall -- and that's not good for the structure,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hausler's approach, carried out in Indonesia after the 2004 earthquake and tsunami and in China after the 2008 Sichuan quake, has been to involve homeowners in the design and building process, modifying traditional designs to improve earthquake resistance. Along the way she has trained aid officials and worked with local governments to enforce building standards. ''That was a good way of reaching more homeowners,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her organization is now developing a plan to help rebuild homes in Haiti, where many of the destroyed buildings were made of concrete block, without adequate reinforcement against shaking. ''I imagine we'll have the same kind of program in Haiti,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she was convinced that the bottom-up method was best for rebuilding after that kind of disaster: ''Really, you'd have to have your head in the sand to not buy into this approach.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Thursday about music-related and other small businesses in Lititz, Pa., misstated the name of a rock sound-system company that has its offices there. The company is Clair, not Clair Brothers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Mon Feb 01 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LITITZ, Pa. -- This small town in Pennsylvania Dutch country, in the midst of cornfields and dairy farms, would seem an unlikely home for a warehouse filled with the detritus of rock concerts past and future -- a large section of the stage for the next Black Eyed Peas tour, the sets for an Elton John concert and gigantic lips from the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Michael Tait, whose stage-building and designing company Tait Towers, owns the warehouse, said life in Lititz was too good to move elsewhere. In fact, Mr. Tait said, if any of his employees are ever interested in going elsewhere for a job, he'll pay their expenses while looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's worth it,'' he said. ''They almost always come back. You could go to L.A. or New York, but it would never be as comfortable and it would surely be more expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lititz (pronounced LIT-itz), population 9,000 and about a dozen miles north of Lancaster, is a haven of sorts to other small businesses. Clair Brothers, which says it is the biggest rock sound-system company in the country, is there, as is Atomic Design, which does a lot of the backdrops for music and theatrical staging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And beyond music-related businesses, there is an unusual combination of other companies whose products or expertise are known beyond the Lititz town limits: Woodstream, which produces the Victor mousetrap; <span class="companylink">Wilbur Chocolate</span>, maker of a Hershey Kiss competitor, Wilbur Buds; Sturgis Pretzels, which says it is America's first commercial pretzel maker; and Lititz Watch Technicum, a school where Rolex watchmakers study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Barry Miller, the director of retail banking for Susquehanna Bankshares, Lititz is a natural business haven. Susquehanna itself is now a $14 billion enterprise, but its headquarters remains in Lititz, where it was founded at the turn of the last century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is just a formidable work ethic in Lancaster County, the hearty farmers who saw the Amish and the Mennonites around here working so hard,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Then there is an innovative, entrepreneurial streak here, too. Finally, there is the loyalty. The owners want to give jobs to local people and keep them here forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rock business, for instance, started just that way. Roy Clair and his older brother, Gene, who grew up in Lititz, got a rudimentary sound system as a present from their father when they were in their teens in the 1960s. They started setting it up for pin money at high school dances, and then for events at Franklin &amp;Marshall College, in Lancaster. In 1966, they did the sound for a Dionne Warwick concert, and then one for Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we didn't know is that the concert just before, they were at the Fontainebleau in Miami with Herb Alpert, and Herb, an engineer, wouldn't let them use his sound system,'' Roy Clair said. ''So when they got here, they sounded so much better, their wives were impressed. They asked us to do the rest of their tour -- we may have been the first sound guys to tour with a band -- and the rest, as they say, is rock history. We kept getting word-of-mouth business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Clairs also loved Lititz and found ways to truck their sound systems, as they became more elaborate, from there. They hired local people and taught them how to enhance and modify the systems -- louder, crisper, more hidden or more out-there, as the rockers wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, they met Michael Tait, an Australian who was doing production and lighting for the British band Yes. He wanted to go out on his own and, he said, ended up sleeping on Gene Clair's couch until he could get his business going. He, in turn, persuaded a British artist friend, Tom McPhillips, to come to Lititz and do the artistic part of the stages, as Atomic Design, while Tait Towers did the engineering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From his office perch on the second floor of a mini-industrial park, Mr. Tait -- whose anonymous four buildings have no sign identifying them as Tait Towers -- can see the Clair Brothers' factory and warehouse just past a farmhouse, and then look right toward Atomic Design's studios. Tait employs about 130 designers, technicians, welders, machinists and assemblers and, like those at Clair and Atomic, almost all of them come from a 20-mile radius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a tremendously motivated population here, but I guess that is tradition,'' Mr. Tait said. ''There are motor heads and rockers and just plain machinists and smart people, a good sampling. Plus, they want to stay here. Look out, it's a beautiful life. If you want to go somewhere, it's two and a half hours to New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wilbur Chocolate</span> no longer qualifies as a small business, since it is now owned by Cargill, but the chocolates are still made at the 125-year-old factory on North Broad Street, hard by the railroad stop. There is a homey museum and factory outlet there, its centerpiece the Wilbur Bud, a $6-a-pound upscale version of the Hershey Kiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julius Sturgis started his pretzel-making business in town in 1861, and the Woolworth family still runs Woodstream, which traces its roots to 1899 and the first Victor snap-action mousetrap. Woodstream has since made a billion of them, and also has a long line of other pest control machines and poisons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the businesses employs from a couple of dozen to a couple of hundred people, and none had significant layoffs during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess we were never hit badly,'' said Gaylord Poling, the chairman of Venture Lititz, the town's business promotion arm. ''Maybe it's because we are conservative enough here that we always bought and sold $300,000 houses for $300,000, not $600,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poling added: ''There are no big-box stores here and the only chain I can think of is the Subway downtown. Every other store is local.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soren West, now president of Atomic Design, grew up in Lancaster County, but said that when he was younger he had to get away. He became a ski instructor in Colorado and was a professional cyclist and art gallery owner. Then he was passing through Lititz and heard about Atomic and Mr. McPhillips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was 14 years ago and I begged Tom to hire me, to do anything,'' Mr. West said. ''I was really coming home. We have a little art colony of sorts in the county, with a couple of art schools and lots of small galleries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You say, 'Why Lititz?' and I say, 'Why not?' '' Mr. West said. ''You get the stimulation without the hype, and no one is in anyone's face.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy Clair tells the story of the time Billy Joel came to town to check up on a sound system for a forthcoming tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was in a limo or at least had a driver,'' Mr. Clair said, stopping to chuckle. ''So he's on one of the main streets and rolls down the window to ask someone where Clair Brothers is. The guy looks at him and says: 'I can't tell you. They don't like people to know.' I mean, this is Billy Joel. But this is also Lititz, where they respect a local business.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the glory days of the digital photo frame business, when his products were still a novelty and shoppers were flush with cash, getting a bank loan to manufacture them was a cinch, Michael Levy says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would say: 'We got a $1 million order from the Sharper Image. We need financing. With a snap of the fingers, the guy drove down to my office, we'd sign a document, he'd give us the money,'' Mr. Levy recalls, sitting in the Deer Park, Long Island, office of the Media Street Group that he runs with his brother, Norm.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like many other business owners, Mr. Levy saw his prospects change drastically in 2008 as the financial crisis unfolded. The Sharper Image and several other top customers filed for bankruptcy, and Mr. Levy found himself scrambling to keep the business afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His longtime bank wanted nothing to do with his company, Mr. Levy says, and several other banks spurned his loan requests, too. After a year of hand-wringing, he found an unconventional lender that was still making loans -- lots of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's called Hartsko Financial Services, and it provides short-term credit to small and midsize companies that sell everything from olive oil to women's sandals. In the last year or so, companies have been beating a path to Hartsko, and to other businesses like it -- even if the loans are vastly more expensive than traditional ones from banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Eitelberg, Hartsko's founder and president, said his company previously fielded many loan requests from companies on the financial brink. Now, he says, Hartsko can also pick from companies with solid financials that simply can't get a bank loan. ''What we are seeing is better deals than we did in the past,'' Mr. Eitelberg says. ''We were viable when banks were lending. Now we are overwhelmed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartsko's office, which is surrounded by Irish pubs in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, is a sharp departure from the sterile cubicles and prefabricated offices of most major bank branches. At Hartsko, nine employees vie for space in three modest rooms jammed with computers, printers and fax machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The floor below Hartsko was occupied by a massage parlor until about a year ago, when it was closed by the vice squad, Mr. Eitelberg said. An acupuncture clinic took over the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg, a burly 47-year-old sports fan who favors untucked dress shirts and open collars, decorates his office with trinkets honoring New York sports teams; a full lineup of the Mets, in miniature, adorns a shelf behind his desk. There's also a poster of the Three Stooges in golf garb and a framed homage to Tiger Woods, which now prompts the occasional ribald joke from his employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the credit squeeze has pushed some consumers to unconventional sources of funding like pawn shops and payday lenders, a constriction in traditional bank lending to businesses has benefited companies like Hartsko.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners say banks routinely reject applications for loans that were readily available just two years ago. In addition, many say the limits on their credit cards have been cut as banks seek to limit their risk amid the economic turmoil. To help ease the situation, President Obama, in his State of the Union address on Wednesday, proposed giving $30 billion to community banks to make loans to small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the Treasury Department began tracking lending by the 22 largest bank recipients of federal bailout money, and it found a sizable decrease in small-business lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a seven-month period ended in November, the banks reduced their small-business lending by $12.5 billion, an overall decline of 4.6 percent, the data show. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, the two biggest small-business lenders, cut their lending by 4.4 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively, during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Durrant, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> who oversees small-business loans, said that roughly half of the decline in lending to small businesses was attributable to decreased demand. In addition, he said a decline in sales and creditworthiness among small businesses had contributed to the slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> lent $16 billion to small and midsize businesses in 2009 and plans to increase its lending by $5 billion this year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, of course, are now more reluctant to hand over money to small and midsize companies partly because the practice is riskier than it was just a few years ago, when consumers were spending freely. Banks are writing off record numbers of bad loans and have tightened their underwriting standards to limit their losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After Chase said no, I went to Citibank. I went to Capitol One. I wasn't going to sit around waiting,'' says Mr. Levy, explaining that he needed to borrow $1 million last year for $1.5 million in purchase orders for new products, including frames with Wi-Fi access. ''All of them said the same thing: 'the underwriters, the underwriters.' They just tightened and, boom, they just shut it off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN small businesses face funding squeezes, Mr. Eitelberg and others like him offer an enticing, if expensive, pitch for desperate entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He peddles what is known as purchase-order financing to companies that sell goods but often manufacture them in factories abroad. It is a relatively new line of business -- he estimates it's about 20 years old -- and a twist on the ancient and much larger practice of factoring, in which a business sells an invoice at a discount to get its money faster, providing the factoring company with a hefty fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchase-order financing, though similar to factoring, is further up the financial food chain. Purchase orders are written guarantees from a buyer that it is committed to purchasing a product. By financing purchase orders, Mr. Eitelberg essentially pays the factory to manufacture the goods. Hartsko also pays to have the finished products shipped from the factory. Once Hartsko is paid for the merchandise, it takes its cut and hands over the rest to its customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are only a half-dozen or so major purchase-order financing companies in the country, and overall numbers on their business are hard to come by. A Hartsko competitor, Edward P. King, who founded the Dallas-based King Trade Capital 17 years ago, said his business grew about 10 percent in 2009. He said he could have done two or three times as much business but was cautious, given the uncertainty of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a risky year,'' Mr. King says. ''We could have grown an enormous amount, but I'm not sure we wouldn't be fighting some battles right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Banks may dabble in purchase-order financing, but usually only for existing clients. One big bank that that has a separate unit for such lending, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, says that this business has increased, even while its traditional small-business lending has dropped.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg says he doesn't care much about his customers' credit scores or their past financial problems. He simply wants to know that they have a solid deal in the works and a purchase order to prove it. ''We look for a viable transaction when we do business, not the net worth of the company or the balance sheet,'' he says. ''We say we look past the balance sheet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg estimates that his business increased 80 percent in 2009. But his money doesn't come cheap. It's typically 3.5 percent for the first 30 days, and 1.25 percent for every 10 days after that, an annualized percentage north of 40 percent. Most loans, he says, are repaid within 60 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For lack of a better word, it's almost like loan sharking,'' says Mr. Levy, who said his bank loans were at 6 or 7 percent annualized interest. ''But, there's a need. I had no choice. It's the only way I was going to get the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know I paid them a lot, but without them, I would have been home watching cartoons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg bristles at such comments, saying purchase-order lending is ultimately a risky business and that his fees are more than justified. He says he bases his fees on industry averages and the cost for Hartsko to borrow money from a bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're just saying that for the period of time when you are using our bank lines and our cash to run your business that you pay us a fee for what that's worth,'' he says. ''We believe it's a rate that is fair.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg began Hartsko in 2004 after working for years on the financial side of the garment industry, following in the footsteps of his father, who ran a women's swimwear company. He says he worked for several garment companies that struggled to stay afloat and had to seek purchase-order financing, often called P.O. financing. Mr. Eitelberg said he had an epiphany one day that he was in the wrong business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said: 'It's amazing, the only person that came out of this thing was the P.O. financing company. They made a ton of money and these companies died,' '' he recalls. '' 'So why am I doing this. Why don't I do that?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started Hartsko with a loan from several investors and a $1 million credit line from a bank. He lent his first customer $200,000 to make throws and pillows, and his business has grown every year since, by networking at trade shows and word of mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, he says, Hartsko's customers fall into three categories: start-ups that have little or no collateral, growth companies that may be profitable but can't get enough financing from banks, and troubled companies that nonetheless have viable purchase orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Hartsko lent roughly $150 million, compared with $84 million in 2008 and $60 million the year before that, he said. He estimates that the company will lend about $240 million this year. Profit, he says, was in the ''high six figures'' in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg oversees Hartsko's operation from a corner desk, with two of his employees close at hand: his father, Lenny Eitelberg, the former swimwear merchant, and Nelson Goldberg, another garment industry veteran. The three carry on a nearly constant banter about potential deals, loans that are under way and potential problems with existing clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing surprises us here,'' Lenny says. ''We've seen it all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg says he learned the hard way about the importance of background checks for his customers. Because Hartsko finances the production of goods -- rather than lending money directly to its customers -- it ends up owning the inventory if a deal collapses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Hartsko has been stuck with auto parts, media players and women's sandals, which Mr. Eitelberg tries to sell for whatever he can get. But 49 boxes of the sandals remain stacked outside the office door, alongside the staircase. And he says he's still fighting to recover his biggest loan loss -- $500,000 that he lent to a company that says it was making olive oil in Italy, though the shipment never arrived. He estimates that roughly 5 percent of his deals go sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Mr. Eitelberg now uses private detectives to help with background checks. In addition, he makes sure that merchandise is inspected before it leaves the factory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON a recent weekday afternoon, two of Hartsko's customers stopped at the office to meet Mr. Eitelberg and to map out financing needs in the coming year. The customers, Erik Searles and Mark Cardinale, said they had bought a children's clothing brand called Sprockets and were hoping to sell the clothing nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg, who had already provided Sprockets with one loan, offered to continue financing the company until it was established enough to qualify for less expensive credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like several other Hartsko customers, Mr. Searles said he was grateful, despite the cost of the loans. Instead, customers reserved their ire for the federal government and the banks, saying the billions of bailout money larded on Wall Street had done nothing to help them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The money isn't going to the people who actually need it,'' Mr. Cardinale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James LaBarber, another Hartsko customer, whose company sells vinyl flooring, says he has been a customer at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> for 29 years. But he said bank officials told him that it would take 6 to 12 months to get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Trying to get a small-business loan is like trying to get someone out of Guantanamo Bay,'' Mr. LaBarber says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said it does not comment about specific customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eitelberg, too, wonders why some of the federal bailout money hasn't ended up in Hartsko's coffers. Even if his rates are relatively steep, he says, he is ultimately limited by how much money he can borrow from banks and would welcome a low-interest loan from the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I had money, I could lend it,'' he says.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's speeches suggest he doesn't dislike all banks, just the big ones. Even though he used much of his State of the Union address last week to bash Wall Street and the money business, he threw a bone to the community banking sector. He pledged to divert $30 billion of money repaid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to smaller banks to help them make loans to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sounds good, doesn't it? After all, small businesses are the backbone of American employment. Giving them access to capital should help them invest and hire more people. And small banks, it would appear, are the most effective conduit for providing capital to small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Independent Community Bankers Association, the primary lobbying group for the nation's 8,000 smaller banks, institutions with less than $1 billion in assets hold only 12 percent of all bank assets but have made 40 percent of the small business loans currently outstanding. Big banks -- those with $100 billion or more in assets -- made only 22 percent of such loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Obama's idea sounds logical. But there are problems that would probably make any plan that the White House proposes both unworkable and bad for taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, community banks don't need the money. While the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> regularly has to close down troubled small banks (including five on Friday), in aggregate, the industry is relatively flush. In the third quarter, banks with assets of less than $5 billion on average had tangible common equity equal to 9.62 percent of tangible assets. That's a stronger capital position than big banks, whose equivalent ratio stood at just 7.97 percent on average, according to SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, small banks appear to be hoarding the money they do have, lending out just 82 percent of their deposits. That's a lower loan-to-deposit ratio than the 91 percent at big banks. And it may not be their fault: the Federal Reserve's survey of loan officers released in October suggested that 35 percent of domestic banks were experiencing weaker demand for loans from smaller companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if that were to change, small banks are unlikely to accept bailout cash without major changes to the way the program has been administered so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the smaller banks don't really need the money, Paul Merski, the chief economist for the Independent Community Bankers Association, says they would want some conditions removed. Among the concessions they would expect are lower dividend payments to the government on any capital it lent them, no stock warrants attached to the investment, and no restrictions on executive pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These strings attached to the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout were safeguards the Treasury imposed to protect taxpayer money. The Treasury invested $205 billion in 707 banks, receiving senior preferred stock or other securities. To date these have generated a 3.1 percent absolute return. Fold in the sale of warrants the Treasury received over stock in 34 of the banks and the return jumps to 8.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relaxing the requirements of the program rules would seem at odds with the president's other objectives of reducing debt and closing the yawning budget deficit. It's also not clear the Treasury could simply waive conditions without an act of Congress, where members may be disinclined to sanction another banking initiative financed by taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government could still try to ease the flow of money to small businesses in other ways. It could set up an entity to buy small-business loans from community and other banks, and then sell them on to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the idea behind the Venture Enhancement and Loan Development Administration for Smaller Undercapitalized Enterprises, also known as Velda Sue, but that proposal never got off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The troubled experience of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which play a similar role on a huge scale for mortgages, suggests that plan isn't so good, either. Indeed, add up all the elements -- slack demand for small-business loans, banks already flush with money and the potential for taxpayer losses -- and the conclusion seems clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest proposal to subsidize banks, even small ones, makes great political fodder. In any event, it's a bad idea.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, one entrepreneur had the opportunity to ask President Obama a question that no doubt has been on the mind of many others. The venue was a town hall meeting in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday, the day after the president's State of the Union address. ''I'm frustrated because I can create 500 jobs,'' began Steve Gordon. ''I've gone to the banks, I can't get a loan. You lent directly to Wall Street, you lent directly to the automakers, you lent directly to the banks -- why can't the government make [small-business loans] available directly to us?''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon, 53, started his company, Instant-Off, back in 1991. The Clearwater-based firm employs two people full time and 30 part time to make an inexpensive valve that conserves water by automatically shutting off a faucet like the spigot on a soda fountain. The valves are sold to the food-service industry, and also to consumers through <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, but Mr. Gordon says he lacks the capital to expand. Last year, Instant-Off's revenue was about $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The businessman was moved to ask his question after a particularly frustrating meeting two days earlier with a regional director of the <span class="companylink">U.S. Export-Import Bank</span>. Mr. Gordon recounted that after explaining why her agency couldn't arrange a loan for Instant-Off, the official suggested he audition for ''Shark Tank'', the ABC reality series that is sort of an ''American Idol'' for entrepreneurs. Mr. Gordon says he arrived at the Obama event two and a half hours early and chose his seat carefully -- at the president's eye level, near an aisle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president, in a lengthy response, explained that the Small Business Administration ''does not have the infrastructure to go all across the country in every region and process loans to small businesses directly.'' (You can watch the entire exchange, or read it here.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, The Times spoke to Mr. Gordon about his business, his ambitions, and his reaction to the president's answer. What follows is a condensed version of the conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You told the president that you couldn't get a loan. What happened?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. What started the big capital push is we didn't have the money to fill orders from <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>. So I called the S.B.A. in Miami, which sent me to all these microlenders in Florida. But they turned us down; they said they didn't have enough funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Did you try to get an S.B.A. 7(a) working capital loan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I met with SunTrust and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> -- <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> was my bank -- and they told me that I would not qualify because my credit score was not high enough. I came out of the building industry, and I lost my company during the real estate crash in 2006. I was right in the middle of a beautiful, $35 million town home project when the meltdown occurred. So when I lost all that money, it put me in a capital vacuum, and my credit score suffered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it wasn't just the credit score -- they needed hard assets on the floor. They either needed equipment or they needed to secure it against inventory. All of our stuff is hand-assembled; the equipment we have is probably worth $50,000. But I need $250,000, and they said, ''No, you're not going to be able to get $250,000 with $50,000 of assets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is your business profitable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If you look at our sales versus our costs, yes, we're profitable. But most of that goes to overhead and other costs because the volume is low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you paying bills on time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes, but barely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. The president said that one cause of the recession is that banks took on too much risk when they made commercial loans. Why should a bank -- or the government, for that matter -- make a loan to someone who has poor credit and no assets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, first of all, I'm not a bad credit risk. What happened to me happened to every developer and every builder and every single person related to the real estate industry nationwide. Every single one of us -- millions of people -- had their credit trashed because of this crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the government should take that risk because I'm a much better risk than A.I.G. I'm a much better risk than a lot of the things they've invested in because I can produce results now. They loan me the money, I can create jobs now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How much do you want, and what would you do with it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I need between $250,000 and $500,000. About $50,000 of this money would go to filing patents in foreign countries. We have customers waiting in the Middle East but I don't have the money to file our patents, so we can't sell to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second thing is, we need to be a direct television product. Instant-Off is a very visual product, and we're just about ready to finish our first commercial. We need money, between $50,000 and $100,000, to advertise Instant-Off in 15 to 20 markets, five times a day. I've already met with the people at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>. They love our product. They said, ''It works right within our sustainability program, and we want to start carrying more products made in the U.S. But unless you advertise on TV, no one's going to know about your product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What did you think of the president's answer to your question?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. [Sighs deeply.] I think he answered the best he could based on what he knows to be true. His knowledge of what is happening and what my personal experience is are different. I've met with the S.B.A. people, and I know how competent they are. And he says they don't have enough people to make loans directly. I appreciate the fact that he's earmarking $30 billion for small business, but it's not enough. How much of that is going to be loaned out? I know he really cares, and I know he's extremely smart. But he doesn't have the insight like I have. I'm in it, living it every day, and I'm struggling. And if he spent 20 or 30 minutes talking to me, he'd come away with the specifics he's missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Did you give your information to the president's ''body man,'' Reggie Love, like he asked?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I started walking down toward the podium, and a very serious woman in a trench coat -- a Secret Service lady -- came up to me and said, [affecting a low voice] ''Are you Steve Gordon?'' Normally I would completely deny knowing that guy --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Well, sure, given your history --</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. [Laughs.] Right. But I said, ''sure,'' and she said, ''I need all your company information.'' And she talked into her sleeve and said, ''I found him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's been the reaction from banks since you asked the question?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's been really good. I have a bank meeting this afternoon, from a bank that called me and said they want to help. And then I talked to someone yesterday who said he's on the board of directors of a community bank, and I've got a meeting with them on Friday. I got another call from an investment banker who wants to meet me Thursday. So I did get three calls from banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I had 15 or 20 calls from across the country from businessmen that called just out of the blue to thank me for asking the question.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve and other financial regulators prodded banks on Friday to ease financing to small businesses, while President Obama proposed expanding two loan programs run by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both steps, coming on the same day the government reported a small drop in the unemployment rate, were a response to the persistent difficulties that small and medium-size businesses have had in securing credit since the recession began.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses were responsible for the creation of 65 percent of new jobs over the last 15 years, the president said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The true engine of job creation will always be businesses,'' Mr. Obama said during a visit to Oasis Mechanical Contractors, a company in Lanham, Md., that installs and services heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What government can do is fuel that engine by giving entrepreneurs and companies the support to open their doors and to expand and to hire more workers,'' the president said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's proposal is the latest in a string of initiatives intended to help small businesses. Last week, he proposed a one-year, $33 billion wage subsidy that would include a $5,000-a-worker tax credit for each new hire. This week, he called for using $30 billion from the federal bank bailout fund to create a small-business lending fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest plan, which like the others would need Congressional approval, has two components, both involving the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would expand the agency's 504 program, which guarantees loans for real estate development, to cover refinancings. The expansion could help refinance up to $18.7 billion a year in commercial real estate that might otherwise face foreclosure and liquidation, officials estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other would temporarily increase to $1 million, from $350,000, the maximum loan size under a program called S.B.A. Express that provides federally guaranteed financing through a streamlined approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier on Friday, the Fed and other regulators warned that small businesses were ''experiencing difficulty in obtaining or renewing credit to support their operations'' and said that banks might have responded to the downturn ''by becoming overly cautious'' in making loans to such companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has faced political pressure to spur lending. The joint statement came just two days after Ben S. Bernanke was sworn in to a second four-year term as the central bank's chairman. He was reconfirmed by the Senate on Jan. 28 by the narrowest margin for a Fed chairman in the central bank's 96-year history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Days before that vote, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, had said he would support Mr. Bernanke, but only with reservations and after having urged the chairman to ease lending to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the statement, the regulators signaled that examiners of banks, savings and loans and credit unions had been instructed to look favorably on loans to small businesses that might otherwise seem risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank loans to small companies are primarily repaid through cash flow, and secondarily through underlying collateral. As collateral values have fallen, banks have been shy to make loans, fearing that if the loans go bad, examiners might force them to take steep markdowns, which could deplete the capital levels of the banks and further imperil their ability to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also said that banks ''should not automatically refuse credit to sound borrowers because of a borrower's particular industry or geographic location.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement expanded on two earlier statements: one in November 2008 that encouraged banks to make more credit available, and another last October that focused on modifications of commercial real estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the Fed, the statement was issued by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers of bank regulation were skeptical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ernest T. Patrikis, a partner at <span class="companylink">White &amp;Case</span> and a former general counsel for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>, called the encouragement to lend overdue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This statement should have gone out earlier,'' he said in an interview. ''We shouldn't have waited until now, when it's no secret that small businesses aren't getting credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Camden R. Fine, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said that banks had been cautious because examiners ''have become overly harsh.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When actual practices by federal bank examiners match the rhetoric of these interagency announcements, we may finally see progress in bank lending to small businesses,'' he said, warning that ''credit conditions will remain very tight'' until then.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A HALF-DOZEN children were waiting to hang onto a rope tow that would pull them up Mount Prospect, a small ski hill in Lancaster, N.H. I watched them scoot along before I, too, grabbed onto the rope, which, despite temperatures in the teens, felt hot from the friction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was my first ride up a tow, and I held on for dear life, crouching down so as not to fall over and looking to make sure my skis didn't cross. It was skiing at its most bare-bones, before the advent of the high-speed quad.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was also what skiing was like before the days of heated gondolas, ski valets and $97 lift tickets -- luxuries out of reach to many people, even before the recession. With many skiers staying closer to home for a second winter, neighborhood ski resorts are enjoying a resurgence, especially in New England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small resorts are reporting larger crowds and a few resorts have even reopened. According to Jeremy Davis, founder of the New England Lost Ski Areas Project, a nonprofit group dedicated to preserving shuttered ski areas, about 12 small hills have reopened throughout New England in the past 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These resorts hark back to the old days of skiing: no-frills hills with little terrain and a loyal local following. Some are fairly large, with two dozen or so runs and more than one chairlift. Others are true backyard affairs, staffed by volunteers and funded by donations. Instead of chairlifts, they offer rope tows powered by off-the-shelf motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These humbler hills also offer a friendliness absent at large resorts owned by publicly traded corporations and insurance conglomerates. Lift operators at these mom-and-pop-style resorts cheer you on and members of the ski patrol stop to chat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, these resorts are cheap, another reason their popularity has surged of late. Lift tickets at the medium-size mountains can run about $35 a day, but smaller hills charge a nominal amount -- somewhere between $5 and $15 -- and some take only donations. At Powderhouse Hill in South Berwick, Me., lift tickets cost $5 and doughnuts are free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intrigued by the low price point and notion of a classic New England experience and spurred on by a recent snowfall, my husband, Dave Shaw, and I decided to bypass the bigger mountains we typically frequent, such as Sunday River and Loon, and give the little guys a shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We headed north from Boston on a bright, frigid morning toward the Mount Prospect Ski Tow. A dinky little mountain in the northern part of New Hampshire, the resort opened about 80 years ago as a backyard run for local schoolchildren and their parents. It closed in 1997 after years of little snowfall and dwindling numbers of volunteers, but a group of residents with fond memories banded together and reopened it in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-hour drive took us north through the White Mountains and Franconia Notch State Park, a stunning pass blanketed in white. We exited the highway and drove up Route 3, through the White Mountain National Forest, past whitewashed churches and sweeping views of pine-covered peaks. There's no address on the resort's Web site, just a place marker on a <span class="companylink">Google</span> map, so Dave kept his eyes peeled while I slowed down before entering the village of Lancaster, a quintessential New England town with small shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would have been easy to miss. A tiny sign with a retro logo hung from a pole. There was no skiing in sight, just a little parking lot filled with cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We pulled in, parked and looked through a dense cluster of trees. The hill was a few hundred feet away, down a small path bisected by a cross-country and snowmobile trail. We grabbed our boots and skis and headed through the woods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon it all came into view -- children hanging onto the rope tow, adults schussing down the hill and a small yurt, a puff of smoke from a wood stove coming off its top, to store your snow boots while you ski. There's no hamburger grill, no apres-ski bar, no vending machine. There's not even a restroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Southworth, a volunteer who runs a timber frame company, was manning the rope tow, which is powered by the engine from a 1957 Chevrolet. Mr. Southworth grew up in Lancaster and wanted to help bring back a place for families to spend a few hours skiing on the weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the way things used to be,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hill is open four days a week and only for a few hours -- Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., and Monday and Wednesday from 3 to 4:30 p.m. A $7 donation per adult skier, $5 for a child, is requested and given to whomever is operating the rope tow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three runs, with a total vertical drop of 250 feet. Despite its size, Mount Prospect dares you to ski it hard, and well -- one run is called suicide because of its initial steep descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had never used a rope tow, and Mr. Southworth gave some pointers. Wear old or leather work gloves, because friction from the rope can, and will, destroy them. Tuck your poles under your right arm. Crouch down, hang on tight and you'll get up the hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hung on to the rope and started ascending. Almost immediately, my poles popped out and lay like wounded soldiers on the snow. I hung on until nearly the top of the hill and let go. The sky was bright and the views of the Kilkenny range were spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone brought up my poles, and we laughed at my beginner's misfortune. Hanging on to the rope tow was tough, giving my arms and chest a rare skiing workout. I tackled the main trail, which was surprisingly steep for such a small mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hill was fun for about an hour and a half, but we were ready to try something a little bit bigger. So we headed to Whaleback in Enfield, N.H. The area is visible from Interstate 89, about 10 minutes south of the exit for Dartmouth College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small lodge was filled with local teenagers dropped off by their parents. It smelled like French fries, which you can buy along with a lift ticket and hand warmers at a small counter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, Whaleback ''wasn't a lot of fun,'' said Tom Ring, 47, an artist from nearby Quechee, Vt., who was sitting at a picnic table in the lodge with his son Dylan, eating a homemade sandwich. Mr. Ring said that there used to be just a few ''homogenous'' trails that bored experienced skiers like himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttered in the 1990s, Whaleback reopened in 2004 with new trails, varied terrain and a welcoming attitude. Now, Mr. Ring said, ''It has fresh snow, bumps, jumps; it has it all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for crowds. There were maybe 25 other people on the entire mountain, and there was a foreign feeling, especially in the glades -- peace and quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conditions were inviting: packed powder that had barely been touched. The trails had whale-themed names (Dorsal, Blubber, Harpoon) and skewed toward the intermediate. The beginner-level green trails were windier and frankly more fun than most at other areas. The intermediate blues were both cruisable and challenging, and the expert blacks took advantage of the mountain's steep pitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I hopped on the one chairlift, which is very slow, and feels especially slow on 15-degree days. As the chair approached the top, the strains of Led Zeppelin came into earshot and the gregarious lift operator started dancing around and gave a thumbs up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ski the Whale,'' he screamed, his face beaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view of the highway isn't the most picturesque, but the mountain itself is covered in snowy pines. I headed down the main chute toward Spout, a blue trail. The first descent is wide and the snow is soft and nicely groomed, ideal conditions for wide turns. The trail was empty, the air frigid, the sun bright. It felt like I was on my own private mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I merged onto a feeder trail and gained speed as I headed toward the bottom, a surprisingly steep descent. I continued to go fast, turning tightly, passing the freestyle park and finally coming to a stop in front of the lodge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I headed toward the chairlift again. No one was in line. I'd probably have another trail to myself or encounter a friendly stranger, like a ski patrol member who stopped to chat for about 10 minutes. I hopped onto the chair and started up the mountain, thinking that smaller might just be better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU GO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small ski areas have resurfaced in New England. Be sure to call or check each area's Web site for hours, since most are open only on odd weekdays and weekends. Prices are for a single-day adult lift ticket on weekends.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S not the economy, stupid, it's you. So says George Cloutier, author of ''Profits Aren't Everything, They're the Only Thing'' (HarperBusiness, 2009). Mr. Cloutier, the 63-year-old founder and chief executive of American Management Services, specializes in advising small and midsize businesses and turning troubled companies around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His advice is to put profits above all. Always pay yourself first. Shock your laggard employees. Don't accept excuses. His ax falls on trade shows (''they're just a flimsy excuse for a paid vacation''), sweat equity (''I call it working for nothing and being a fool'') and teamwork (''vastly overrated''). And if you ever apply for a job at American Management Services, don't mention that you like to play golf. A condensed version of a conversation with Mr. Cloutier follows.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Lots of people blame the recession for putting them out of business. You don't buy it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm a little bit of a hawk on that one. The recession has been an excuse for poor performance. Why does your work dry up? Normally because you haven't built a strong enough sales organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What do most troubled companies have in common?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They have not implemented strong financial reporting. Small businesses fail to focus on the basics -- doing your P.&amp;L.'s [profit and loss statements] and paying attention to cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What are you trying to drive into people's heads when you say, ''It's not the economy, stupid, it's you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Look, what happened yesterday is now done. Tomorrow is a new day. I have to cut my costs viciously. I have to spend a great deal more time on my sales and marketing, and I have to stop whining and get to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You recommend that businesses never pay their vendors on time. What do your vendors say about that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We tell our vendors, if you're asking for 15 days, forget it. We're going to pay you in 45 days. You don't want the work? Tell me, and I'll find somebody else. You have to work on stretching your payables because every dollar you get in extended payables is an interest-free loan. You have to spend time, go see them and negotiate. Honor your word. But don't think 30 days is a good deal. It's not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You're a big advocate of micromanagement. What's wrong with hiring people you trust and letting them do their jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Getting good people is 100 times more difficult than conventional wisdom says. The fact is, you're going to deal with a lot of mediocre people, no matter how hard you try. You have got to have a system in place to check on how they're doing. If someone says, ''I'm going to deliver $2 million in sales in the first six months,'' you have to follow that every day. Like Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify. We actually have a button that's says. ''I'm a control freak and proud of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Tell me about being a control freak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I have an extensive control system. I can tell you right now how many sales have been made today with new clients. I can tell you what our bank balances were this morning, how much line of credit I've used, how many people were in the recruiting class we're having two weeks from now. I have a very strong view that you should be carefully monitoring -- and intervene early rather than late when you see something going off track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You tell business owners to forget about being likable. Is there something wrong with employees liking you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. You have to treat your people with respect. If they have a personal problem, you have to help them through it. You have to follow the law. But we also need to get things done as asked. The abandonment of that principle is a large factor in the failure of small businesses to achieve real profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do business owners coddle their people too much?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The concept that if you love your employees they'll perform is on the edge of insanity. It's not that you want to hurt your employees, but you have a mission. You're paid to produce results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Can your employees talk back to you or say, ''Sorry, boss, but that's a stupid idea?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We actually did a survey around Christmas of their attitudes toward the company. Two-thirds of them thought the company was changing for the better. We let them write any comments they had. One guy that worked for me for 10 years wrote, ''If I fell dead at my desk, George wouldn't notice for two days.'' Sure, we let them talk back. We like to listen, but you can only listen so much and then you have to make a choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What's your view of fear as a management tool?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Fear is the best motivator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Are you a tyrant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm sure many people would view me as difficult. If I ask you to do something and you say, ''Geez, I don't have enough time to do that.'' Well, maybe I don't have enough time to sign your check this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You say, ''Love your business more than your family.'' What does your wife think of that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, she loves me, but I'm not sure she would always agree with that. I'm not saying don't love your family. But if you don't love your business as much as your family, your probability of success is very much lower. Sometimes you just have to put the business ahead of family considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How many times have you been married?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. This is my third marriage. But you have to look at it this way -- it's over 63 years. I've had a lot of spacing between them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you have kids?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I never had kids... But I would also say my current wife has not ruled that out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.One might argue it's easier for you to take these hard-line positions because you haven't had to balance family considerations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I would be the first one to say it probably is easier. But the reality is, if you're not fully committed and prepared to sacrifice what many of us would view as the traditional family role, you have a much higher probability of failing in a small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What do you think of ''The 4-Hour Workweek'' [a best-selling book by Timothy Ferriss]?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Oh, forget it. I haven't even read it yet. I don't want to die of laughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You say the best family business has only one member -- in other words, fire your relatives. What's wrong with family businesses?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A member of the family, if they're not carefully policed or indoctrinated by the principle of the business, tends to feel entitled. That entitlement is terrible for morale and is terrible for the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What about a relative who's highly competent and well respected?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They should work better than your conventional nonfamily members. If they don't, parole them. Give them some money to go away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You say no owner should be satisfied with his business. What dissatisfies you about yours?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I feel that I should triple the size of the business over the next 10 years because I'm getting old. I'm a little dissatisfied we haven't done that. I semi-retired for about five years and that was probably something I won't do again. They're going to carry me out of here in my shoes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barbara Wright learned last year of a federal program to aid struggling small businesses like her South Side uniform company, she jumped at the chance to apply for the Small Business Administration loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought I could use the loan to help my cash flow,'' the soft-spoken Ms. Wright said as she pointed toward racks of uniforms at The Wright Fit, her store at 1805 West 95th Street. ''You know you have to pay for this, and when your customers are taking 30 to 120 days to pay their invoices, things can get tight.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So she went to her bank, ShoreBank, which helped prepare the paperwork, and she sent in her application. It was approved, and Ms. Wright borrowed $35,000, the maximum allowed under a special Obama administration 2009 economic stimulus program for small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She thought she could use the money to meet her cash needs, but she soon learned that the loan had a catch: It could not be used for operations. In fact, the money could be used only to help pay off a previous loan of $50,000 from ShoreBank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials and Congress structured the loan program to help banks as much as to help their customers. The loan to Ms. Wright provided enough money for her to meet her loan payments, but not enough for her to avoid making further cutbacks to her business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are still tight here,'' she said. ''The loan really helped the bank, but what about me?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wright is one of many Chicagoans who own struggling small businesses, the kind of companies that create most new jobs around the country. She is among the entrepreneurs that economists and President Obama hope will resume hiring and rescue the economy from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Ms. Wright is one of the lucky ones. Thanks to a federal guarantee that her lender will be repaid, she borrowed the $35,000 and appreciated the help. Thousands of other small-business owners say banks will not lend them money at any price -- particularly in troubled industries like home building, where credit is crucial and jobs are particularly important to the South Side and other black neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Getting a loan in this area has been hard for quite a while, and getting a construction loan is nearly impossible,'' said William Wolk, president of Team 4, a contractor and real estate development consultant who often works on the South Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Wright's mixed fortune at ShoreBank also suggests why the government's current efforts to prime the pump are sputtering despite record low interest rates and federal spending financed by huge budget deficits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While multibillion-dollar loan programs may sound like a boon to the economy, Ms. Wright's experience shows they have been structured so they help the people who do the hiring as much as the ones who make the loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wright has been in business for 14 years, employing a small staff and supplying uniforms to schools, businesses and institutions. For most of those years, business was good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things started to change in 2008 as it became clear that the nation's banks had gone on a credit binge that seeded many bank portfolios with toxic loans. As bankers and economists tried to figure out the severity of the problem, many banks slashed credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business conditions deteriorated as credit tightened, unemployment soared and many consumers were unable to keep up with their mortgages. A wave of foreclosures on the South Side showed that blacks in particular were struggling, and small businesses based in mostly black areas have tended to suffer along with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wolk said subprime loans, those with more onerous terms, and Alt A mortgages, ones with more flexible borrowing conditions, accounted for nearly half the home loans in some South Side neighborhoods. As troubles with those mortgages mounted, layoffs in the construction and manufacturing industries hit black neighborhoods particularly hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An economic-hardship report by the Metro Chicago Information Center shows that unemployment rates in predominately black South Side neighborhoods like Englewood, Chatham, Auburn, Gresham and South Shore are now two to three times higher than the average in other areas of the city. Some government reports estimate that the unemployment rate now stands at 20 percent to 25 percent in parts of the South Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other businesses surrounded by neighborhoods of foreclosed homes, unemployed workers and shuttered storefronts, The Wright Fit felt the economic pain. Ms. Wright said she cut back to only part-time employees about a year ago and started trimming expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My big customers started bundling,'' she said, a practice in which companies consolidate their purchase orders and tap one uniform company in hopes of winning a better price with a large order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I started partnering with others to keep part of that business,'' she said. But her customers started taking longer to pay her. Last summer she read about the loan program on the Small Business Administration's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wright contacted ShoreBank, which has a national reputation for operating profitably in low-income neighborhoods, and bank officials helped her apply with the S.B.A., which was one of the few programs the bank could turn to for aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, federal and state bank regulators, worried about the struggles confronting ShoreBank's customers, told the bank to improve its financial footing by trimming its loan portfolio and bolstering its capital. Both steps require ShoreBank to curtail lending. Under the American Recovery Capital Loan Program, the S.B.A. guaranteed that the bank's loan to Ms. Wright would be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wright said she was disappointed that her $35,000 loan could not be used to help boost her working capital and ease the pressure from her store's day-to-day needs. But using it to repay her ShoreBank loan did help her reduce costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look,'' she said, ''it's $1,000 a month that I no longer have to worry about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Berg, ShoreBank's vice president for marketing, said the American Recovery Capital program required that the proceeds of Ms. Wright's loan be used to pay the principal or interest on existing bank loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery capital program is only one of numerous S.B.A. loan programs, but the agency promoted it as one that would help small businesses weather the downturn and ease cash problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Schroeder, vice president of federal relations at the Community Bankers Association of Illinois did not know the specifics of Ms. Wright's case, but said it illustrated a broader problem that Congress needed to consider as its took up the far larger $30 billion small-business program that Mr. Obama proposed in his recent State of the Union message to help create jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have the Congress and the administration saying, Lend, lend, lend, and you have the regulators saying, Tighten your underwriting and strengthen your capital,'' Mr. Schroeder said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter two steps tend to discourage lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Ms. Wright, in early February she moved her store across the street to a space that is half the size of her former location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I cut my rent and utilities in half,'' she said as she searched her new space for room to store her inventory. Her work force is down to her, her sister and a couple of part-time employees, but she said the economic situation was still tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are just scared to spend money,'' she said. ''Many come in here, and it's like a bargain basement. They want a low price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said her customers were worried that they would lose their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You mustget creative, Ms. Wright said, and she is building her Web site to see whether she can use it to market her uniforms more effectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She will survive, she said, adding, ''I don't have any other choice.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Republican Congressional leaders come to the White House's health care summit meeting on Feb. 25, don't expect them to bring any big ideas with them. Instead, they will press President Obama to scrap his ambitious health care reforms and focus on modest proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may make political sense. Americans have certainly been spooked by all of the Republican hype about government takeovers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the small ideas the Republicans are championing would barely make a dent in the most critical problems threatening the health care system: the huge number of Americans without insurance and the ever-escalating costs of health care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be clear, some of the Republican ideas are good ones -- and many of those are already included in the Democratic reform bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both parties would allow dependent children to remain on their parents' group polices until age 26. They would also prohibit insurers from placing annual or lifetime caps on the amount they will pay; prohibit cancellation of policies after an individual becomes sick; speed the use of standardized, automated insurance forms to save administrative costs; promote wellness programs; and make a greater effort to root out waste and fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these are all worthwhile ideas, they are not enough to fix the broken health care system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most fundamental difference between the two parties is that the Republicans say it is too costly to cover all Americans. They oppose mandates requiring everyone to buy insurance and employers to provide it. And they resist any large expansion of the Medicaid program and new government subsidies to help the uninsured buy policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the Congressional Budget Office judged that a bill championed by House Republicans would leave some 17 percent of all legal non-elderly residents without coverage in 2019 -- the same percentage as now. The Democratic bills passed by the House and the Senate would leave only 4 to 6 percent uninsured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republicans also balk at many of the Democrats' proposals for holding down medical costs -- including comparative effectiveness research to help doctors understand which treatments work best and which don't, and cuts in Medicare reimbursement formulas designed to push providers to greater productivity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the Republicans focus on making insurance more affordable. Their strategies could indeed hold down premiums for the young and the healthy. But they are likely to drive up premiums for the older and the sicker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may also be good short-term politics -- there are a lot more healthy people than chronically ill people -- but it shortchanges those who most need help. And until the problem of rising medical costs is addressed, the government will never solve its deficit problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a look at the main ''fixes'' contained in Republican reform bills. They primarily affect people who buy their own policies or work for small businesses, not the vast majority who get their insurance through larger employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSURANCE IN ANY STATE The cost of insurance for individual buyers varies considerably by state. In New York, for example, the premiums are high because insurers are required by law to accept all applicants without regard to their health status and provide a wide array of benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under federal laws, health insurers can sell policies only to individuals in the states where they are licensed to do business. The Republican proposals would allow insurers to designate any state as their primary place of business and then sell policies to residents of any other state. Most insurers would probably choose a state with few requirements, enabling them to offer skimpy policies, shun the sickest applicants and keep premiums low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Budget Office expects that young and healthy individuals would flock to the lower-benefit/lower-premium states while the older and sicker would flock to the states where they are guaranteed coverage, causing premiums to rise even higher there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republicans are also calling for federal bonus payments to states that reduce the number of uninsured or states where insurers lower their average premiums for individual and small group insurance. The idea has some merit as an add-on to more comprehensive national reforms, but leaving the states to solve such major problems is unlikely to have much success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS The Republicans would allow individuals or small businesses to buy group coverage through various business, professional or civic associations. The notion, a good one, is that a broader pool should enable the group to get lower rates than an individual could. The downside is that these associations could also tailor their policies to attract the healthy, leaving the sicker out of luck or in small group coverage where they would drive up the average premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malpractice reforms The Republicans put great stock in the idea that malpractice litigation drives up medical costs -- forcing doctors to pay high premiums for malpractice insurance and leading many doctors to practice overly defensive medicine, performing needless tests or procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are right, but the effect is far smaller than their rhetoric implies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Budget Office concluded that an array of common proposals to clamp down on malpractice litigation might reduce national premiums for malpractice policies by 10 percent and lead to a ''slight reduction'' in tests and procedures. All told, national health spending would decline by half a percent, or $11 billion a year, a sum well worth saving but hardly a cure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malpractice reform is an area where the two parties could make progress. The Democrats, in their Senate bill, would provide grants to encourage states to experiment, such as having impartial experts render an initial judgment on malpractice claims or establishing special malpractice courts with highly trained judges to sift through the evidence. The Democrats could go further, perhaps by offering greater protection to doctors who follow best-practice guidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans, however, are bent on capping damages for pain and suffering at $250,000 and generally want punitive damages capped at $500,000. That seems much too little for a badly injured patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS Health savings accounts allow people to deposit tax-deductible dollars to pay their routine medical expenses. Republicans want to expand these accounts so that the money can also be used to pay insurance premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems reasonable, but the people who would most benefit are those in high-income brackets. The proposal would be of little use to people who couldn't afford to set money aside for future health care bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH-RISK POOLS Republicans reject the Democrats' proposal to require insurers to accept all applicants, regardless of pre-existing conditions. Instead they are proposing that the federal government provide grants to states to establish and expand so-called high-risk pools that cover people who cannot find affordable insurance on the commercial market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such pools exist in some 35 states. They currently insure only about 200,000 people and often charge premiums that many people find unaffordable, even with the help of modest subsidies. Unless they are granted substantially more money than the Republicans are likely to commit, these pools cannot possibly meet the need. The Democrats would enhance high-risk pools, but only as a stop-gap measure until their comprehensive reforms take force in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama is right to challenge the Republicans to come up with their own health care reform plans. And if real progress can be made at this month's meeting, the whole country will benefit. What Mr. Obama should not do is give upon his goal of covering as many Americans as possible or his goal of reining in spiraling health care costs. That is what he promised, and it is what the country needs.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JASON COWIE, the owner of Kingpinz Skateboard and Snowboard Shop in Houston, has done a pretty good job of getting his business noticed on the Web. Just type ''skateboards in Houston'' on a search engine, and his store will be among the first listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of his sure-fire ways to drive Web visitors and foot traffic -- buying search ads on <span class="companylink">Google</span> -- got to be pretty expensive. Mr. Cowie, whose shop is just 1,000 square feet, found himself bidding for placement against deep-pocketed national chains, and having to spend $1,500 to $2,000 a month just to keep up.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Cowie is trying something new: for a flat fee of $25 a month, he is making his listings on <span class="companylink">Google</span> stand out. Whenever his shop comes up in a search page or on a <span class="companylink">Google</span> map, it is adorned with a bright yellow tag. The tag links to the Kingpinz Web site, but these enhanced listings, as the ads are called, can also link to a coupon, store directions, a photograph or a video of a business, or, in the case of a restaurant, a menu or reservations page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yellow may be an appropriate color for the tag. <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s new enhanced business listings, which it started to test quietly in Houston and San Jose, Calif., early this month, have an obvious competitor: the Yellow Pages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think <span class="companylink">Google</span> is going to be the new Yellow Pages,'' Mr. Cowie said. ''More and more of these younger kids are used to <span class="companylink">Google</span>. They are looking at their phones rather than opening up a phone book.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the stout ad-packed books that land on the doorsteps and driveways of millions of American homes are an endangered species is far from certain. But <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s renewed attempt to court small businesses underscores one of the perennial challenges of Web advertising. Small businesses make up a majority of businesses in America but account for only a small fraction of online advertising dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, advertising from mom-and-pop businesses like dry cleaners, hair salons and cafes is a $29 billion market, according to BIA/Kelsey, a company in Chantilly, Va., that researches local business advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the early days of the Internet, Web companies have had their eyes on that potentially lucrative market, but their efforts have met with limited success. ''Individual local businesses are hard to reach at scale,'' said Jennifer Dulski, the chief executive of Center'd, an online company that helps users finds local businesses online. ''The only people who have been successful at capturing local businesses have had massive sales forces,'' like publishers of phone book directories, said Ms. Dulski, who was an executive at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> in charge of local content and advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negley Norton, president of the Yellow Pages Association, a group representing Yellow Pages publishers, said 10 percent of the industry's $13 billion in annual revenue comes from the Internet. He said <span class="companylink">Google</span> is a partner as well as a competitor, as many Yellow Pages companies help small businesses with their online marketing on <span class="companylink">Google</span> and other sites. Despite the growth of Internet marketing, he said use of print Yellow Pages remained strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Print books are going to be around for a long, long time,'' Mr. Norton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of Yelp, the popular site for reviews of local businesses, which <span class="companylink">Google</span> tried to buy last year, and advances by companies like Citysearch suggest that a growing percentage of small businesses is finally moving ad dollars to the Web.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s auction-driven search advertising system, AdWords, has confounded many small businesses. So <span class="companylink">Google</span> tried a new course. ''We are acknowledging that AdWords is really complex for small-business owners,'' said John Hanke, a vice president of product management for <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> has been laying the groundwork to get into the local ad market since at least 2005, when it opened its ''local business center,'' a directory of businesses whose listings show up in Web searches or maps. <span class="companylink">Google</span> lets owners post their listings free, allowing them to add information like hours of operation, phone number, address and directions. <span class="companylink">Google</span> says that more than one million businesses are listed in its local business center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the company released a simple tool that allowed business owners to see how often their listings were viewed or clicked, a hint of how Web traffic might drive customers to physical stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, <span class="companylink">Google</span> is ready to cash in on its investment, offering businesses enhanced listings at a small-business-friendly price. Other companies have offered similar flat-fee ads, but none with the heft of <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that is different about this is that it's <span class="companylink">Google</span>, and <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s reach and visibility is so much greater than anyone else,'' said Greg Sterling, an analyst at Opus Research in San Francisco. Mr. Sterling said that the Yellow Pages industry has 3.2 million to 3.5 million advertisers. He predicts that <span class="companylink">Google</span> could reach one million to two million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it's too early to say whether <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s approach will catch on. But its simplicity has appealed to a pair of Web novices. Suzanne and Neil Grover, who have owned a wholesale jewelry business in Houston for 35 years, recently decided to shift into retail. Just this month, their company, Inter-continental Jewelers opened its Web site, and they immediately bought an enhanced listing from <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I found it pretty easy,'' Ms. Grover said. What's more, she said, the price was right: ''It is almost free, so of course I am going to stick with it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was traveling via Los Angeles International Airport -- LAX -- last week. Walking through its faded, cramped domestic terminal, I got the feeling of a place that once thought of itself as modern but has had one too many face-lifts and simply can't hide the wrinkles anymore. In some ways, LAX is us. We are the United States of Deferred Maintenance. China is the People's Republic of Deferred Gratification. They save, invest and build. We spend, borrow and patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this contrast is playing out in the worst way -- just slowly enough so the crisis never seems acute enough to take urgent action. But, eventually, infrastructure, education and innovation policies matter. Businesses prefer to invest with the Jetsons more than the Flintstones, which brings me to the subject of this column.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had a chance last week to listen to Paul Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, the microchip maker and one of America's crown jewel companies. Otellini was in Washington to talk about competitiveness at Brookings and the Aspen Institute. At a time when so much of our public policy discussion is dominated by health care and bailouts, my public service for the week is to share Mr. Otellini's views on start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While America still has the quality work force, political stability and natural resources a company like Intel needs, said Otellini, the U.S. is badly lagging in developing the next generation of scientific talent and incentives to induce big multinationals to create lots more jobs here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The things that are not conducive to investments here are [corporate] taxes and capital equipment credits,'' he said. ''A new semiconductor factory at world scale built from scratch is about $4.5 billion -- in the United States. If I build that factory in almost any other country in the world, where they have significant incentive programs, I could save $1 billion,'' because of all the tax breaks these governments throw in. Not surprisingly, the last factory Intel built from scratch was in China. ''That comes online in October,'' he said. ''And it wasn't because the labor costs are lower. Yeah, the construction costs were a little bit lower, but the cost of operating when you look at it after tax was substantially lower and you have local market access.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These local incentives matter because smart, skilled labor is everywhere now. Intel can thrive today -- not just survive, but thrive -- and never hire another American. Asked if his company was being held back by weak science and math education in America's K-12 schools, Otellini explained:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a citizen, I hate it. As a global employer, I have the luxury of hiring the best engineers anywhere on earth. If I can't get them out of M.I.T., I'll get them out of Tsing Hua'' -- Beijing's M.I.T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets worse. Otellini noted that a 2009 study done by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and cited recently in Democracy Journal ''ranked the U.S. sixth among the top 40 industrialized nations in innovative competitiveness -- not great, but not bad. Yet that same study also measured what they call 'the rate of change in innovation capacity' over the last decade -- in effect, how much countries were doing to make themselves more innovative for the future. The study relied on 16 different metrics of human capital -- I.T. infrastructure, economic performance and so on. On this scale, the U.S. ranked dead last out of the same 40 nations. ... When you take a hard look at the things that make any country competitive. ... we are slipping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the government just boosted the research and development tax credit by 5 percent and lowered corporate taxes, argued Otellini, and we ''started one or two more projects in companies around the country that made them more productive and more competitive, the government's tax revenues are going to grow.'' With the generous research and development tax credits and lower corporate taxes they receive, Intel's chief competitors in South Korea basically have ''zero cost of money,'' said Otellini. Intel can compete against that with superior technology, but many other U.S. firms can't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does the Obama team get it? Otellini compared the Obama administration to a ''diode'' -- an electronic device that conducts electric current in only one direction. They are very good at listening to Silicon Valley, he said, but not so good at responding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to see competitiveness and education take a higher role than they are today,'' he said. ''Right now, they're going to try to push this health care thing over the line, and, after that, deal with the next thing. God, I'd just like this [our competitiveness] to be the next thing. Something has to pay for'' everything government is doing today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We had to do the bailouts, the buy-ups and the jobs bills to stop the bleeding. But now we need to focus on the policies that spawn new firms and keep our best at the top. ''Having run a company through a major transition, it's a lot easier to change when you can than when you have to,'' said Otellini. ''The cost is less. You have more time. I am a little worried that by the time we wake up to the crisis we will be in the abyss.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER 24 years as a marketing manager for Coors, Cinde Dolphin knew what was coming -- Miller and Coors had just merged their United States beer operations, and hundreds of jobs were sure to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried that these youth-oriented companies might lay off an old-timer like her, Ms. Dolphin decided to take a buyout and relax. She sunned on the beaches of New Zealand, went whitewater rafting on the Yampa River in Colorado and saw friends and Broadway shows in New York.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a few months, she realized that she missed working. So at age 55, she began applying for marketing jobs, confident she would be quickly hired because of her Coors pedigree. ''About four months into my job search, I realized I wasn't getting many callbacks,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Sacramento resident who has survived three bouts with cancer, Ms. Dolphin is not one to give up easily. She decided on an alternate tack -- she would start her own business and thus join the nation's fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs, those age 55 and above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mining her decades of experience, she created a marketing and public relations firm that helps California winemakers get their message out through <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and other social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm having a ball,'' she said. ''I can set up my own hours and work schedule, and do other things I enjoy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five million Americans age 55 or older run their own businesses or are otherwise self-employed, according to the Small Business Administration. And the number of self-employed people ages 55 to 64 is soaring, the agency says, climbing 52 percent from 2000 to 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ms. Dolphin, some use money from a buyout to finance a new company. Some of these entrepreneurs were already retired, but after seeing their 401(k) retirement plans plunge in value, created a business in a quest for extra income. Some had lost their jobs and, after months of searching for work, started a business to make ends meet, perhaps catering, cabinet making or doing photography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But experts on starting a business strike a cautionary note. ''The first piece of advice is don't buy the mythology -- all you need is a new idea, that you wander out there, you run your own B.&amp;B., you start your nonprofit and all the birds are singing,'' said Marc Freedman, founder of Civic Ventures, a group based in San Francisco. ''That's what you'd think if you pick up some of these money magazines. This is a pretty daunting decision, and it's also a risky one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People should start with some realism about what it takes to do this. It's important to realize that this is a trajectory that can last 10, 15, 20 years. That means take some time to prepare, whether it means going back to school or doing an apprenticeship. There's no need to succeed at the very first attempt at this. There's room for readjustment and regrouping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dolphin agreed that starting a business was definitely not a cinch. Complicated contracts and legal matters needed to be worked through, and she needed to get up to speed on Twitter. (At one point, she hired a 20-something Twitter tutor at $25 an hour.) But now she is well on her way to success, having lined up Story Winery and two other wineries as clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A business adviser told me, 'Take a leap of faith, and you'll see you're more knowledgeable than you think,' '' she said. ''I think other people can do it, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Russell, director of work force issues at AARP, said one factor driving older Americans to go into business is that because of the downturn, unemployed people age 55 and older have been out of work for 36 weeks on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of these people have a lifetime of knowledge, skills and networking they've amassed, and it's very easy to use all of that to start a business,'' she said. ''At the same time, we caution people not to invest their retirement savings into risky start-ups because if you lose your retirement money, you can end up worse than where you started.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study by Babson College and Baruch College found that Americans age 55 and above started 18.9 percent of all businesses created in 2008, compared with 10 percent in 2001. The 55-and-overs are playing a larger role in entrepreneurship partly because the number of Americans in that age category is rising rapidly. (The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found only a small increase in the percentage of those older than 55 who are self-employed since 2001, although it found a spurt upward since mid-2008.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One entrepreneur is Bob Mello, 57. He was teaching English at a preparatory school in Bay St. Louis, Miss., when Hurricane Katrina destroyed the school -- and his job along with it. Helped by government funds, the mansion where Sydney Pollack filmed ''This Property Is Condemned,'' released in 1966 (with Natalie Woods and Robert Redford), is being restored, to be used as a theater. Part will be used for plays, and Mr. Mello, pursuing his love of film, will turn part into a 100-seat repertoire movie theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seemed like a thing I'd like to do,'' said Mr. Mello, who is doing this for money as well as love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wish it was just a hobby,'' he said. ''Since Katrina, I've been substitute teaching and doing odd jobs, just trying to pay the bills.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is hoping a friend will donate $20,000 worth of projection equipment. ''This is pretty small scale, but it's daunting,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has numerous programs to help older entrepreneurs. Traditionally, laid-off workers cannot obtain unemployment benefits unless they are looking for a job, but in 10 states, they can continue receiving jobless benefits if they show they are setting up a business instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration has a Web site that offers advice and expertise to entrepreneurs age 50 and older. The site says age 50 to 70 is ''the perfect time to leverage experience, passions, hobbies and resources to launch or purchase a small business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norberto Bogard took advantage of the Small Business Administration's offerings. A year ago, he lost his job as a reporter for a Spanish-language financial news program that Bloomberg News broadcast in Latin America. His job search yielded just one offer, which would have paid far less than his old job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he struck out on his own. ''It was my dream, just to have my own business,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A devotee of Time Out, the popular culture guide, Mr. Bogard was amazed that nobody had created a Spanish version for New York. So he founded Pie Derecho (Spanish for ''right foot''), a free magazine that publishes 10,000 copies a month and relies on advertising for revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was surprised that nobody was pursuing this particular niche,'' he said. ''I knocked on the doors of many investors, but nobody wanted to support it, so I used money from my severance package. It was scary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He took the Small Business Administration's free courses on starting a business and legal matters for start-ups. And for advice and encouragement, he often turned to a mentor, a small-business owner whom a Hispanic business group had recommended to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogard expects to break even with his March issue, his seventh month of publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freedman of Civic Ventures observed: ''There's a growing number of people over 50 who are entrepreneurs. That network can be a real source of support and knowledge. That's no reason to go it alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civic Ventures gave its award for social entrepreneurship to Robert Chambers, who, as a car salesman, grew angry about the unreliable cars and high-interest loans often pushed on used-car buyers. After quitting that job at age 56, he founded a nonprofit company that helps low-income people obtain deals on reliable, fuel-efficient cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company, Bonnie CLAC (Car Loans and Counseling), based in Manchester, N.H., has arranged low-interest car purchases for 1,200 people. He sees it as a way of giving back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had enough assets to retire, but I got very passionate watching low-income people getting taken advantage of in the car business,'' he said. ''Being over 55 and the experience I had was important to making this work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeri Sedlar, a consultant on career change and an author of ''Don't Retire, Rewire,'' said two types of people start businesses: those who always planned to, and those who cannot find a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who planned to start a business ''have a leg up,'' she said. ''They have an idea what it takes to be an entrepreneur.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The others ''want to use their current skills and market those skills to new clients,'' she said. But she warned that many of these entrepreneurs stumbled because they did not know how to market themselves or did not have relevant or current skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have to keep up on their skills, keep up with the latest,'' she said. ''You need to be sure you are really a valuable asset. The entrepreneur of today has to be motivated not just to know their skills and the job, but to be constantly challenging themselves. Every day they have to be reconfirming to their clients, 'I'm good, I'm on top of things. Age is not a factor. Here I am doing it.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sedlar said entrepreneurs needed to create a realistic budget and should not rush to rent space for an office or workshop because that could mean high fixed costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She recommended testing the waters before plunging in. ''You have to try this on,'' she said. ''You can't just hold your own counsel. You have to have your own sounding board. It could be your accountant, your banker, your lawyer, your therapist, your trainer. You can't just talk to yourself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcia Duhart figured that out on her own. During her final years at <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, where she trained people to use computers, she devoted several days off to testing her idea of teaching computer skills to the elderly. When she taught a few classes at East Windsor Senior Center in New Jersey, people flooded in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People said they'd go to a family reunion and everyone was doing e-mail and they felt out of the loop,'' Ms. Duhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After retiring from <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> in 1998, she founded CyberSenior Services, teaching at senior centers and giving one-on-one classes for $35 to $45 an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My business spread by word of mouth,'' she said, adding that some days demand was so great that she left home at 9 a.m. and returned at 7 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've had students up to 90,'' she said. ''I'm 67 now, and I have a lot of energy to do this because I do what I love. I love teaching people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Stone, an author of ''Too Young to Retire,'' warned that starting a business can be emotionally grueling because it can mean lots of rejection in struggling to get clients and customers. He said new entrepreneurs needed to retain their confidence and know how to present themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warned older entrepreneurs not to go overboard and work 50-hour weeks because that could be exhausting and dispiriting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do our best work when we set a balanced lifestyle,'' he said. ''Instead of saying, I'm semi-retired, say I'm semi-working.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Washington debates how to help the country's struggling small businesses, states and municipalities have stepped up with an array of initiatives to stanch closings and save jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local approaches are as varied as subsidizing wages for new hires, running a $100,000 regional business-plan competition and giving out grants to help small manufacturers reposition themselves. Some states and cities are using federal stimulus dollars, and others are mixing federal, state and private dollars.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 100 Percent Hiring Subsidy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco is using federal stimulus funds to give immediate aid to small-business owners. Its $25 million program reimburses owners for 100 percent of the wages for certain new hires. So far, restaurants, cafes, delivery services and even law firms have hired nearly 1,800 people through the program, called Jobs Now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers do have to pay for Social Security and unemployment insurance, and the program requires those hired to have been unemployed for 30 days or longer. More than 800 businesses have signed up for the program, and the city is pushing to extend it beyond its September expiration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, said Steven B. Falk, chief executive of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, ''businesses had to warm up to the idea of turning to the government for hiring. Now, small businesses are telling me this is the motivation that pushed them to hire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraging Customer Loyalty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Cleveland-area small-business council is trying to shore up its 17,000 member businesses with a program that encourages consumers to patronize locally owned enterprises instead of big-box chains or Internet sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Council of Smaller Enterprises began a Web site called ''I Buy NEO'' -- that's Northeast Ohio -- where consumers can search for discounts and bargains at participating local businesses. So far, about 300 businesses as diverse as art galleries and home-improvement stores have signed up to offer rebates or discounts. About 11,000 cards, which cost $10, have been sold. ''When a resident buys locally,'' said Dan Roman, the council's director, ''independent studies have found 68 cents of each dollar stays in the community.'' The current average for the region is 43 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no charge for small businesses to join, and about two dozen companies have been signing up each month. Even though the program's $150,000 budget for marketing, Web development, printing and postage is modest, Mr. Roman says, sales activity tied to the loyalty cards has increased 40 percent over the last six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Training for Laid-Off Workers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last June, the Michigan Small Business and Technology Center began to train laid-off workers to start new ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, 527 people have taken the course, which the center offers in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. To date, 160 people in the Michigan program have introduced new business ventures, and more than 125 owners of existing businesses have enrolled in separate courses to bolster their chances of surviving. Another 1,000 would-be entrepreneurs are expected to complete the program this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployed workers, many laid off from the auto industry, come to the program with an idea for a small business and must search for capital on their own. The program, said a spokeswoman, Jennifer Deamud, ''preps the company for a loan and makes connections for the owner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the training is no guarantee of success. Only about half of the enterprises are likely to survive beyond three years, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which has been offering training since March 2009, in New York City, Philadelphia, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Tracy Pospeshil, 37, of Fenton, Mich., lost his job at an automotive supply company, he enrolled in Michigan's program and started a new business last spring selling engine-warming heaters for trucks and buses. He says he's on track to make a mid-five-figure income by this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping Small Manufacturers Retool</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut is using state money to set up a matching grants pilot program to help its small manufacturers -- many of them in the aerospace industry -- aim at the growing medical products market. The state budgeted $250,000 and is accepting applications for grants of $5,000 to $25,000, said Deborah Santy, director of the Connecticut Small Business Innovation and Research Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firms applying must provide at least three years of financial information, be located in Connecticut and be registered as a manufacturing company and keep their manufacturing in the state. Ms. Santy said she had received more than 60 applications for the program so far. Kristen Muschett, chief executive of aerospace test-equipment maker Habco, said the $35,000 matching grant was helping her explore the feasibility of manufacturing and marketing a new machine that helps stroke victims and other neurologically impaired patients learn to walk again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providing On-Site Financial Expertise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, North Carolina began a $600,000 pilot program called BizBoost to help the Charlotte area rebound from the big-bank layoffs. The program has provided financial guidance to 158 small businesses, typically with 10 or fewer employees, since last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Gov. Beverly Perdue announced the program would be expanded to the entire state, with $2.4 million in state and federal funds that will be used to add additional experts, including accountants and managers with small-business experience. The goal is to help small businesses with the nitty-gritty of managing cash flow and lining up financing. ''We are helping businesses manage their customer base, restructure their debt and position themselves to grow,'' said George McAllister, regional director of the North Carolina Small Business and Technology Development Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. McAllister conceded, it is hard to measure the program's success. One client, John Meeks, owner of AppleBlossom Insulators, said his insulation business got help from a BizBoost expert who did a financial analysis of his books, developed cash-flow projections, helped him ready his finances to seek an angel investor and helped him produce a 5 percent increase in revenue in a tough year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans and a Business-Plan Competition</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Missouri, Charlie A. Dooley, chief executive of St. Louis County, had heard complaints from owners who could not get bank loans, so he decided to spearhead a new small-business loan program called Boost. The program is administered by the St. Louis County Economic Council and uses county funds and a $5 million line of credit from <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>, a Pittsburgh-based financial institution that had recently bought a St. Louis bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program is aimed at owners who want to purchase land, machinery, equipment or buildings but do not have adequate income or net worth to qualify for conventional bank loans. The maximum loan is $500,000, and in the few weeks since Boost was announced, Mr. Dooley said, more than 100 owners have applied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county also started a business-plan competition featuring $100,000 in cash prizes and in-kind professional services. The competition, with money provided by the St. Louis-based financial services firm, Edward Jones, will announce its winners in June. So far, it has received applications from more than two dozen hopefuls, including would-be microbrewers and laid-off scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping Businesses Expand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Florida introduced a state-financed program to help businesses keep their employees by expanding their customer base. The GrowFL program helps established companies identify new markets, research industry developments and maximize their use of social media. The program has a team of business analysts whose assistance is free to companies with at least $1 million in annual sales and 10 or more employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the program, operated by the Florida Economic Gardening Institute, has enrolled 13 companies, including a Jacksonville industrial pump manufacturer that is trying to locate new customers after sales declines forced it to lay off workers. Another 72 established companies are in the pipeline for help. Gov. Charlie Crist has asked the legislature to add $3 million to the program's $1.5 million budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other areas, including Portland, Ore., have started similar programs.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When people willingly leave their jobs at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, the once venerated, now often vilified investment bank, it is usually to go run something big in financial services -- like, say, the United States Treasury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But occasionally Goldman alumni leave to start or run coffee houses, children's shoe manufacturers, home security outfits and medical services companies. These entrepreneurs sometimes ask themselves what they could have been thinking.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was to help inexperienced owners that Goldman started a $500 million pro bono project last November called 10,000 Small Businesses. The program is intended to kick-start small businesses, especially in inner cities, by providing applicants with mentoring, scholarships and -- through grants to community development institutions -- investment capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has, however, generated a certain amount of eye-rolling for its size (modest, perhaps, for a firm that counts profits in billions) and its timing (after the Congressional testimony by the chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and before bonus season).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inevitably, former Goldman staff members who are now unjamming their own printers have to learn practical lessons that are not taught on Wall Street. Like many entrepreneurs, they are happy to share their experiences. And not incidentally they also have some ideas about what their old firm can do if it really wants to help small businesses. Here are some examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEARNING TO ACT QUICKLY Chris Villar, 29, and Aaron Shumaker, 27, became friends as undergraduates at Georgetown University, where they worked on a student-run credit union. They both went on to Goldman: Mr. Shumaker as an analyst covering leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, Mr. Villar as an associate in a unit that took investment stakes in companies for Goldman's own account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Villar worked on a Goldman investment in a home security company and saw not only opportunity in the highly fragmented industry but also a chance to be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They teamed up with a third partner, pooled the money they had made on Wall Street, tapped some angel investors and started FrontPoint Security in 2007. Based in Tyson's Corner, Va., the company sells home and small-business security devices and monitoring services, emphasizing do-it-yourself installation and wireless control through P.D.A.'s, cellphones and the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Villar, the chief executive, places the 50-employee company's 2009 revenue at $5 million to $15 million. The company, Mr. Villar said, has not made any show-stopping mistakes but has experienced a few teachable moments, including the delayed firing of a marketing consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While FrontPoint emphasized organic growth based on service and customer word of mouth, the consultant advised the company to invest in online marketing and other ''brand building'' exercises. The advice, Mr. Villar now says, was not necessarily wrong; it just did not fit the strategy and culture he and his partners were trying to build. They stuck with the consultant for about nine months before pulling the plug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Villar says the main lesson is to act quickly when things do not feel right. Mr. Villar also says he and his partners have come to value incentive arrangements over straight fee-for-service deals. ''We try to give them a little skin in the game,'' he says, ''and we like them to feel the pain a little bit when we're collectively wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as advice for Goldman's project, Mr. Villar suggested providing venture financing for entrepreneurs with fresh business plans in industries (like his) that are going through big changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BE WARY OF EXPERTS Rudy Glocker had spent 10 years at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and was a vice president for institutional equity sales when, he said, ''I knew it was time for me to do something different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunity came in 2008 after he had reconnected with Brian Edgeworth, a Harvard Business School classmate, who together with his wife, Angela, had founded Pediped, a company in Henderson, Nev., that makes shoes for small children. The company's main selling point is that its shoes are intended to be healthy for developing feet -- the name is pronounced PEEDY-ped, as in pediatrician. The company has about 40 employees and 2009 revenue that Mr. Glocker puts at $10 million to $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Glocker joined in August 2008, as managing partner and chief operating officer, investing some of his Goldman earnings. One headache came when a customer, a California retail chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That and the deepening financial crisis had made the shoe company increasingly nervous about the creditworthiness of its clients, mostly small, independently owned shoe stores. Pediped decided to hire an outside vendor to keep tabs on which customers were not paying their bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Mr. Glocker said, was that if a formerly good customer, now squeezed by the economy, paid Pediped even a little slowly, the credit company stopped Pediped from shipping it any more goods. As a result, Mr. Glocker said, the company wound up collecting less money and outraging its customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first lesson learned, Mr. Glocker said, was that ''when you are in small business and somebody says they are an expert, all your defenses should go up.'' And second, do not trust anybody to take care of your customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His advice for Goldman: Why not create a business that would, for a fee, gather financial data from small companies and generate reliable credit ratings? These ratings, Mr. Glocker said, could be used to securitize loans and sell the resulting bonds. Any role in the creation of such a market would, Mr. Glocker said, allow Goldman to claim: ''We're the friend of Main Street, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NEW VOCABULARY Heather Coughlin, 36, left <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> in 2009 after nine years with the firm, first in equity sales and finally as a vice president for Hudson Street, a Goldman unit that distributes data created by boutique investment research firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Yale Business School seminar in 2008, she met Johanna McChesney, founder of a Boston-based business called Isis Maternity. Recruiting customers through hospitals and doctors in the Boston area, Isis offers childbirth, baby care and other classes to new parents and their children. The business, which also has a retail component -- selling products like strollers, toys and nursing bras -- has four locations in and around Boston and 130 employees. It grossed $6 million to $10 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Coughlin, an Isis customer, had been looking for a career change and began consulting informally with the company. ''We 'dated' for about nine months,'' Ms. Coughlin says. Now she adds, she and Ms. McChesney ''share a brain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Isis's vice president for business development, Ms. Coughlin's current mission is to find investors and professionalize the young company. Recently she conducted a PowerPoint presentation on Isis's plans for the staff. She powered through the financial jargon that is lingua franca on Wall Street but meaningless to most childbirth professionals. A few days later, a colleague -- ''a kind soul,'' she said -- took her aside and offered a gentle critique. ''She said, 'You have to use different words,' '' Ms. Coughlin recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her old office at Goldman, Ms. Coughlin said, she had a view of Boston Harbor. Now she shares a windowless office with a colleague who often jokes, apropos of some discussion on childbirth, ''I bet they didn't say that at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Goldman could do to help small business, she said, is a kind of financing competition -- ''like a real-life version of Donald Trump's show.'' Goldman could invite entrepreneurs to submit business plans, coach them on presentation and finance the most impressive. ''If <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> were funding small businesses, who wouldn't want to be part of that?'' she asked. ''I know I would.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of Hispanic students who graduate from college in six years or less continues to lag behind that of white students, according to a new study of graduation figures at more than 600 colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, the American Enterprise Institute, a nonprofit research organization, examined graduation rates for students who entered college in 1999, 2000 and 2001, and found that 51 percent of those identified as Hispanic earned bachelor's degrees in six years or less, compared with 59 percent of white students.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers also found that Hispanic students trailed their white peers no matter how selective the colleges' admissions processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, at what the researchers considered the nation's most competitive colleges -- as a yardstick, they aggregated institutions using the same six categories as a popular guidebook, Barron's Profiles of American Colleges -- the institute calculated that nearly 83 percent of Hispanic students graduated, compared with 89 percent of white students. Among colleges identified as ''less competitive,'' the graduation rate for Hispanic students was 33.5 percent, compared with 40.5 percent for whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the report, sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, echoed a study prepared seven years ago by the Pew Hispanic Center. Using census data, it described how only 16 percent of Latino high school graduates earned a bachelor's degree by age 29, compared with 37 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 21 percent of African-Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like their counterparts at Pew, the American Enterprise Institute scholars found barriers of language and culture as impeding students from Hispanic backgrounds. The institute's researchers specifically noted that such students' ''familial and social ties to home are particularly strong,'' and that university administrators sometimes described white students as ''better prepared academically and financially for college.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a statement, Andrew P. Kelly, one of the lead authors, said, ''This data shows quite clearly that colleges and universities cannot place all of the blame on students for failing to graduate.'' (The researchers note one caveat: the federal data does not account for students who change colleges and then graduate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors cast their research as a cautionary tale for President Obama, who, they note, ''has called for the United States to reclaim its position as the nation with the highest concentration of adults with post-secondary degrees in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the changing demographics of the United States,'' the researchers write, ''this target cannot be achieved without increasing the rate at which Hispanic students obtain a college degree.'' (In employing the designation ''Hispanic,'' the researchers note they are following the lead of both the National Center for Education Statistics and the Census Bureau, from which they drew their raw data. The center defines Hispanic as people of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central American, South American or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study recommended that colleges adopt an ''institution-wide commitment to insuring that all their students graduate,'' that college counselors and others disseminate ''information about schools that have a successful track record with Hispanic students'' and that the government tie aid to colleges ''more closely to how well schools serve their students, not simply how many students they enroll.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALBANY -- New York will end the fiscal year on March 31 with at least $2 billion less in cash on hand than originally projected, the state's comptroller said Wednesday, burdening lawmakers with another headache and making the prospect of achieving a budget agreement before the next fiscal year begins even more dim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimate by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, adds half a billion dollars to Gov. David A. Paterson's own projection for the current shortfall, issued a little over a month ago. Mr. DiNapoli said the state could no longer count on two large infusions of cash that were expected by the end of the month: a $300 million fee from the winning bidder on the Aqueduct video-lottery franchise and $200 million from the coffers of the Battery Park City Authority.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aqueduct franchise was delayed last week when Mr. Paterson announced he was withdrawing support for the winning bidder, Aqueduct Entertainment Group, because the state's Lottery Division determined that it could not license some of the company's investors. Money from the Battery Park authority, which is controlled by the city and the state, have been held up by a dispute over the share of revenue each government is entitled to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, a tax amnesty program that was projected to take in $250 million by the end of the year has fallen far behind, bringing in just $2.1 million through the end of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This year's budget was seriously flawed,'' Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement. ''It was based on overly optimistic revenue assumptions and temporary revenue sources that pushed the problem into the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DiNapoli's announcement came as Mr. Paterson and members of the Legislature conceded that there was almost no chance they would complete negotiations for a new budget by April 1, when the new fiscal year begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To maintain New York's cash flow and prevent the state from ending the month in the red, Mr. Paterson is delaying by a few weeks income tax rebates for hundreds of thousands of taxpayers, a move that will save about $500 million in the short term. In the coming days, the administration will also have to identify an additional $1.5 billion in payments that will be delayed into the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I apologize that we had to do this,'' Mr. Paterson said Wednesday, speaking to reporters at the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan. ''I hope it serves notice on the public of how serious our financial situation is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the second time in recent months that the governor has been forced, in effect, to delay paying the state's bills. In December, when the state also faced a cash crunch, he delayed about $750 million in state school aid, prompting a lawsuit from local school officials and unions. That money was paid in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest batch of unpaid bills will essentially be rolled into next year's budget, forcing the state to begin the fiscal year in arrears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally serious is the state of budget negotiations with lawmakers, who in the coming weeks must close a total budget gap of at least $9 billion -- the $2 billion in unpaid bills from this year, plus a projected $7 billion gap for the new fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paterson met with the leaders of the Senate and Assembly on Tuesday but emerged with little movement toward a budget deal. His own budget proposal calls for steep cuts to education and health care spending, as well as new or increased taxes on cigarettes and sugared beverages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lawmakers have attacked that proposal. They have also criticized Mr. Paterson for withholding the income tax refunds and for not including in his budget any plan for property tax relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea being discussed in the Legislature is to refinance proceeds from the state's share of the nationwide tobacco settlement to take advantage of lower interest rates, generating a one-time infusion of cash. The Senate estimates that such a move could bring in about $500 million; the Assembly puts the figure at $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear, though, whether that refinancing could take place quickly enough for the state to get any money in time to help with the current budget problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so far, neither the Assembly nor the Senate has yet made any formal budget proposals of its own, reflecting the near-impossibility of closing the budget gap without large and politically painful spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're working round the clock,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''And they are gradually coming to the realization that we're going to have to make some drastic decisions. And that's a good sign that we'll have an effective result.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few moviegoers are as demanding as young readers confronted with a film adaptation of a book they love. The makers of the ''Harry Potter'' and ''Twilight'' franchises live in terror of the judgment of such audiences, who often demand literal fidelity to the text in question. The minor liberties and omissions of the recent movie version of ''The Lightning Thief'' provoked withering scorn, at least from a certain fifth grader I know. As for ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' -- let's just say that it's better that I went to the screening alone.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the movie, based on Jeff Kinney's popular series of schoolboy misadventures, departs egregiously from its source. The problem is that in dutifully transferring to the screen Mr. Kinney's comical episodes -- which he illustrates with witty and expressive line drawings -- the director, Thor Freudenthal (''Hotel for Dogs''), and the four credited screenwriters have stripped away nearly all the humor, insight and energy. The movie looks drab and drained of color, and can't even muster the antic buoyancy of an average episode of ''iCarly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The title character, Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon), chronicles his first year of middle school, taking note of the social anxieties and identity crises that pop up in that hostile and strange environment. At home, there is a scolding mother (Rachael Harris), a distracted dad (Steve Zahn), a mean older brother (Devon Bostick) and a nonverbal toddler, who all provide moments of predictable comedy. The main drama involves Greg's relationship with his best pal, Rowley (Robert Capron), a tubby, cheery fellow whom Greg rejects for being insufficiently cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing wrong with the story itself, but the tone is grating and the pacing sluggish. Episodes that might be howlingly funny on the page turn weirdly gross and sadistic on screen, though young viewers are unlikely to be upset or offended by the occasional bout of bullying or nose picking. They are more likely to be bored, which is much worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). Some rough incidents and crude humor.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What a difference hard times make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, most black discontent with the Obama administration -- especially in Barack Obama's hometown, Chicago -- was largely kept in the family and out of the mainstream press, even as black business, civil rights and political leaders quietly grappled with and debated how best to support and challenge the nation's first black president without hurting the causes of racial and economic justice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the economic crisis continues to slam black America disproportionately hard, while bonuses rain down on Wall Street, the debate has spilled into the open and will get its loudest and most public hearing yet on Saturday, in a forum held just a few miles from Mr. Obama's house in Kenwood, at Chicago State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tavis Smiley, an author and talk show host and a frequent -- and until recently rare -- black critic of the president, is scheduled to convene a panel of civil rights leaders and scholars called ''We Count: The Black Agenda Is the American Agenda.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussion will be nationally televised on <span class="companylink">C-Span</span>, and the invited panelists include Cornel West, a Princeton University professor; Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader; and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A black agenda is jobs, jobs, jobs, quality education, investment in infrastructure and strong democratic regulation of corporations,'' Dr. West said. ''The black agenda, at its best, looks at America from the vantage point of the least of thee and asks what's best for all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his run to the White House, voters, black and white, projected all sorts of hopes and dreams onto Mr. Obama, no matter what he said or did. When it comes to race, for example, Mr. Obama has forcefully tried to avoid the subject. The one notable exception was his now-famous speech in Philadelphia in 2008, and only then when his campaign was in peril from the fiery words of his former Chicago pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's black supporters were willing to give him a pass, to give him ''time to learn his way around the White House.'' But too many homes have been lost to foreclosure, too many fathers have lost jobs, too many mothers are losing hope for his most loyal bloc to be happy with what many are now saying is more symbolism than substance coming from Mr. Obama's administration in regard to black America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The question I hear a lot on the street is, 'Would we have been better off with Hillary Clinton?' '' said Hermene D. Hartman, publisher of the weekly N'Digo newspaper in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, though, like Jacky Grimshaw, a senior adviser to former Mayor Harold Washington, are reading more into the timing and location of the black agenda meeting 14 months into Mr. Obama's presidency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the idea is to embarrass the president,'' Ms. Grimshaw said, ''this is a good way of doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given Mr. Smiley's vocal criticism of Mr. Obama -- raising questions about the president's effectiveness in pursuing the agenda many black voters favor -- some see the meeting as a sign of a division among blacks here and across the country. On one side are those who believe Mr. Obama is doing his best under tough circumstances. On the other are those who feel let down by a perceived lack of action by Mr. Obama on behalf of black Americans. By hosting the forum in Chicago, Mr. Smiley seems to be spotlighting the discussion in a place most likely to draw national attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smiley said the goal of the event was not to attack or embarrass Mr. Obama in his Chicago backyard, but to pressure other black leaders to develop and press for a black agenda, an action plan for tackling poverty, poor schools, infant mortality and an unemployment rate among blacks that is at least twice the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Black people are getting crushed,'' Mr. Smiley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one argues that point. But since announcing the event last month, Mr. Smiley and the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Mr. Obama's most vocal supporters -- ''Barack's pet preacher,'' as one Chicago activist put it -- have conducted a sometimes heated debate on black radio about the wisdom of convening the ''We Count'' panel discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sharpton seems to have the numbers on his side. Support for Mr. Obama among black Americans is hovering around 90 percent in polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sharpton said he would not attend the Chicago gathering. ''Yes, we need a black agenda,'' he said. ''But the president shouldn't be leading it. Black leaders should be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herman Brewer, the acting president and chief executive of the Chicago Urban League, expects to attend, although with some trepidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's O.K. if folks are critical of the president,'' Mr. Brewer said. ''But I wouldn't want it to be viewed as a condemnation, a smackdown of the president. Hopefully, it can be viewed as constructive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Allen, a longtime civil rights advocate on the South Side, said that just a couple of months ago if he had made even a mild public criticism about Mr. Obama's not doing enough for the poor or for small businesses in the inner city, ''black middle class folks would curse me out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message was clear: If you are black, you just didn't air complaints about ''our homeboy,'' Mr. Allen said, certainly not in public where the news media could see and hear. Doing so was seen as undermining the first black president, of giving comfort to the enemy, of betraying the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, even in Chicago, Mr. Allen said: ''It's not as taboo anymore. You get cursed out a lot less.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some blacks in Chicago seem to be having a case of unrequited love.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He helped me carry a casket through the streets,'' Mr. Obadele said, referring to an antiviolence mock funeral. ''He absolutely understands the struggle of black folks. But he's not the same Barack I knew. The Barack I knew wouldn't bail out the banks and let the people go hungry. I think his advisers are giving him bad advice.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reprieve from a billion-dollar blunder proved all too brief for the Medicines Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Patent and Trademark Office on Friday again denied the company's request to extend the life of the patent protecting its main drug, the blood thinner Angiomax.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medicines has been trying since 2001 to undo an error, when it narrowly missed a 60-day deadline for requesting the patent extension. Because the patent office would not accept the late application, the patent has been scheduled to expire next Tuesday, rather than in late 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, however, a federal judge ordered the patent office to reconsider its rejection of the extension, suggesting the agency had been too strict in interpreting the law regarding the 60-day deadline. The judge, Claude M. Hilton of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., also told the patent office to keep the patent in force while it conducted its reconsideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday, however, the patent office had already concluded its review, telling the company that it would stick with its previous decisions and would not accept the company's application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision, and especially how rapidly it was made, stunned and infuriated the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I'm at war; this is very disconcerting,'' Clive A. Meanwell, the company's chief executive, said late Friday. ''It's not even polite, you know what I mean?'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patent office could not be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a 15-page decision, accompanied by more than 300 pages of attachments, it defended its decision. It said Medicines had waited until the last minute to file the fairly simple patent extension application. It also said the company did not sue the patent office until the patent had nearly expired, instead spending years lobbying Congress. ''MDCO's dire situation is therefore exclusively of its own making,'' it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meanwell said the company was considering its options, including going to court again. The company, based in Parsippany, N.J., has also been lobbying Congress for legislation that would allow the patent office to accept slightly late applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angiomax had about $400 million in sales last year, of which $383 million were in the United States. Sales of the drug account for virtually all the company's revenue. Medicines Company shares dropped 15 percent on Friday, to $7.88.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patent office did honor Judge Hilton's order to grant an interim patent extension while it deliberated. So the patent will now expire at the end of the day on May 23, instead of next Tuesday, March 23.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patent office on Thursday described this as a 60-day extension. It is actually 61 days -- sort of the same mistake the company made nine years ago. The patent office corrected its mistake the next day.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IOWA CITY -- President Obama on Thursday began an aggressive White House public relations blitz to sell his newly signed health care overhaul to a skeptical and sometimes confused public, calling the measure ''pro-jobs'' and ''pro-business'' and taunting Republicans who are vowing to repeal it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My attitude is, go for it!'' Mr. Obama declared, challenging his critics at a campaign-style rally here. ''If these congressmen in Washington want to come here to Iowa and tell small business owners that they plan to take away their tax credits and essentially raise their taxes, be my guest.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several thousand people turned out to hear the president speak at the University of Iowa Field House here, in the city where he first laid out detailed plans for ''affordable, universal health care in America'' as a presidential candidate in May 2007. But while the gymnasium was filled with cheering supporters, the president also faced heckling, over one feature of his initial proposal that did not make it into the law: a ''public option,'' or government-backed insurance plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What about the public option?'' a man called out, interrupting the president in an exchange that seemed momentarily to throw Mr. Obama off stride by forcing him to depart from the remarks he was reading off a TelePrompTer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's not in it!'' Mr. Obama called back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why not?'' the man replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because we couldn't get it through Congress, that's why,'' Mr. Obama said. The heckler started up again, and the president admonished him: ''There's no need to shout, young man, no need to shout. Thirty two people -- 32 million people are going to have health insurance because of this legislation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The choice of Iowa City as the first stop on Mr. Obama's health care victory lap was fraught with symbolism for the president; it was Iowa, of course, that thrust him into the spotlight when, improbably, he came out on top in the Democratic caucuses here. When he delivered his health care speech here in May 2007, he was facing criticism for lacking substance; his proposal made policy analysts sit up and take notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of you,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd on Thursday, ''this is the place where change began.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Obama must convince doubting Americans that the changes he wrought will make their lives better, not worse. And he must also give political cover to Democrats who may have risked their jobs to vote in favor of the bill. Mr. Obama is expected to campaign aggressively for some of those Democrats. Others who did not support the measure, and especially those who changed their votes from an initial yes to a final no, may find it tough to get campaign help from Mr. Obama in the midterm elections this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With polls showing the public still uncertain about the law, Mr. Obama will make a series of stops around the country in the coming weeks to tout its more popular provisions, including one allowing young people to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26, another barring insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing medical conditions, and one granting tax credits to help small businesses cover their workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Iowa City, with Republicans criticizing the measure as a burden on big business, Mr. Obama used his talk to zero in on the aid for smaller employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This year, millions of small-business owners will be eligible for tax credits that will help them cover the cost of insurance for their employees,'' Mr. Obama said, citing the experience of the Prairie Lights Bookstore in downtown Iowa City , which has been offering coverage to employees but is struggling with rising premiums. The local reference drew a roar from the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Starting today,'' Mr. Obama went on, ''small business owners can sit down at the end of the week, look at their expenses, and they can begin calculating how much money they're going to save. And maybe they can even use that savings to not only provide insurance but also create jobs. This health care tax credit is pro-jobs, it's pro-business, and it starts this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Washington, Republicans were spotlighting another provision that affects business: : the elimination of a subsidy provided to businesses for the purchase of prescription drugs for retirees and their families. The office of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, circulated an article from The Des Moines Register quoting officials of <span class="companylink">Deere &amp;Company</span>, Iowa's largest manufacturing employer, saying the bill would cost the company $150 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the Iowa Field House, a smattering of protesters were on hand to await the president. But so were supporters, with signs reading ''Thank You.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the public option, the plan Mr. Obama signed into law differs in several significant aspects from the one he unveiled here three years ago. Back then, Mr. Obama expected to cover 45 million uninsured Americans; the new law will cover 32 million. Mr. Obama did not envision a mandate requiring all Americans to purchase health insurance; that is one of the more contentious aspects of the new law. And the president's plan to pay for the bill entirely by rolling back his predecessor's tax cuts proved unfeasible; the new law includes an excise tax on high-cost insurance plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama, notably, did not touch on those differences in his speech here. But he did take Republicans to task for what he called ''fear-mongering and overheated rhetoric'' about the measure. Mocking his critics for referring to passage of the measure as ''Armageddon''the president departed from his prepared text.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So after I signed the bill, I looked around to see if there were any asteroids falling, some cracks opening up in the earth,'' the president said. ''Turned out it was a nice day. Birds were chirping, folks were strolling down the mall, people still had their doctors.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALBANY -- The districts represented by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and John L. Sampson, his fellow Democrat and the Senate leader, lie just a few miles apart in New York City. But when it comes to their priorities for the state budget, the two men inhabit different worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Silver took the microphone at a joint budget meeting on Friday, he emphasized the Assembly's determination to blunt the impact of budget cuts proposed by Gov. David A. Paterson, including steep cuts to health care, school aid and welfare grants. By contrast, Mr. Sampson dwelled on the needs of small businesses, the importance of job creation and the crushing burden of New York's property taxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understanding those differences -- a major reason why round-the-clock negotiations have yielded so little progress despite the looming April 1 deadline for a new budget -- requires examining the profoundly different political challenges each leader will face leading up to November, when every lawmaker in both chambers will be up for re-election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sampson, a Brooklyn Democrat, leads 32 Senate Democrats, a tissue-thin majority. Most of his members, like most of Mr. Silver's, are from safe districts in New York City. But the most vulnerable Senate Democrats are from places like Long Island, the North Country and Oneida County, occupying districts that were drawn for -- and until recently represented by -- Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should even one of those members lose without a Democratic pickup somewhere else, Mr. Sampson's majority will become a minority come January. And beyond the five boroughs, property taxes are the issue that most powerfully drives elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the highest local taxes in America,'' said Thomas R. Suozzi, the former Nassau County executive, who made reducing property taxes a hallmark of his political agenda but narrowly lost to a Republican last fall, stunning fellow Democrats. ''I think that the Senate Democrats are acutely aware of the potency of the property tax revolt that is taking place throughout the state, as evidenced by not only polling numbers, but also the results of recent elections -- including my own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder, then, that Senate Democrats are insisting that any budget agreement include property tax rebates, and reject nearly all of Mr. Paterson's proposals for new taxes and fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listen to the Senate Democrats talk about the budget, in fact, and they sound a lot like the Senate Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there's one thing that's clear about New Yorkers, it's that we can't tax our way out of this problem,'' Senator Eric Adams, a Brooklyn Democrat, said in an interview on Sunday. ''We don't want to do death by a thousand taxes -- taxing them on sodas, on cigarettes, on their income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans counter that Senate Democrats made similar noises about property tax relief last year, only to roll over when it came time to make a final budget deal. ''As far as action goes, the only thing they've done is take away the rebate check,'' said Scott Reif, a Senate Republican spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silver, who represents Lower Manhattan, labors under different constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His majority is so large -- Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Assembly by 106 to 42 -- that Republicans essentially pose no threat this fall. Unlike Mr. Sampson, who needs every vote to pass the budget, Mr. Silver can afford to let many of his own members vote against a budget deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That frees Mr. Silver, who survived a coup attempt a decade ago, to focus on the priorities of New York City Democrats who dominate the Assembly. And in the absence of a serious electoral threat from Republicans, traditional Democratic allies, like unions representing health care workers and public school teachers, drive the Assembly's political consensus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Assembly Democrats want to restore a large portion of Mr. Paterson's cuts in state aid to schools, health care providers, and New York City and pay for it chiefly with about $2 billion in new borrowing. When Mr. Silver talks about the budget, he sounds like a Democrat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need education. We can't afford to lose a generation in education,'' Mr. Silver said on Sunday. ''We can't just do it with a sledgehammer and hope that we don't hurt people in the process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what of the third party at the table -- Gov. David A. Paterson? Historically, governors, not Legislatures, have paid the political price for late budgets. Legislative leaders have often counted on that fact to draw governors to the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year is different. Mr. Paterson is not seeking election. A senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity, said on Sunday that Mr. Paterson had little to lose by waiting for the Legislature to come around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And serious spending cuts, the official said, are the only way to counter the splurges and accounting gimmicks that are at the root of New York's fiscal problems. ''If voters felt that Albany, for once, was being honest with them,'' the official said, ''maybe we wouldn't have to worry so much about being voted out of office.''</p>
