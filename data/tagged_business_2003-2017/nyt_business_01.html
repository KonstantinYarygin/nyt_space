PARIS, Dec. 31 -- Roberto Colaninno, the Italian entrepreneur who
engineered the hostile takeover of Telecom Italia four years ago, has
proposed to Fiat's creditor banks an ambitious $8 billion plan to rescue
the Fiat group, people involved in developing the plan said today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the proposal is still only in its broad outlines, it calls for
a group of investors led by Mr. Colaninno to put $2.5 billion to $3
billion into Fiat, with the company raising an additional $4 billion
through divestitures. The plan also envisions a swap with General
Motors, which owns 20 percent of the Fiat auto division, under which G.
M. would be released from a requirement that it acquire the 80 percent
it does not own, in exchange for G.M.'s joining a capital increase at
Fiat Auto.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If the Colaninno group is successful -- and that is far from certain
at this very early stage -- it would effectively mean that the Agnellis,
for more than a century the uncrowned industrial monarchs of Italy,
would at best have to share control of the Fiat conglomerate with other
Italian investors, most notably Mr. Colaninno.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The proposal, which was first reported on Monday on the Web site of
the Italian daily La Repubblica, has been outlined to Fiat's major
creditor banks, which concluded a $3 billion convertible loan
arrangement with Fiat in May, and to the government of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi, the people involved in developing the plan said. The
government was involved in recent talks with Fiat and its labor unions
to soften the impact of layoffs of more than 8,000 workers as Fiat's
auto unit tries an overhaul.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fiat, the largest private employer in Italy, has been struggling to
return its auto division to profitability. Fiat expects automobiles to
generate a $1.23 billion operating loss for 2002.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Monday, Mr. Berlusconi alluded to the plan at a year-end news
conference, telling reporters that ''there are groups of entrepreneurs
who have shown interest.'' Suggesting that General Motors has sought a
way out of its obligation to Fiat Auto, Mr. Berlusconi said, ''With the
decline in General Motors' interest, the government hopes for an
interest from Italian companies.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In March 2000, Fiat swapped 20 percent of Fiat Auto for a 6 percent
stake in G. M., and Fiat has the option to require General Motors to
acquire the remaining 80 percent, starting in 2004.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The people involved with the plan said Mr. Colaninno and his advisers
had not yet approached General Motors. It is also unclear what the
reaction of the Agnelli family, Fiat's biggest shareholder, would be.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fiat, and Mr. Colaninno, former chief executive of Olivetti, have
declined to comment on reports of the plan. But one Fiat executive said,
''Ultimately, it is all feasible.'' He added, ''There is one clear
point: Colaninno has the money.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last year, Pirelli, the Italian tire and cable company, teamed up
with an investment firm controlled by the Benetton clothing family to
buy 23 percent of Olivetti for $6 billion, giving the consortium
effective control of Telecom Italia, where Olivetti owned 54 percent.
The change in ownership forced out Mr. Colaninno, who had become chief
executive of both Olivetti and Telecom Italia after leading an investor
group that paid $30 billion to gain control of Telecom Italia in May
1999. The size of Mr. Colaninno's capital gain was never disclosed, but
it was considerable.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A rescue plan would come at a time when Fiat is particularly
vulnerable. Its shares have sunk to their lowest level in nearly two
decades because of its financial troubles. Last week, Moody's Investors
service cut the rating on $15 billion of Fiat debt to junk status.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The banks, thanks to their $3 billion financing package, ''own Fiat,
de facto,'' one person involved with the plan said, adding that ''they
are tantamount to being the biggest shareholders.'' The four largest
creditor banks are IntesaBci, Unicredito Italiano, Capitalia and
Sanpaolo IMI.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The banks have a problem,'' this person added. ''We say it is
better for everybody if Fiat puts money into the business.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fiat's chairman, Paolo Fresco, attended a board meeting in Milan
today of the investment bank Mediobanca, a meeting that was also
attended by Mr. Colaninno, also a director of Mediobanca. But the people
involved in the plan said other matters, not Fiat, were on the agenda.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Earlier this month, Mr. Fresco won a temporary lease on life when the
Fiat board thwarted an effort to unseat him. But increasing financial
troubles at Fiat and its auto unit are maintaining pressure for change.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the proposal, Mr. Colaninno and a group of fellow investors
would take the banks' liabilities into a new company. Additional money,
roughly $4 billion, would be raised by Fiat in a sale of assets. Mr.
Fresco has already said he plans to sell other assets, but those sales
have been going more slowly than expected. Earlier this month, Fiat
raised more than $1.6 billion by selling its stake in General Motors and
several lesser assets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The people said that General Motors would be offered a release from
the purchase requirement in exchange for a participation in the capital
increase for Fiat Auto. In all, the fresh capital for Fiat would total
roughly $8 billion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is unclear how G. M. would react to such a proposal. In October,
G. M.'s chief financial officer, John M. Devine, an outspoken critic of
the requirement, called a put option, , told analysts on a conference
call, ''If there's a change in control of Fiat S.p.A., then the put is
automatically eliminated.''

CLEAR evidence that dentistry is changing can be found in the
''dancing banana'' card in the current Henry Schein dental merchandise
catalog. One of about 50 easygoing cards offered for sale to dentists to
mail out to remind patients to come in for scheduled visits, the cartoon
features four bananas performing a line dance and the message, ''The
bunch of us wants to see you soon!''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because Americans get far fewer cavities than they did a generation
ago, thanks largely to fluoridation, dentists have had to become more
entrepreneurial to keep their practices humming. To keep pace, Henry
Schein, the Melville company that is one of the largest distributors of
health-care products and services in the world, has expanded, too.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although Schein's offerings run to items like syringes, ''bite into
this'' impression material and X-ray equipment, the company also offers
office management software and marketing aids, including 50 different
reminder cards, known as recall cards in the industry.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Selling supplies to doctors, dentists and veterinarians may not be a
glamorous business, but for Henry Schein it has been a highly profitable
one, particularly in recent years. The company has run up a string of
increasingly profitable quarters since going public in 1995; last year,
a dismal one for many companies, Schein's profits grew by about 18
percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last year, Schein clearly outpaced not only most of the big Long
Island companies but also benchmarks like the Nasdaq composite, the Dow
Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
Sales this year are expected to approach $3 billion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We think that all of our businesses are running on all four
cylinders,'' Stanley M. Bergman, the company's chairman, chief executive
and president, told Wall Street analysts during a November conference
call. ''Everything is working well.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One big reason things are working so well is Mr. Bergman himself. He
was the company's outside auditor before being recruited to run the
business, and he has transformed Schein into what Catalog Age, a trade
magazine, calls a ''world dominator.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Schein began as a retail drugstore in Woodside, Queens, in 1932. It
now has more than 6,500 employees around the world, including a
telephone marketing squad of 600, and has expanded into medical and
veterinary products, specializing in sales to individual practitioners
rather than to hospitals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Industry insiders give Mr. Bergman credit for his insistence on
technological innovation, for developing a database of customer
information and for hiring and developing a direct-sales team.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition to offering more than 80,000 individual items supplied by
industry vendors, the company under Mr. Bergman has expanded into
proprietary services like medical office design and has introduced a
line of office-management software.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Stan recognizes the way health care is changing and addresses his
customers as small business owners and entrepreneurs rather than only as
clinicians,'' said Suey Wong, who follows the company for Robert W.
Baird &amp; Company in Milwaukee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because it has integrated its acquisitions into one operation, Schein
is one of a very small number of health-care catalogs with complete
purchase histories on each customer, Diane Cyr wrote in Catalog Age's
November 1999 issue. ''Each time a doctor or a dentist buys a new
sterilizer, consults a financial analyst or has a chair repaired, Schein
knows about it,'' she wrote.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company's acquisition of the Sullivan Dental Company in Milwaukee
in 1997 made it the dominant distributor in the $4-billion-a-year North
American dental supplies industry, with about 40 percent of the market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''A lot of the smarter dentists now see themselves as small business
owners and are going beyond what we call the 'drill and fill'
business,'' Mr. Wong said. ''They're offering cosmetic dentistry such as
tooth whitening and want the latest equipment such as laser technology.
Schein is very strong in all these areas.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Selling supplies to dentists remains the company's core business,
although medical supplies are catching up. In 2001, the last year for
which information is available, the company's sales to dental practices
totaled $1.1 billion, or 43 percent of revenues; sales to doctors were
$929.8 million, or 36 percent. International sales (16 percent),
proprietary office management software (3 percent) and veterinary
supplies (2 percent) accounted for the rest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bergman believes that supplying dentists is a good business to be
in. ''The number of Americans aged 45 to 65 is going to double over the
next 20 years,'' he said. ''These are prime years for needing dental
work. And the number of Americans covered by dental policies is growing,
too.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the real growth potential is in medical sales, especially to
offices and clinics, in Mr. Bergman's view. ''The trend is for more and
more procedures to be performed in the physician's office rather than in
hospitals,'' he said. ''And our population is aging, which also suggests
there will be an increase in medical services.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Five years ago, medical products represented about 28 percent of the
company's total sales; in 2001, that figure had risen to 38 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bergman has also guided the company into expanded sales overseas,
particularly in Europe. Totals in 2001 were $398 million or about 16
percent of Schein's revenues. In 1995, when Mr. Bergman took over,
international sales totaled $108 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While some industry analysts expect that competition will catch up
with Mr. Bergman eventually, for the moment he can look in his rearview
mirror without undue concern.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Stan is a professorial, laid-back kind of guy, but he might be the
smartest businessman I know,'' Mr. Wong said. ''In the end, you judge an
executive by how the stock is doing. His is up fivefold over the past
two and a half years, in what's been a brutal market. The record speaks
for itself.''

FROM her desk at Mayfield, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park,
Calif., Julie Hanna Farris founded her first company in June. But she
did so from within one of the most coveted yet loosely defined
relationships possible with those who put up the money -- as an
entrepreneur in residence.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Such entrepreneurs, or E.I.R.'s, have a great arrangement. They base
themselves inside a venture capital firm for six months to a year,
review all the deals coming into the firm, gain a big-picture
perspective of industry trends, brainstorm with the firm's partners
about possible companies to create and tap into their expertise in
writing business plans. All of this comes with no previous obligation to
let the firm have a stake in the start-up, even though the firm is
paying the entrepreneur a stipend of about $10,000 a month. Often,
though, the firm agrees to invest.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''E.I.R.'' can also stand for executive in residence, as applied to
corporate managers who are brought in for their expertise and possible
elevation to chief executive of one of the venture firm's portfolio
companies. Sometimes a stint as either type is a step toward becoming a
venture capitalist. In any case, the position is prized.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It accelerates your ability to make progress,'' said Ms. Farris,
founder and chief executive of Scalix, a Linux business software company
that was financed in June after her seven-month residency and is
scheduled to open this year. ''If you are doing this on your own, it can
take 5 or 10 times as long.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unfortunately for entrepreneurs, they can't apply to become E.I.R.'s.
Venture firms pursue candidates, usually ones with specific sets of
qualifications and often with previous relationships to the firm,
sometimes as executives of portfolio companies. Moreover, the
invitations are few and far between. Mayfield, which has a high regard
for the strategy, has had only a dozen E.I.R.'s since the late 1980's.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The concept came into fashion about 15 years ago in Silicon Valley.
But even now, in a climate where business is wary of start-ups, many
venture capitalists say the idea is as relevant and effective as ever in
generating investment opportunities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Close to 30 to 50 percent of our projects start this way,'' said
Mark Saul, a general partner at Foundation Capital in Menlo Park. Since
he joined Foundation in 1999, he said, all three first-round start-up
investments he has made have resulted from E.I.R. programs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, Mr. Saul cautioned, starting an E.I.R. project must be done
just right. ''It requires a lot of general-partner involvement,'' he
said. ''When E.I.R.'s are left to their own devices, then you shouldn't
expect anything more than a random outcome.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Grant Heidrich, general partner at Mayfield, says the key is to
collaborate closely with the entrepreneur in writing a business plan.
The results are ''less risky than responding to a nicely packaged-up
deal that walks in off the street with a bright shiny team of smiling
faces,'' he said. But he cautioned that ''you couldn't invest your
entire fund with this strategy. It's enormously labor-intensive.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The flow of expertise, of course, is a two-way street. The
entrepreneur or executive in residence is often asked to evaluate
investment opportunities and to advise on improving the performance of
companies in the firm's portfolio. Ultimately, E.I.R.'s help firms
generate deals in-house.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''That's highly attractive for a venture fund, the ability to create
opportunity versus waiting for opportunity to come to me,'' said Joanna
Rees Gallanter, founder of Venture Strategy Partners in San Francisco.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
MOREOVER, if the E.I.R. develops an idea for a company into a viable
investment during the residency, the firm usually gets in on the ground
floor. ''We don't ask them to give us first dibs; it just happens that
way,'' said Irwin Federman, general partner at U.S. Venture Partners in
Menlo Park.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Venture capitalists began using E.I.R.'s as strategic partners in the
mid-1980's as a result of two trends, one technological and the other
financial, according to Andy Rachleff, who was a general partner at
Merrill, Pickard, Anderson &amp; Eyre in Menlo Park at the time. (He went on
to start his own firm, Benchmark Capital, also in Menlo Park, in 1995.)
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
First, computers suddenly made it possible to design prototypes of
products, making it unnecessary to finance the building of a physical
mock-up for market testing, he said. As a result, the emphasis in this
early financing period shifted to identifying exceptional entrepreneurs.
The process turned into ''figuring out where you wanted to create a
product and then having the confidence that the person could create it
-- as opposed to spending time creating a prototype and then showing it
to a bunch of customers to figure out if that's the right product,'' Mr.
Rachleff said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Second, as the amount of money managed by venture capital firms
soared, small investments -- say, $200,000 for a 30 percent stake in a
start-up -- no longer made much sense.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''By 1986, if we invested $100,000 and made 40 times our money on
that, it would have no impact on the performance of a $100 million fund,
because it would only be worth $4 million,'' he said. ''What we really
wanted was to make a $2- or $3-million investment and make 20 times our
money, which could really move the needle.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
E.I.R. programs now vary widely in expectations, duration, research
responsibilities, the degree of collaboration with partners and, of
course, success. But the relationship appears to always be nonbinding:
neither side is committed to entering into an investment deal with the
other.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Basically, it's: 'O.K., here's a desk. Here's a phone. Here's a
stipend. Think. Do,' '' said Danny Shader, chief executive of Good
Technology, a mobile communications company in Sunnyvale, Calif. He
joined the company after two tours of duty as an E.I.R, both joint
residencies with Benchmark and with Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.
Mr. Shader was named chief of Good Technology by the two firms, which
finance it. ''But they get to know you, while you are looking for the
great idea, which mitigates the people risk for them,'' he said, ''so
you have a better chance of getting funded if you are an E.I.R. than
not.''

An article and a front-page picture caption yesterday about a speech
by President Bush at a warehouse in St. Louis, where carbon labels
saying ''Made in China'' had been taped over, misstated the legend on
boxes depicted on a canvas backdrop. It read ''Made in U.S.A.,'' not
''Made in America.''

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 22 -- President Bush pushed his economic plan in an
important political swing state today, saying that it would benefit
America's small-business owners and that it was not a giveaway to the
rich.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Oh, sure, you hear the typical class warfare rhetoric, trying to
pit one group of people against another,'' Mr. Bush said in a frigid
warehouse of JS Logistics, a trucking company, where volunteers for the
White House used white stickers to cover the ''Made in China'' stamps.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''But lost in all the rhetoric,'' Mr. Bush said to the friendly crowd
of invited small-business owners bundled up in fur and leather gloves,
is that ''small businesses pay taxes at the individual income tax rate,
starting here with JS Logistics.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush said that his plan would help small business in two ways: by
reducing personal income tax rates on small business owners who include
their profits on their individual tax returns, and by tripling -- to
$75,000 -- the amount that small businesses could write off for the
purchase of new equipment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The best way to encourage job growth is to let companies like JS
keep more of their own money so they can invest in their business and
make it easier for somebody to find work,'' Mr. Bush said to
considerably stronger applause than the muted clapping that greeted his
opening remarks threatening military action against Iraq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush's trip was the latest assault in an aggressive campaign by
the White House to sell the president's $674 billion package of tax cuts
and welfare benefits that he announced in Chicago this month. The plan
has run into major objections from Republicans as well as Democrats in
Congress, whose approval is needed. Administration officials acknowledge
they have a difficult selling task in the months ahead.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush focused today on promoting his plan to a politically potent
group that is not usually associated with the richest Americans. A White
House fact sheet supplied to reporters today said nearly 40 percent of
small businesses are owned by women and close to 15 percent are owned by
members of minorities. Small businesses employ more than half the
private work force, the White House said, and create more than two out
of every three new jobs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The president said that his economic plan would provide an average
tax cut of $2,042 to 23 million small-business owners. ''Now, some will
say in Washington, of course, that's not much money,'' Mr. Bush said.
''It's a lot of money to somebody who has got two employees. It's a lot
of money to somebody making a decision whether or not to expand a
business. It's a lot of money.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's plan is the immediate elimination of
taxes on stock dividends, a provision the administration says would put
$364 billion in the hands of investors over the next decade. It is also
the part of the plan that has attracted the most political fire, and Mr.
Bush did not dwell on it today. Instead, he sounded favorite themes
about the robust entrepreneurial spirit in America.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Look right around you, right here in JS,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's
one of the things that makes us a great nation. There are thousands of
Americans from all walks of life who are realizing their dream of owning
their own business.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the day's planned focus on the economy, Mr. Bush opened his
remarks with a lengthy and impassioned case for action against Saddam
Hussein, making it sound as if war was imminent. Mr. Bush also
threatened Iraq's generals and soldiers with trials for war crimes if
they obeyed an order from Mr. Hussein to use weapons of mass destruction
''on our troops or on innocent lives within Iraq.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Before his speech, Mr. Bush met for 20 minutes with a group of 10
small-business owners and employees, now a standard for a Bush day trip.
As is almost always the case, the remarks from the group were
enthusiastically in support of the president.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When Mr. Bush offered them highlights of his tax-cut package and said
it would spur the economy, Greg Hantek, the co-owner of JS Logistics,
responded, ''It's kind of like preaching to the choir.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush smiled and said, ''Sometimes the choir needs redemption.''

LAST fall, Bert Brodsky, an information technology entrepreneur in
Port Washington, spiced up an otherwise staid legal conference in
Melville by lashing out against the newly imposed government guidelines
intended to change the way public companies are managed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stealing the show from a panel of legal and accounting experts, Mr.
Brodsky let loose with a colorful sermon against what he depicted as
unfair, unnecessary and ill-advised government intrusion into the market
as set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brodsky's caustic remarks brought howls of sympathetic laughter
from the audience but also suggested the sense that running a publicly
traded company in the post-Enron era was going to be substantially
different -- more difficult and more expensive -- than it had been not
too long ago, when the terms ''public offering'' and ''getting rich''
seemed synonymous.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brodsky said that between the depressed stock market and the
specter of increasing government monitoring, running a public company no
longer seemed desirable. At the time he was struggling to keep one of
his companies, Sandata, listed on the Nasdaq market, meanwhile exploring
ways to buy his way back into private control.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brodsky was not, and is not, alone. A combination of depressed
stock prices, auditing reform, new rules about the responsibilities of
directors and higher fees for legal services and insurance are pushing a
number of smaller Long Island companies to explore how they can buy
their businesses back from their shareholders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There is a lot of talk, much more than ever, about companies going
private,'' said Irvin Brum, the chairman of the corporate and securities
department at Ruskin Moscou Faltischek, the Uniondale law firm, and an
organizer of the conference Mr. Brodsky made into a bully pulpit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some of the reason is classic market economics. ''Management sees
that the company's shares are trading at 40 percent below their value
and tries to buy them back,'' Mr. Brum said. ''But a lot of it has to do
with Sarbanes-Oxley. If you're operating a public company now, your
costs are going up. Your accounting fees are going up. Your legal fees
are going up. You face a greater risk of liability.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Executives at thinly traded companies ''are throwing up their hands
and saying, 'This is just too difficult,' '' he said, adding, ''As a
result, a lot of people now are thinking about going private.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Nassau and Suffolk 113 companies were listed on Nasdaq in December
1996 as the market reached its peak, and now six years later, 64 remain,
a result of delistings, mergers and closings, as well as privatizations.
Nationally, the ranks of companies on the Nasdaq exchange have shrunk by
more than a third, from 5,556 in December 1996 to 3,663 last month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brodsky's experience was, in many ways, typical of company
founders who took their businesses public but remained at the helm,
riding the bull market and then suffering as the bottom fell out.
Through much of the spring, Mr. Brodsky sought to shore up Sandata's
sinking stock price as it edged closer to Nasdaq's minimum valuation
requirements. Then in July, with investors abandoning technology stocks
en masse and with industry profits sinking further, Nasdaq officials
told him that they planned to delist his company.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Brodsky challenged the action -- he contended that the market had
undervalued Sandata stock -- and promptly made an offer to buy out his
shareholders. Earlier this month, he succeeded; Sandata is now once
again a private company. Mr. Brodsky owns 70 percent, and his family
members and partners own the rest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other entrepreneurs are now looking at ways to shed the shareholders
they once courted and to escape the public scrutiny and additional
operating costs. On New Year's Eve Donald Sinkin, the top executive at
Disc Graphics, a printing company in Hauppauge, led an investment group
that took the company private.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another Long Island company is working with Ruskin Moscou on a
privatization deal, Mr. Brum said, but he added that it was too early to
name the company. (Announcements of privatization plans can inflate the
price of shares, so executives involved in buybacks usually avoid public
comment.)
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It often isn't easy being public. Many smaller companies complain
they are too closely scrutinized by analysts. ''The analysts are going
to pressure you to make projections about revenues and profits,'' said
Andrew Edson, who owns the public-relations company that bears his name
in Manhattan and Jericho. ''We counsel clients not to make
projections.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The reason is that when projections are wrong, even by small amounts,
public companies then have to hold lengthy public discussions explaining
any discrepancies, Mr. Edson said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In small-cap companies, where there may be no one who handles
investor relations, often it is the senior executive who ends up
discussing the company's performance with analysts, journalists and
others, sometimes diverting attention from other activities that would
have more direct financial benefits. On the other hand, brokerage firms
have cut back on the number of analysts tracking small-cap companies and
industry sectors that have been on the decline. Because many investors
rely on analysts' reports and recommendations, companies not followed by
analysts find it difficult to attract investors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The result is a Catch-22. The company is thinly traded, and so
analysts stay away; because analysts stay away, investors never hear
about the company. ''The major brokerage houses have cut back their
coverage of smaller companies,'' Mr. Edson said. ''They've dropped
coverage of hundreds, if not thousands of companies. It's becoming more
difficult to get a following.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Richard Lippe, a managing partner in Meltzer, Lippe, Goldstein &amp;
Schlissel, a law firm in Mineola, said that he thought much of the ire
directed by company founders against the Sarbanes-Oxley Act amounted to
posturing. ''The amount of extra cost entailed in compliance is being
exaggerated, and in fact many of the new expenses will also affect
private companies,'' said Mr. Lippe, who heads his firm's corporate and
technology group. ''In fact it's going to be much more expensive to
attract quality people as directors and to purchase insurance for them,
whether to a public company or private one.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But running a public company, Mr. Lippe admitted, is not for
everyone. ''You're constantly operating in a fishbowl,'' he said. ''Some
people get very, very wealthy. But psychologically, it isn't for
everyone.''

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 -- President Bush is planning a major initiative
to help small businesses obtain health insurance, but the proposal faces
opposition from consumer groups and governors because the insurance
would be largely exempt from state regulation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The proposal would allow small businesses to band together and buy
health insurance through a national trade association or professional
society. Through such arrangements, the White House says, small
employers could pool their buying power and negotiate lower premiums,
similar to those offered to large corporations.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, who supports the
proposal, explained the logic this way: ''If you purchase insurance as
an individual or as a very small business, it's like going into the
store and buying soda one can at a time. You can't get a very good
price.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More than half of all uninsured workers are either self-employed or
working in businesses with 50 or fewer employees, according to
government data.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Administration officials said today that Mr. Bush would announce his
proposal in the next two weeks, as he lays out his domestic priorities,
with an eye to the 2004 presidential campaign.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Congressional Budget Office says the new insurance plans could
reduce premiums for small businesses by an average of 13 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For years, small businesses have been lobbying for the opportunity to
form nationwide health plans, exempt from state insurance standards,
which they contend raise costs. They say their chances of success have
increased because Republicans control both houses of Congress. Health
costs are now the No. 1 concern for many small businesses, which have
experienced annual premium increases of 15 percent to 30 percent or more
in recent years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under President Bush's proposal, it would be much easier for trade
associations to establish and operate group health plans for members
with 50 or fewer employees. The new entities would be known as
''association health plans.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The president's proposal is strongly supported by likely sponsors of
the new health plans: the National Federation of Independent Business,
the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, the United States
Chamber of Commerce, the National Restaurant Association, the American
Farm Bureau Federation and the Associated Builders and Contractors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But state officials and consumer advocates express alarm. They say
Mr. Bush's proposal would destabilize the insurance market, leading to
higher premiums for small businesses that do not join association health
plans.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Four out of five workers in small firms, 20 million Americans,
would actually receive a rate increase,'' said Representative Earl
Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, a former president of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
State insurance regulators said they feared that some of the new
entities, shielded from state regulation, would become insolvent,
leaving millions of dollars in unpaid claims. In addition, they said,
consumers would be exposed to a significant new risk of insurance fraud
because the new entities would not be subject to state consumer
protection laws.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some of the state laws give consumers a right to appeal the denial of
their claims. Others require insurers to cover specific services like
maternity care, mammography, bone marrow transplants, mental health care
and treatment of alcoholism and drug abuse.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer
group, said: ''Association health plans will be able to manipulate their
benefit packages to attract healthier people and discourage sicker
people from joining. This will drive up costs for employees who remain
in the traditional insurance market. It may also lead some employers to
drop coverage.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Governors Association, the National Conference of State
Legislatures and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners all
oppose the president's idea.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At least 41 million Americans lack health insurance. The
Congressional Budget Office says that association health plans would
reduce the number of uninsured by 330,000. It predicts that 4.6 million
people would enroll in the new health plans, but it says that 4.3
million of them already have coverage from other sources.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, a major source of insurance for
individuals and small groups, are adamantly opposed to Mr. Bush's
proposal. ''It's a recipe for fraud,'' said Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior
vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. ''Small
employers will be giving millions of dollars to insurance companies that
are virtually unregulated.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, said the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans were
fighting the proposal because ''they don't want to be subject to
competition from association health plans.''

ALBANY, Jan. 27 -- Even as he announces plans this week to expand
some tax breaks for small businesses, Gov. George E. Pataki will propose
taking away at least one: a provision that allows business owners and
the self-employed to claim sizable deductions for buying giant sport
utility vehicles.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In his annual budget address on Wednesday, Governor Pataki will call
for closing what he calls a loophole that has let doctors, real estate
agents and others buy vehicles like Hummers and Ford Excursions, then
take a tax break intended mainly for farmers.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Eliminating this loophole is an issue of fairness and good
policy,'' Mr. Pataki said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The tax break applies to vehicles weighing more than 6,000 pounds
when fully loaded, like Hummers, a line of S.U.V.'s based on the Humvee
military transport. The law was intended to benefit small businesses
that used trucks and vans for farming, construction and hauling. The
Bush economic plan seeks to increase tax deductions for those who buy
the vehicles.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under Mr. Pataki's proposal, nonagricultural businesses in New York
that claim the deduction for such a passenger vehicle on their federal
tax returns would be required to restore the deduction to their state
income statements and pay the state tax on it, a spokeswoman for Mr.
Pataki said. The change could apply in the fiscal year that begins on
April 1, 2004, if the Legislature approves it, the spokeswoman, Lisa
Stoll, said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A small business owner, for example, who buys a Hummer H1 -- one of
the largest and most expensive S.U.V.'s, with a base sticker price of
$102,581 -- could claim the purchase as a deduction on his federal
income tax return. But under the new law, he would have to pay the state
tax on that amount, Mr. Pataki's aides said. That would mean an
additional $1,000 in state taxes, they said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Pataki's aides said that the proposal would raise up to $2
million a year in new revenue, a small amount for a state facing a $12
billion cumulative budget gap for this year and next.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But environmentalists cited other benefits, such as ending an
incentive for buying vehicles that burn more fuel and pollute more.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's encouraging people who would not normally buy these gas
guzzlers to buy them because it seems cheaper,'' said David Friedman, a
senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit
environmental group in Cambridge, Mass. ''It's increased our oil
dependence and the amount of money that small businesses are paying for

For seven years, Bill Ferrigno has run a profit-sharing program for
the half-dozen employees in his construction company in Connecticut. But
now, he says, he is probably going to shut it down, along with another
employee retirement program, because of the savings plans that President
Bush is proposing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Ferrigno's decision is bad news for the hundreds of financial
companies, from giants like Merrill Lynch to smaller companies with a
few hundred clients, that manage retirement plans for small businesses.
Financial experts say they expect many small-business owners to cancel
retirement plans if the administration's plans become law.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The new plans will be damaging to a large number of American
workers and to significant segments of business,'' said Robert
Greenstein, the executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a liberal research group. ''Businesses involved in setting
up and administering pension plans will lose out.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Those companies, along with insurance companies that face the loss of
their lucrative annuities business, will probably be the biggest losers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The administration has said the objective of its plans is to increase
savings and to simplify federal savings plans. A senior Treasury
official said yesterday that the expectation was that simplification
would lead to the creation of more employer retirement plans in small
businesses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But many pension experts argue that while corporations would probably
still offer retirement plans, the incentives for small businesses would
be sharply reduced. A boom is expected in the new kinds of savings plans
for big financial firms, which will more than make up for losses
resulting from the closing of pension plans at small businesses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Smaller financial management companies, with perhaps a few dozen or
even a few hundred small-business clients, are not so well insulated,
however. Michael E. Callahan, the president of Pentec Inc., a company in
Southington, Conn., that manages retirement plans for 1,000 small
businesses, said that if the new plans were adopted he expected to lose
so much business that ''I will probably have to close up shop.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under current rules, small-business owners are required to put a
percentage of their payrolls into accounts for their workers. Unless
they finance the employees accounts, they cannot receive benefits
themselves. But under the administration's new plans, many
small-business owners could put aside more for themselves than they can
now and not have to confront the expense of offering a plan for their
workers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pension experts said the administration's proposal calls for equal
company contributions to owners and workers alike. Mr. Ferrigno said he
regarded that as unfair. ''I'm the owner of the company,'' Mr. Ferrigno
said from his office in Avon, Conn. ''I make all the big decisions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I'm the big shot. You're Joe Blow. You work for me as a carpenter.
Your level of responsibility is significantly different than mine. So I
maintain that you should not get the same percentage as me. If they do
that to me, I will probably terminate the plan because there is really
no extra value or benefit to me.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Ferrigno's employees, along with all other Americans, could open
their own savings plans under the administration's proposal. But without
payroll deductions, most moderate- to low-income workers were unlikely
to contribute to their savings plans to the fullest, experts said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Without an employer plan that provides for incentives like matching
contributions and the convenience of payroll deductions,
moderate-income, small-business workers simply won't save,'' said Brian
H. Graff, the executive director of the American Society of Pension
Actuaries.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the administration's plan, insurance companies would have one
of the main tax advantages of annuity products wiped out. In contrast to
a mutual fund, taxes on the earnings in an annuity are deferred until
the money is withdrawn. Under the new plans, couples can invest up to
$30,000 a year with no taxes as the investment grows and with no taxes
due when the money is withdrawn.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''You'd have to be mentally challenged not to choose these new
plans,'' said Andrew Kligerman, an insurance analyst at Bear, Stearns.
''These plans will potentially make annuities obsolete for most
people.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even though variable annuities charge higher fees than most mutual
funds and carry hefty penalties for early withdrawals, they proved to be
successful for the insurance industry, with Americans investing $1.32
trillion in them, according to A.M. Best, the insurance rating agency.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Kligerman estimated that variable and fixed annuities, which
combine insurance and investments, produced about $190 billion in sales
for insurance companies last year, up from $30 billion 16 years earlier.
For Lincoln National, an industry leader, annuities account for about 40
percent of income, Mr. Kligerman estimated, and at Hartford Financial
Services, another big annuities seller, more than 25 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even facing billions in losses, the insurers are being careful not to
criticize an administration in which they find a great deal to admire.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We embrace the president's focus on retirement security,'' said
Frank Keating, the chief executive of the American Council of Life
Insurers. ''But we want to encourage people not to throw the baby out
with the bath water. The annuity is too good a savings product not to be
treated fairly.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a hearing at the Capitol on Wednesday on the budget,
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, the home
state for Hartford Financial, said she was ''very concerned with the
impact on the annuity industry.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Insurance companies might still find a sliver of opportunity in
annuities, however. Because annuities can provide a stream of payments
that continues until death, some people who have accumulated money in
the new plans might withdraw the money and put it into an annuity,
according to both Mr. Kligerman and Treasury officials. But Mr.
Kligerman added, it might be 5 or 10 years before that market developed.

FOR Andrew Beebe, the light bulb went off almost two years ago at a
computer technology conference in the Arizona desert. Mr. Beebe, who had
just sold his profitable Internet start-up and was wondering what to do
next, picked up a book on harnessing the sun's energy -- or, as he saw
it, ''how to hack photosynthesis.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the time, March 2001, the computer industry was suffering from
post-bubble shock and California was being racked by an electricity
crisis. The normally zealous attendees at the annual gathering seemed
dazed. After reading the book, Mr. Beebe, 31, was convinced that the
almost-within-grasp promise of solar-, biomass-, hydrogen- and
wind-generated power was ''the new new thing.'' After returning to San
Francisco, he became a partner at Clean Edge, a firm in Oakland, Calif.,
that is a consultant to energy start-ups.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Beebe's former company, BigStep, provided Internet services to
small businesses. Now he is one of several former Internet entrepreneurs
and professionals who over the last several months have quietly migrated
to the emerging field of alternative energy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With the threat of war in Iraq refocusing public attention on the
United States' dependence on oil from the Middle East, renewable energy
is regaining some of the buzz it had when Mr. Beebe was in diapers. It
is attracting the attention of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who
not long ago were dreaming of riches on the Internet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For now, the size of venture funds that are focused solely on energy
is relatively small. About $2 billion is available to invest -- as much
as in two good-size computer-focused funds. About $488 million of that
was actually invested in 2002. That is off from a peak of slightly more
than $1.2 billion in 2000 but up significantly from the early 90's, when
less than $25 million a year was being invested, says Nth Power, a
venture capital firm with a long history of energy investing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While interest is growing, enthusiasm has been tempered by the fact
that renewable energy -- particularly solar energy -- has been the
subject of optimistic pronouncements that have not always panned out.
And some people who are racing to start alternative-energy companies
once extolled the world-changing virtues of the Internet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As they race to commercialize fuel cells, wind farms and solar
panels, are Silicon Valley's whiz kids setting themselves up for another
fall, along with investors?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alternative energy, like the Internet a decade ago, is largely the
realm of arcane technology and technologists. The newcomers see an
opportunity to apply the formula they honed with the Web: take
technology with big market potential and add managerial talent and
venture capital. It remains to be seen, of course, whether that will
result in the equivalent of Webvan -- the Web-based grocery, a
multibillion-dollar Internet-era idea that vainly searched for a market
before going out of business -- or in something as wildly successful as
eBay.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The tech refugees are moving in,'' said Martin Lagod, managing
director of Firelake Capital Management, an investment firm that
specializes in energy, advanced materials and communications companies.
And he says that's a good thing. ''They are technically savvy, know how
to build companies and access capital,'' Mr. Lagod said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Investors who were burned by buying into highflying dot-coms may
think otherwise. And alternative energy, unlike the Internet, has a
history. High expectations for it were punctured in the early 1980's
when oil prices tumbled, making the new technologies uneconomic. With
oil prices still relatively low, adjusted for inflation, selling
alternatives like solar remains difficult.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Solar is sexy and everybody loves it, but the fact is it remains
too costly'' for anything but niche applications, said Stanley R. Bull,
director of research and development at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory, an Energy Department center in Golden, Colo. ''We get
concerned about overhyping some of these technologies.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the 1970's, when solar energy was first commercialized as a source
of heat for homes, promoters declared that the sun would also become a
mainstream and affordable source of electricity in just a few years.
Today, converting sunlight into electricity is still four times as
expensive as coal or gas power, though the price has come down to 20
cents to 30 cents a kilowatt-hour from $1 in 1980, and advocates say
technological advances will make it competitive with coal within a
decade.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More recently, fledgling energy companies that went public in the
last few years, like Capstone Turbine and Plug Power, have suffered
along with the rest of the market, or more so. Shares of Capstone, which
peaked at almost $100, can now be bought for less than $1; Plug Power,
which soared to $150 a share during the California crisis in 2001,
closed Friday at $5.05.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The outlook is uncertain. Deregulation, which should encourage the
use of alternative energy sources, has been set back by the Enron
debacle and market manipulation by traders during the California crisis.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Some of the hopes and expectations about how quickly energy would
be liberalized and how fast distributed generation would catch on have
been dampened,'' said Nicholas Parker, a longtime investor in
alternative energy and chairman of the Cleantech Venture Network, which
brings together so-called clean-technology entrepreneurs and investors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But advocates of alternative energy say things are different this
time.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Twenty years ago, a lot of the technology just wasn't ready,'' said
Dan W. Reicher, an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton
administration. He is now the executive vice president of Northern Power
Systems, an energy engineering company, and a partner at New Energy
Capital, which invests in alternative energy projects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today, he said, energy technology is more reliable and is often
backed by giants like General Electric, which bought Enron's wind power
business, and BP, which is pursuing several projects in solar energy,
wind power and alternative fuels like hydrogen.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Advances in biological and materials sciences could become
breakthroughs, advocates of alternative energy say. Most important, they
add, the economics of alternative energy are beginning to look
compelling.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wind power, the most developed renewable energy source, generates
electricity for around 4 cents a kilowatt-hour, putting it on par with
coal. Advances in solar technology, like so-called thin-film materials
that are being used in place of rigid silicon disks, may cut costs
significantly, people in the industry say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Biomass technology -- which takes organic materials, waste products
or gases trapped in the earth and turns them into fuel -- is already
widely used. It is attractive to companies like Cargill Dow -- which has
a biomass plant and is a joint venture of Cargill, the agriculture
conglomerate, and Dow Chemical -- because it also creates chemicals for
plastics, clothes or carpets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The market potential is certainly large. Electricity alone is the
third-largest industry in the United States, worth about $300 billion
annually. And of the two billion people in the world who the United
Nations estimates are without electric power, some may be candidates for
off-the-grid renewable sources of energy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Governments are helping to drive demand, which could spur innovation.
About 30 states encourage renewable energy; New York and California, for
example, require that 20 percent or more of their energy supplies come
from renewable sources in the next decade and a half. Mr. Reicher said,
''It's a convergence of technology, policy and market forces that make
clean energy such a terrific investment.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ENTREPRENEURS' and venture capitalists' enthusiasm for alternative
energy stems partly from the continuing slump in the computer and
telecom industries. ''There's nothing much else to look at,'' said Ivor
Frischknecht, a co-founder of Angara Database Systems of Palo Alto,
Calif. He is investigating opportunities to invest in clean technology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Venture capitalists are starting to follow the entrepreneurs into
this unfamiliar terrain -- with an estimated $90 billion in venture
capital idle, they are looking for places to invest it. Kleiner,
Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers, Silicon Valley's top venture fund, is
reviewing deals in energy and clean technology. Draper Fisher Jurvetson,
another well known venture firm, in October led a $13.5 million
investment in Konarka Technologies, a start-up in Lowell, Mass., that is
working on less-costly thin-film solar panels.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many entrepreneurs see in alternative energy that rare and desirable
condition -- a disruptive technology that could transform entire
industries, from energy to transportation. ''This is really the Internet
10 years ago,'' Mr. Beebe said. ''We're on the verge.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Such enthusiasm has been scarce since the bursting of the Internet
bubble also deflated entrepreneurs' big dreams. They might be advised to
be careful what they wish for.

Alternative energy sources have long been promoted as cleaner options to
fossil fuels. But their high cost relative to coal and oil have kept
them from catching on. As that gap narrows, investors are starting to

Spitzer said. ''He knowingly took millions of dollars from investors by
falsely representing his financing, his trade record and critical facts
about the deals.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Arraigned in Dutchess County Court, Mr. Zarro pleaded not guilty and
was released on a $500,000 bond. An assistant attorney general, Scott
Andersen, called Mr. Zarro a flight risk, but the defendant's lawyer,
Benedict S. Gullo Jr., said Mr. Zarro had surrendered his passport and
agreed to report monthly to a probation officer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
No trial date was set. The charges carry penalties of 10 to 30 years
in prison. Aside from his plea, Mr. Zarro made no statement in court and
left afterward without talking to reporters. Messages left at his home
in Vermont last night went unanswered.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Zarro, who grew up in the Bronx, twice declared bankruptcy in the
past decade -- a $20 million personal case in 1994 and a $10 million
corporate case in 1997, investigators said. He was disbarred in 2000 for
failing to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars in unused retainer
fees.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Spitzer said Mr. Zarro had defrauded 28 victims in a series of
real estate schemes that began in 1989. Using two corporations, American
Past Time Holdings and New Deal Projects, Mr. Zarro, sometimes with
partners, lured well-to-do investors with carefully prepared
propositions, Mr. Spitzer charged.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''He would lure these investors to make significant up-front payments
-- sometimes in the millions of dollars -- and then use that money to
support an extravagant lifestyle,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Zarro also used the money to enhance what the attorney general
called the illusion of legitimacy. ''Zarro rented office space in
Manhattan, used limousines for transportation and hired high-priced law
firms to create the appearance that he had the capacity to purchase
multimillion-dollar properties,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
State investigators said that, typically, the rent on the office was
not paid and the office would be abandoned after Mr. Zarro met with
prospective investors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Investors would later be told that the real estate deals had fallen
through and that their money had been lost, investigators said. While
Mr. Zarro kept most of the money, they said, some would be reinvested to
set up another victim.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In one case, a criminal complaint said Mr. Zarro got a $7.8 million
bridge loan in 1997 to buy the Segalla Country Club in Dutchess County.
It said he also got title to the club by agreeing to pay $14 million in
cash and saying falsely that he had a $9.6 million loan to get started.
Mr. Zarro, the indictment said, stole the country club and the loans to
acquire it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Zarro duped the Hudson Valley Philharmonic Orchestra of more than
$50,000, the indictment said, in a scheme in which he proposed a series
of summer concerts that would turn Amenia, N.Y., into another Tanglewood
or Wolf Trap. He burnished his credibility by saying he represented a
group that was bidding on the Washington Redskins. But the concerts were
a washout, and the orchestra sued to recover its losses after Mr. Zarro
refused to pay.

My 11-year-old son confessed to selling his completed homework to

cheating, but my husband finds it entrepreneurial. How should I handle
this family conflict?   R.E., New York
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Entrepreneurial? I suppose if your son pummeled his schoolmates until
they gave up their lunch money, your husband would call it ''aerobic.''
Both assertions are true but, ethically, beside the point. Does anyone
in the family really doubt that it's wrong to help classmates cheat, for
profit or pro bono?

Cheating is said to be rampant from college to high school (although
your 11-year-old does seem to be in an accelerated program). This does
not justify his actions, but it does make it difficult for you to
discourage him single-handedly from doing what many of his classmates
(i.e. customers) do. You must compel him to close up shop, of course,
but you should also enlist allies among other parents and encourage his
teachers to clarify -- firmly and vigorously -- for all students what
constitutes unacceptable behavior. That is, in addition to addressing
this as an individual problem, you would do well to combat the culture
that supports it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
You might also direct your son to honest jobs. Lawn mowing isn't as
lucrative as homework hustling, I suppose, but going straight has its
emotional rewards. As for your husband, make him read -- and write a
report on -- George Orwell's essay ''Politics and the English
Language.'' Entrepreneurial -- he cracks me up.

While hiking with our German shepherd in a New York State reserve, I
was told by a park ranger to put my dog on a leash. However, her hind
legs are crippled, and she uses a doggy wheelchair to get around. Wasn't
this blind adherence to rules and lacking common sense?   Tom Gorrian,
Upper Montclair, N.J.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Blind adherence to rules? I'm for it! No, wait, I'm against it. But
in the future, I'll have to ask you not to pose leading questions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unvarying enforcement of the leash law does spare rangers from
arguing with a series of dog owners, each insisting on the amiability of
his pet, from Peke to pit bull. But rangers should recognize those rare
cases when breaking a rule best serves its purpose -- making state parks
safe -- while making life easier for an unusual dog.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One guide to recognizing such circumstances is provided by the
turn-of-the-century philosopher John Dewey, who wrote, ''A moral
principle . . . is not a command to act or forbear acting in a given
way: it is a tool for analyzing a special situation, the right or wrong
being determined by the situation in its entirety, not by the rule as
such.'' Next time, recite this passage to the ranger; then sic your dog
on him. Its inability to lunge savagely will illustrate Dewey's idea
that the unthinking application of a rule isn't ethics; it's merely
heartless.

The biggest 9/11 program aiding small businesses in Lower Manhattan
has approved payments totaling $49 million more than the amount allotted
to the program, and state officials are scrambling to come up with the
extra money.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, business owners needing the money who were told as far
back as December that they would get it in three to five weeks, but did
not, are now being told to ''call back next month'' to find out when it
might be coming, a group representing such owners says.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One businessman, a locksmith and engraver whose shop was in the World
Trade Center, said he had been given this instruction in February, and
again earlier this month. The businessman, Seth Pehr, said that he was
told in late December that $23,000 would be coming in three to five
weeks. It was important, he said, because he needed it to buy a van from
which to operate, because he cannot afford to set up a new shop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A spokesman for the state agency running the program, the Empire
State Development Corporation, said on Monday that there had been a
surge of applications in the weeks before the Dec. 31 application
deadline for the program, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant
Program. The surge swelled grant-approval totals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By Monday, 14,233 companies had received grants totaling $530
million, or $49 million more than the $481 million that the agency had
established for the program, said the spokesman, Alex Dudley.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The agency, he said, expects that by the time it finishes the backlog
of several hundred applications, it will have approved grants totaling
about $561 million, which will mean $80 million more will be needed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said those numbers were signs of the program's success in reaching
out to small-business owners struggling in the wake of the terrorist
attack, and expressed confidence that ''everyone would get the money
they were promised'' from the program. ''And we understand sooner is
better than later,'' he added.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said that his agency was working to come up with a combination of
two possibilities: reallocating unused funds from its other 9/11
programs and seeking funds from another state agency, the Lower
Manhattan Development Corporation. That corporation got $2 billion of
the federal money allocated for rebuilding Lower Manhattan, while the
Empire State agency received $700 million for its own separate programs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is a subsidiary
of the Empire State corporation, any grant from Lower Manhattan to
Empire State requires the approval of the Lower Manhattan board and the
federal agency that granted the funds, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A spokeswoman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Nancy
Poderycki, said that if the Empire State Development Corporation asked
for more money, ''our board will review and seriously consider the
matter.'' She noted that last May her agency had approved giving $350
million to the Empire State agency, and that the federal agency had also
approved the move.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the agencies deal with aid in terms of hundreds of millions of
dollars, the ultimate recipients, like Mr. Pehr, just want to know when
they will get their relatively small pieces.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He is not alone. Mr. Dudley said that about 1,500 of the companies
approved for the small-business recovery grants had not received any
money, though many of them had been waiting a much shorter time than Mr.
Pehr because their applications had been approved more recently.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Pehr said the delay meant he continued to work using ''my car,
the subway, the taxi, whatever works,'' rather than being able to work
from a van.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I haven't gotten enough money either through insurance or
assistance to open another establishment,'' he said. When his shop,
Daniel Pehr Locksmith and Engraver, named for his father, was in the
trade center for 28 years, he said, ''I took the elevator, because 95
percent of my customer base came from there.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jeannine Chanes, a lawyer for From the Ground Up, a group
representing many Lower Manhattan small businesses seeking aid from 9/11
programs, said of the business recovery grant program, ''Every month,
approved applicants are being told to call back next month when there
might be money.'' She added, ''What we see is that there is a whole
amount of money out there but not in the right bucket.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Critics have also said that for many months last year the program was
too slow in reaching out to businesses in need, and that it never
provided enough for those that were in the trade center and lost
everything.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the program, businesses and nonprofit groups with fewer than
500 employees, located from 14th Street to the Battery, are eligible for
compensation for economic losses stemming from the terrorist attack.
Those that were in the trade center, or in other buildings nearby that
were so damaged that they could not reopen, are also eligible if they
certify that they will resume operations in the city within a year of
receiving a grant.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Grant size depends on location. Businesses and nonprofit groups that
were in the trade center or close to it are generally eligible for up to
25 days' worth of losses, to a maximum of $300,000. The smallest grants,
in the area from Houston to 14th Street, represent up to three days'
worth of losses, to a maximum of $50,000.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 20 -- Charities and community leaders here
reacted with dismay yesterday and braced for the possible loss of a big
donor and employer after the disclosure of accounting irregularities at
the hospital chain built by Richard M. Scrushy, this city's most
flamboyant entrepreneur.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because of the continuing criminal inquiry, Mr. Scrushy's assets have
been frozen. Meanwhile, his company, HealthSouth, could face bankruptcy
soon if it is not rescued by creditors.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
HealthSouth, which operates a chain of rehabilitation hospitals,
employs about 3,500 people in Birmingham, and any disruption in its
business would be a drag on the local economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''HealthSouth is a very significant presence both in terms of jobs
and economic impact,'' said Dave Adkison, president of the Birmingham
Regional Chamber of Commerce. ''The fact that the F.B.I. had to raid
HealthSouth obviously shocked a lot of us, but it wasn't totally
surprising because the problems there had been building for some time.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even before the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil
charges against Mr. Scrushy this week, saying he had overseen a
fraudulent scheme that allowed him to grow wealthy through the sale of
the company's stock, the commission had been looking into other
irregularities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The F.B.I., which filed a criminal complaint on Wednesday against
Weston Smith, HealthSouth's chief financial officer, disclosed last
month that it was investigating possible securities law violations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The difficulties at HealthSouth follow problems at another large
Birmingham company, McWane Inc., a manufacturer of cast-iron sewer and
water pipes that has been cited for more than 400 safety violations
since 1995.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For a city that had grown accustomed to Mr. Scrushy's public persona
in recent years, the disclosure of the problems at HealthSouth came as a
jolt. Mr. Scrushy (pronounced SCROO-shee) was known as much in
Birmingham for his extravagant tastes, which included a Hummer oversize
S.U.V., a luxurious Florida estate and a lead singing role in his own
country music band, as he was for his philanthropy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Many charities have had to deal with the issue of having
well-respected donors that didn't have the background you thought they
did,'' said John J. McMahon Jr., president of the board of trustees of
the University of Alabama. Mr. Scrushy was one of the university's main
donors, and he helped finance several endeavors, including a school for
health-related professions that bears his name.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There are not a lot of people here that have the capacity or desire
to be generous on that level,'' Mr. McMahon said in an interview. ''I'm
a long way from accepting that these charges are true because this is
already unfortunate for the entire community.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Outside HealthSouth's modern headquarters, nothing seemed out of the
ordinary, with construction of a state-of-the-art hospital in an
adjacent area to the company proceeding amid towering cranes. Joel C.
Gordon, named as interim chairman of the company after Mr. Scrushy was
placed on administrative leave, introduced himself to employees in an
afternoon speech.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
People close to Mr. Scrushy, a native of Selma, Ala., who attended
Jefferson State Community College before becoming a respiratory
therapist and businessman, also tried to understand how the large public
company he built could have been a fraud, as regulators and prosecutors
say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''He surrounded himself with strong, well-educated people,'' said
Karon Brooks, Mr. Scrushy's former wife, who remains on friendly terms
with him. ''He's rather preoccupied at the moment, but he holds up well.
He'll do everything he can to prove his innocence.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Others were not as sanguine about Mr. Scrushy's chances of emerging
from the accounting scandal. ''I'm shocked, but not surprised,'' said
Hope Launies, a makeup artist who worked as a personal shopper for
Leslie Scrushy, Mr. Scrushy's wife.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Their life was about as unhindered by reality as one could imagine,
and with freedom like that, comes the temptation to do anything you
want,'' Ms. Launies said in an interview.

SAN FRANCISCO -- THE topic at Rob Forbes's penthouse on Russian Hill
here was supposed to be furniture: to be exact, how Mr. Forbes was
planning to fill his converted ballroom atop a building from the 1920's.
Given Mr. Forbes's credentials -- he is founder of Design Within Reach,
the Internet and catalog retailer of modern furniture whose first New
York outlet opened on Saturday -- it seemed reasonable to expect that he
might turn his 2,200-square-foot apartment, bought at the end of last
year, into a high-design laboratory.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Mr. Forbes, 51, a potter with an M.B.A. from Stanford, explained
that he was concentrating on living in the apartment for a while and
absorbing its stunning view of skyscrapers, the Golden Gate and Bay
Bridges, sailboats and the distant green hills of Berkeley and Oakland.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Six weeks after he had moved in, the penthouse was still a little
bare, offering a mixture of ad hoc chic and bachelor-pad minimalism. Mr.
Forbes had installed some of his own vintage pieces (a small table and
chairs by Alvar Aalto, a bench by Hugh Acton and a pair of Pelican
chairs by the Danish designer Finn Juhl) and reproductions, including a
Noguchi sofa and a red table by Piero Lissoni.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''You know, I really like this place without anything in it,'' he
said. ''The space and the view are luxuries on their own.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Forbes and his partners take a decidedly more aggressive approach
to running Design Within Reach, which offers midcentury classics and
pieces by younger designers and has expanded rapidly since its founding.
Indeed, even as Design Within Reach continues its Web site (www.dwr.com[http://www.dwr.com/])
and its catalogs -- sending out more than 500,000 each month -- the
company has pursued an ambitious expansion into retail outlets over the
last 18 months. The 10th Design Within Reach store is a
3,500-square-foot split-level space on Wooster Street in Manhattan
designed by the architect Alberto Rivera, who also oversaw the company's
new studio in Beverly Hills. Another New York store, in the meatpacking
district, and two locations in Florida are also planned.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The stores represent a shift in strategy for a company founded as a
streamlined New Economy business in San Francisco in 1999, in the midst
of dot-com mania in the Bay Area. Wayne L. Badovinus, chief executive of
Design Within Reach, who met Mr. Forbes while both were working for
Williams-Sonoma, the housewares company, in the early 1980's, said they
had vowed that ''we weren't going into the bricks and mortar business.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Forbes said: ''It turns out that a lot of people just like
talking to people and the eye contact instead of filling in forms
online. For many people, the activity of shopping is a huge pleasure.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new Design Within Reach stores appear at a time Mr. Forbes's own
profile is rising. Last year he joined the executive board of the
International Design Conference in Aspen and served as a juror for
Cooper-Hewitt's national design awards and for I.D. magazine's annual
design review; he is an increasingly visible presence on the furniture
fair circuit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Design Within Reach catalog includes an ever-shifting cast of new
discoveries to go with its standbys by Ray and Charles Eames and
Philippe Starck, reflecting the fruits of Mr. Forbes's frequent research
trips. Jennifer Carpenter of Truck Product Architecture in New York said
that even when the company was developing its earliest furniture
designs, she hoped for a deal with Design Within Reach, as opposed to
bigger retailers. Truck Product signed an exclusive deal with the
company this year to carry two versions of its 2-Way table, which
features a powder-coated lacquer top and a reversible plywood base.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''My goal, absolutely, was Design Within Reach,'' said Ms. Carpenter.
''It's a well-edited collection, full of things that when I was
practicing as an architect, I would have specced for a job.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
What the company buys, she said, is news in the design world. ''I've
found that people read the catalog like a magazine,'' she said. ''And
every architect I know gets it.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Design Within Reach, whose original backers include Reed Business
Information, the publisher of Interior Design magazine, and Jesse Hansen
&amp; Co., a San Francisco equity firm, is privately held. Mr. Badovinus
declined to say if the company is profitable but confirmed that sales
have increased by at least 50 percent in each of the last three years,
to about $60 million in 2002.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite that growth, the move to New York is a risky one. Their DWR
Studio at 142 Wooster Street, near Prince Street, is already open; a
sister store is scheduled to open in May at 408 West 14th Street, near
Ninth Avenue and the new Vitra store. But Design Within Reach is
entering Manhattan in a sluggish economy and a war in Iraq and in the
wake of several recent signs of trouble in the furniture business.
Herman Miller Inc., based in Michigan, had a 34 percent drop in sales in
its 2002 fiscal year, and shuttered its modestly priced Herman Miller
Red line.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other casualties include the modern-furniture retailer Palazzetti,
which declared bankruptcy last month after 22 years in business, and
Full Upright Position, an online and catalog retailer that provided
early competition for Design Within Reach. Sergio Palazzetti, the
founder of the Palazzetti chain, worried about the chances of Design
Within Reach succeeding with retail outlets. ''They were successful
because they had no stores,'' he said, ''no overhead. There are problems
to opening a chain of stores and managing locations from a distance.
They're changing their formula.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are signs, meanwhile, that the revival of midcentury modernism
may be tapering off, replaced by a taste for more daring and eclecticism
in interior design.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's a really tough time in the industry,'' Mr. Forbes
acknowledged. ''But we think there's a healthy discipline in operating
in an economy where things don't come easily.'' He also suggested that a
retail niche big enough to drive an Airstream trailer through remains
between the mass market offerings of Ikea and Pottery Barn and
high-design boutiques like Moss and outlets of European manufacturers
like Kartell and Vitra. Or for that matter like Palazzetti.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even as it seeks a broader public profile with its retail outlets,
Design Within Reach is hoping to solidify its relationship with
professionals. This month it is introducing services under the Profile
name aimed at professional designers, architects and decorators, a group
the company estimates accounts for about half its sales. A new annual
catalog, called Profile Workbook, will offer more product details and
fewer glamour photographs of the furniture. It will be accompanied by a
second DWR Web site (www.dwrprofile.com[http://www.dwrprofile.com/]) and a chatty, tabloid-size
magazine, both of which are pitched to the trade. ''We think if we lose
that sense of direct connection with professionals, we diminish our
place in the market,'' Mr. Badovinus said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With its $3,795 sofas and $2,300 credenzas, Design Within Reach does
not exactly offer rock-bottom prices; indeed, some younger fans of the
company in California have nicknamed it DNQWR, for Design Not Quite
Within Reach. But the company's combination of competitive pricing and
ready-to-ship inventory has helped set it apart.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Keven Wilder, a retail consultant in Chicago, praised the company's
strategy. She drew a distinction between the old-school approach to
modern furniture, ''where you order it and put a chunk of money down and
you wait,'' and a new model, practiced by Design Within Reach, aimed at
a younger and less patient consumer. ''These days, especially if people
are ordering online, they want it right away,'' Ms. Wilder said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In its effort to sell classics of midcentury design at relatively low
prices, Design Within Reach has navigated some tricky byways of the
furniture business. One example is the steel and leather chair created
by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the German Pavilion at the 1929
International Exhibition in Barcelona.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Knoll, based in Pennsylvania, has been the licensed manufacturer of
the chair since 1948, and holds a trademark on the Barcelona name. But
the design itself reverted to the public domain more than five decades
ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturers argue that unlicensed versions of well-known designs
cost them millions in revenue each year. In 1998, Herman Miller sued
Palazzetti over a famous lounge chair and ottoman by Charles and Ray
Eames. A court ruled that Palazzetti could legally sell the chair, but
not under the Eames name. Design Within Reach sells a version of the
Mies Barcelona chair that is not manufactured by Knoll -- Mr. Forbes
says it is made in an Italian factory -- and sidesteps the trademark
issue by calling it the Pavilion chair. The Knoll Barcelona chair can
sell for $4,500 and take 12 to 14 weeks to be delivered. Design Within
Reach charges $1,995 for its Pavilion chair, and ships it within two to
four weeks from its warehouse in Union City, Calif.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We think people come to Knoll for that chair because we worked with
Mies and have been careful to conform to the original specifications,''
said Liz Needle, general manager of Knoll Studio. ''Is it frustrating
that people sometimes don't buy Knoll quality but think that's what
they're getting? Sure.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Forbes defends the craftsmanship of his company's Mies chair. He
adds that while he was unable to strike a deal with Knoll to carry its
products, he has done so with Herman Miller and other well-known
manufacturers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A weekly e-mail newsletter sent to 170,000 subscribers has helped
create Mr. Forbes's persona, which hovers somewhere between fan and
tastemaker. The electronic dispatches detail his trips to European
furniture fairs and architectural landmarks and his visits with
designers around the world. Last month, for example, he wrote about
chatting with the German lighting designer Ingo Maurer in an Italian
trattoria.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Badovinus, who maintains a low public profile compared with Mr.
Forbes, said that the company's customers had responded warmly to Mr.
Forbes and his efforts. ''Sometimes modern design can seem cold or
hard-edged,'' he said, ''and Rob helps soften that. In essence what he's
saying is, 'I'm a design enthusiast, you're a design enthusiast, and
isn't this stuff cool?' ''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That attitude was certainly on view in Mr. Forbes's apartment, where
he spent several minutes singing the praises of some of his favorite
possessions, the Aalto chair (''I love the way the back connects'') and
Acton bench (''See those feet on it, how they look like they're
walking?''), before heading into his bedroom.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A patchwork quilt, produced by a group of women in Gee's Bend, Ala.,
whose work was recently shown at the Whitney Museum, lay across the bed.
Almost neon-bright, it offered a jarring contrast to the Oriental carpet
on the floor. Mr. Forbes said he bought it from Odd Fellows Antiques, in
Maine. ''It's what an Amish quilt would look like if the Amish had more
sex,'' he said.

Prompting the latest dispute over whether government programs are
meeting Lower Manhattan's needs since Sept. 11, 2001, New York State's
economic development agency has sharply cut its estimate of how much it
will spend on a major incentives program for small businesses to stay in
the area or move there.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As recently as November, the agency, the Empire State Development
Corporation, said the program would probably cost $291 million, but a
spokesman said this week that the figure had been ''based on research we
did as the program was getting started'' a year ago. Now, he said, the
agency believes that the cost will be closer to $155 million, based on
how much it has so far committed to pay out: about $50 million to 820
applicants. That appears to meet the needs of eligible applicants, the
spokesman, Alex Dudley, said.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the cut in the spending projection drew a sharp reaction from
critics. They said that $50 million was too small a sum, and that it was
small because of overly strict rules that kept the program from
providing all the help needed to retain small businesses in Lower
Manhattan after the attack destroyed the World Trade Center and left the
area economically reeling.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The program, called the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant
program, began receiving applications in March 2002. The number of small
businesses that have applied to it is 1,261, Mr. Dudley said on Tuesday.
He said that 238 had been found ineligible and that 203 were awaiting
answers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The program is based in part on the date on which a company signs or
renews a lease in Lower Manhattan. The most common reason for the
rejections, Mr. Dudley said, is that the businesses fail to meet
requirements that their current leases expire no later than Dec. 31,
2004, and that they sign or have signed new or renewal leases after
Sept. 11, 2001, and no later than Dec. 31, 2004.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yet it is those requirements, the critics say, that unreasonably
exclude many small businesses in need and that have led the state agency
to reduce its projected spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is not the only dispute related to government responsiveness to
Lower Manhattan's needs as the area seeks to recover. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for example, while praised for its prompt
payment for the ground zero cleanup, has been criticized for the pace at
which it compensated people who suffered economically from 9/11.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Small Firm Attraction and Retention program is intended to help
businesses with up to 200 employees stay in the area below Canal Street
or move there.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Dudley maintained that the program was ''on track.'' His agency
says that in the last quarter of 2001 there were about 8,000 Lower
Manhattan businesses with up to 200 employees and that an estimated 10
percent renewed their leases annually, roughly approximating the 820
businesses whose applications have been approved since the program began
13 months ago. But Mr. Dudley said he did not have figures on how many
of the 820 had moved into Lower Manhattan from elsewhere.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A small-business group, From the Ground Up, which seeks to maximize
aid to struggling small companies in the area, says a study it
commissioned last year found nearly 13,000 businesses in the area with
up to 50 employees each, meaning an even larger number with up to 200.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I think it's left out a lot of people who are committed to staying
downtown,'' said Nancy Ploeger, president of the Manhattan Chamber of
Commerce.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jeannine Chanes, a lawyer for From the Ground Up, said the rules ''do
not take into account the economic realities'' of the small-business
needs in Lower Manhattan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Dudley replied, ''You have to make rules, otherwise you're
handing out money with no rhyme or reason.'' He said that the program
was succeeding, and that if more than $155 million -- its current
allocation -- was needed, his agency would try to get more money from
the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Empire
State that independently controls $1.3 billion in still uncommitted
federal funds for 9/11 aid efforts. ''We have every intention of paying
the accepted applicants,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The program provides $3,500 or $5,000 a worker to the qualifying
business, whose new or renewed leases are required to run at least five
years. The amount depends on a business's proximity to the trade center
site and where it relocates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One applicant who will not be paid is Dr. Grace Zaidman, owner of the
Broadway Family Dental Center at 287 Broadway. ''I received a letter
stating I was rejected because my lease terminates on Aug. 1, 2005,''
after the Dec. 31, 2004, cutoff.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Acceptance of her application, which was based on 11 employees, would
have meant close to $40,000 for her over 18 months, assuming the
employee number did not change.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Zaidman said the practice, which has been on the site for 18
years, badly needed the aid. ''Business is still 50 percent off,'' she
said, adding that ''481 of our patients died in the World Trade
Center.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Program officials have said a cutoff date was adopted because
incentives to keep business in Lower Manhattan or to add to business
there were seen as especially important.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another objection of critics, and even of some otherwise pleased
grant recipients, is the rule that in most cases half the total
commitment is to be paid when the new or renewal lease takes effect and
half 18 months later. The second payment could be larger or smaller,
depending on the number of employees at the time. The amount the program
has paid out so far is $27 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Carlos Gandia, owner of Greenwich Jewelers, which moved to 64 Trinity
Place in June 2002, after it could not return to its longtime Greenwich
Street location near the trade center site, said the $10,000 that his
four-employee shop had already received from the program in June had
been helpful.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''But 18 months is a long time,'' he said of the wait for the second
installment. ''You can really use it when you first come into a place.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Dudley, the spokesman for the Empire State Development
Corporation, said: ''We want to encourage not just a short-term
commitment. And if businesses grow their employees, they will be
eligible for more money in the second payment.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Richard Cohn, an owner of Southwest New York, a restaurant in the
World Financial Center across the street from the trade center site,
said he had no quarrel with the program's split payments. The restaurant
received about $200,000 as its first installment last summer, based on
having about 80 employees.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The program, Mr. Cohn said, shows that ''the government has gone
above and beyond in supporting the revitalization of downtown
businesses.''

TOKYO, April 8 -- Its arsenal of traditional tools rendered largely
ineffective, the Bank of Japan said today that it would consider taking
the unconventional step of buying corporate debt to make it easier for
small companies to borrow, and in the process battle deflation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by the central
bank's new governor, Toshihiko Fukui, responding to pressure from the
government to do more to shore up Japan's frail economy. In the month
since he took up the bank's top post, Mr. Fukui has demonstrated that he
is much more willing than his predecessor, Masaru Hayami, to work with
lawmakers and to tinker with the central bank's policies.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The bank concluded a two-day policy board meeting today, the first of
Mr. Fukui's tenure, without taking other steps on monetary policy. The
bank already sets short-term interest rates effectively at zero and has
been pumping extra liquidity into Japan's money markets in various ways
for many months, so there is little left in the standard central-bank
playbook for it to try.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, the announcement today focused new attention on the plight of
small companies in Japan, which have been particularly hard hit by the
five-year decline in consumer prices and which tend to be the first
customers cut off by banks that are retrenching to clean up their own
balance sheets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small business is a crucial constituency for the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, and lawmakers have often gone to great lengths to help
the sector. The government has offered loan guarantees for small
companies since 1998. It has also pushed the major commercial banks to
step up their small-business lending, with little success.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The central bank said it would consider closing the gap by buying
asset-backed securities issued by the banks, including some backed
specifically by commercial paper from small companies. Buying these
securities relieves the banks of some risk and frees up bank capital
that can then be put to use making new loans.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Typically, securitized loans in Japan have been backed by tangible
collateral assets like land and buildings. But property values have
fallen in Japan for 12 consecutive years, and commercial banks are
increasingly reluctant to lend against them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So the central bank's review will include a type of security common
in the United States but not often seen in Japan: one backed by bundles
of loans and receivables.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Though the central bank already accepts asset-backed securities as
collateral, the ''outright purchase of private debt is an unprecedented
measure for a central bank,'' the Bank of Japan said in a statement. The
bank's staff is to work out details for the board to discuss at its next
meeting in May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wary of wrecking its own balance sheet by taking on risky assets, the
central bank said that it would consider buying the asset-backed
securities only as a temporary measure. Still, it would be a big step
away from the conservatism of Mr. Hayami's tenure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The careful wording of the central bank's announcement is a sign of
the political tightrope Mr. Fukui walks. As a longtime central banker,
he wants to preserve the bank's independence and maintain continuity
with past policies. But he must also face the glum realities of Japan's
12-year economic slide and appease the politicians, including Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who named him.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Today's move is a kind of Band-Aid,'' said Akio Makabe, an
economist at the Mizuho Research Institute. ''But Fukui is in a very
difficult situation; he has to do something quickly.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Several economists said that even if the bank decided to go ahead
with the proposed debt purchases, that would only patch over a few of
the sorest parts of the economy, not solve its broader problems. The
most important question now, Mr. Makabe said, is whether the government
will respond by announcing new measures to stimulate the economy, or use
the bank's move as an excuse to do nothing. Recent history suggests that
the latter is more likely.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In fact, leading ruling-party lawmakers are pressing Mr. Koizumi's
administration to roll back some of the measures it has already taken to
try to bring Japan's financial system up to global standards.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 -- Two Silicon Valley start-ups plan to
introduce products on Wednesday that they say will make it less
expensive for Internet and telephone companies to route their data
traffic.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The products from Procket Networks, based in Milpitas, and Caspian
Networks, with headquarters in San Jose, are intended to compete in the
router business, a roughly $1.4 billion market dominated by Cisco
Systems and Juniper Networks.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Both Procket Networks and Caspian Networks have piqued the interest
of technology industry analysts who say the companies have the potential
to take market share from Cisco and Juniper.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The companies have completely different takes on the market, but
they both have the ability to penetrate,'' said Stephen Kamman, a data
networking analyst with CIBC World Markets in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He added, ''It'll take 12 to 18 months to know whether they have made
any impact.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Randall Kruep, chief executive of Procket Networks, said the company
had been operating in ''stealth mode'' for three and a half years. But
he said the company would announce on Wednesday new customers, including
NTT/Verio Inc., an Internet service provider.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Kruep, a former Cisco employee, said Procket Networks had raised
$272 million in financing and employs a lot of people from Cisco and
Juniper.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said the company planned to offer routers that are 40 percent to
60 percent less expensive than those offered by the competition.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Caspian Networks said it had raised $262 million in capital and on
Wednesday will announce the commercial availability of its new router,
the Apeiro. Dallas Kachan, marketing director for Caspian, said the
router was created to give service providers greater control over the
flow of data. In particular, he said, the routers are designed to
guarantee that traffic deemed a high priority will make it through the
network first.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Kamman of CIBC said that the emergence of the two companies might
be an indication that telecommunications companies were ready to invest
again on their infrastructure, at least in a limited way. That Caspian
and Procket have gained early interest suggests the market is not as
stagnant as it has been for the last two years, he said.

THREE years ago, Randice-Lisa Altschul was a celebrated entrepreneur
and media darling. Her most recent invention -- a disposable cellphone
--caught the attention of the BBC, CNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, Parade,
Glamour, Business Week and The Financial Times of London, all of which
interviewed her. She was invited, twice, to lecture at Harvard Business
School.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today, Ms. Altschul's company, Dieceland Technologies, is $2.3
million in the red and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
January. And she is being sued by creditors for control of her patents.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Other people might go get drunk and cry in their beer,'' Ms.
Altschul said. ''But that's not my style.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Her style is, rather, to come out swinging. Last month, Ms. Altschul
self-published a memoir, ''Financiers, Lawyers, and Other Assorted
Snakes: An Entrepreneur's Story,'' which lambastes what she says are the
feckless lawyers and fiendish financiers who contributed to her
financial demise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Altschhul's salty narrative is a road map for inventors looking
to bring a product to market. She details what she did right (patented
broadly and deeply) and what she did wrong (trusted unscrupulous
advisers).
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Independent inventors, of course, are notoriously paranoid. But, if
Ms. Altschul's account is to be believed, just because you're paranoid
does not mean they're not out to get you.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
During the initial press frenzy over her invention, she says in her
ruminative account, a representative from a large talent agency called,
offering to put her in touch with the ''power brokers of power
brokers.'' That person turned out to be a financier whom Ms. Altschul
calls Dick, who becomes the main villain in her saga. (Under
instructions from her lawyers, she used pseudonyms for most of the
players.)
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In January 2001, she said, ''Dick'' flew in a private plane to meet
Ms. Altschul in Texas, where she had flown from her home in Cliffside
Park, N.J. While pitching himself to her, she said, ''Dick'' revealed
that years earlier he had had a brush with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. But he dismissed it as it as a minor incident, Ms. Altschul
recalls.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And Ms. Altschul said she was in no position to be picky. A
successful toy inventor who had licensed toys like Bendy Wendy, a
bendable doll, she had bet ''the farm'' on her cellphone ideas. On Nov.
8, 1999 -- the day The New York Times ran the first article on her
cellphone patent, which helped attract subsequent media coverage and
investors -- Ms. Altschul had maxed out 35 credit cards and owed a
couple of hundred thousand dollars to family and friends.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
According to her company's bankruptcy papers, the man she calls Dick
in the book did line up some impressive investors: Harold Snyder, a
generic drug manufacturer, invested $100,000, and Robert D. Hormats,
vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, put in $75,000 of his own
money.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But that was the extent of ''Dick's'' help, according to Ms.
Altschul. She says he and his associates cost the company $200,000 -- in
addition to $300,000 spent on worthless prototypes, tens of thousands
squandered on questionable legal fees and $400 lunches -- and mishandled
a funding deal with J. P. Morgan and a distribution deal with General
Electric. This happened while Ms. Altschul was both trying to care for
her mother, who was dying of a brain tumor, and watch over her father,
who was suffering from dementia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Could the financier be Dennis B. Levine, who, as a former broker at
Drexel Burnham Lambert, spent two years in prison for feeding inside
information to Ivan F. Boesky, the infamous arbitrager of the 1980's?
Yes, according to people who have worked on the lawsuit against Ms.
Altschul. The Dieceland bankruptcy filing lists a Dennis Levine as the
company's financial consultant. Mr. Levine did not respond to phone
messages.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Altschul said she would be unable to reveal any real names until
current litigation is resolved, but even she admits that ''all you have
to do is look at the public records to figure out who is who.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Like most entrepreneurs, Ms. Altschul is highly resilient. She is
already starting several new ventures, including beyondbitch.com, an
Internet site where players rate the merits of other players' diatribes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But her main money-making plan these days is her book. Ms. Altschul
is hoping to earn enough from sales to pay back creditors and thus
retain control of her phone patents.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Altschul's memoir (which, potential readers should be warned,
could benefit from a vigorous editorial scrubbing) is printed by Kinko's
and sold online for $19.95 plus shipping at
www.assortedsnakes.com[http://www.assortedsnakes.com/]. She
figures that all she has to do is sell 200,000 copies. Kristine Puopolo,
a senior editor at Broadway Books, sees that as wildly ambitious: some
books become best sellers having sold only one-tenth that number. But
Ms. Altschul seems undeterred.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''So far I've already sold 1,000,'' Ms. Altschul says brightly.
''Only 199,000 to go.''

MARTIN PICHINSON is one of Silicon Valley's undertakers. His company,
Sherwood Partners, has carved out a prosperous niche as an expert in
shutting down failed technology start-ups on behalf of venture capital
firms and other disenchanted investors. And, this summer, he plans to
move his company's headquarters to Palo Alto, Calif., the heartland of
opportunity for his rapidly growing business.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Pichinson, 57, does not always bury companies. Some can be
rehabilitated or sold off. But Sherwood Partners has shut down 150
once-aspiring start-ups in the last two years, and Mr. Pichinson figures
that thousands more are destined to fold. His company stands ready to
help things along.
</p>

''We're doctors of reality,'' said Mr. Pichinson, who began his
business career in the garment industry. ''You don't have to have a
Harvard M.B.A. to know that more money has to come in than go out.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The winnowing of the corporate population is just one sign that the
information technology industry is maturing in ways that will affect
technology companies, their customers and investors for years to come.
But what's painful for Silicon Valley is beneficial for those who use
the stuff it produces.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The industry, according to Irving Wladawsky-Berger, a strategy
executive at I.B.M., has entered ''the post-technology era.'' It is not
that technology itself no longer matters, he explained. Instead, he
said, the steady advances in chips, disk storage and software mean that
the focus is no longer on the technology itself -- with its arcane
language of processing speeds and gigabytes -- but on what people and
companies can do with it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As a result, industry executives and analysts say, the balance of
power is shifting away from technology suppliers and toward their
corporate customers. At the same time, the use of lower-cost building
blocks of computer hardware and software is spreading, making it easier
for companies and individuals to share data and work together using
industry standards rather than remain dependent on one or two main
suppliers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
These trends, they say, point to increased pressure on prices and
profits for most technology companies, a good deal for corporate
customers and a very tricky time for investors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This is more than a backlash against the bubble years, or a mere
pendulum swing in attitudes and practices. The technology itself will
still deliver waves of innovation in the future. Yet an industry that
has risen to account for 10 percent of the economy and nearly 60 percent
of business capital spending can no longer play by its own rules.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I don't see a loss of faith in technology, but gravity has been
turned back on,'' said Dick Lampman, the director of Hewlett-Packard's
research laboratories.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yet an article published last week in The Harvard Business Review
does question corporate America's faith in the value of technology.
Titled ''IT Doesn't Matter,'' the article argues that information
technology is inevitably headed in the same direction as the railroads,
the telegraph, electricity and the internal combustion engine.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All of these industrial technologies aged from their boom-time youth
to become, in economic terms, ordinary factors of production, or
''commodity inputs,'' the article noted. ''From a strategic standpoint,
they became invisible; they no longer mattered,'' wrote Nicholas G.
Carr, editor at large of The Harvard Business Review. ''That is exactly
what is happening to information technology today.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most corporate executives, however, still think there is a lot they
can do with technology to give them an edge. Glen Salow, the chief
information officer of the American Express Company, sees the recent
trends in the industry as working to his advantage. First, he said, the
hard times in the technology business have increasingly meant that big
corporate customers hold the upper hand in their dealings with
suppliers. That shift, Mr. Salow added, has given him not only more
bargaining power on price, but also more influence in the products and
services that are developed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Corporate customers want to use technology to achieve goals like
cutting costs, improving customer service and speeding the pace of
bringing new products to market. But in the past, the computer industry
has often treated customers with a certain arrogance, selling raw
technology, take it or leave it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
MR. SALOW recalled a conversation he had in the late 1990's with the
chief executive of a major computer company, whom he declined to
identify. As Mr. Salow recalled, the computer executive told him, ''My
job is to make the hottest box on earth and deliver it on your loading
dock.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''You don't hear that kind of talk anymore from him or anyone else,''
he said. ''There has been a huge change from that perspective. The voice
of the customer is being heard.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Corporate customers are insisting that technology companies adopt
industry-standard software formats and communications protocols, so that
the many different kinds of computer systems in corporate data centers
can work together. In doing so, the companies are encouraging a
technology trend that was really kicked off by the Internet, with its
global reach that connects all sorts of technologies. For the Internet
to work, the computer plumbing had to cooperate. And hardware and
software standards make it more difficult for technology companies to
''lock in'' customers to their more expensive, homegrown technology
offerings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With their new power, customers are also pressing for greater
flexibility in how they buy computing resources -- especially as a
utility-style service in which they pay only for as much as they use, as
if they were buying electricity. Mr. Salow signed a utility pricing and
outsourcing deal with I.B.M. last year, in which 1,500 technology
workers were transferred to I.B.M. The arrangement, he explained,
reduces fixed technology expenses, giving American Express more
flexibility.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The widespread use of software standards, Mr. Salow added, enables
the thousands of internal programmers at American Express to build new
applications almost as if snapping together Lego blocks, reducing the
amount of code that has to be written by hand. A result, he said, is
that the software for, say, a new credit card offering or a
fraud-detection feature can be built and put into use in about two
weeks; five years ago, this might have taken six months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It all frees you up to take more gambles because each risk is not
so costly and you can move a lot faster,'' Mr. Salow said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Several big companies besides I.B.M. -- including Hewlett-Packard,
Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, Oracle and Veritas -- are moving to utility
computing. But Salesforce.com was founded in 1999 specifically to
capitalize on the trend. It sells sales-force automation software over
the Internet; users with a standard Web browser get access to it for a
monthly fee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Marc R. Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com,
regards his company as a force for change in an industry that he says is
still mired in the ''preutility era.'' In the future, Mr. Benioff said,
''the risk and complexity of computing should shift to the utility.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Benioff's message and his low-cost, no-frills offering have gone
over well at a time when companies are squeezing technology budgets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Salesforce.com expects its revenue to about double this year, to $100
million. The company has started with sales-force automation, a software
market where Siebel Systems is the leader.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yet Mr. Benioff has ambitious plans to move into other big software
markets where companies like SAP, PeopleSoft and others sell software
for managing manufacturing, planning, human resources and other
operations for large corporations. These big, complex ''enterprise''
software systems can cost millions of dollars and take several months or
years to install and use.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I think there is going to be a huge democratization of these
enterprise technologies because of this on-demand computing enabled by
the Internet,'' Mr. Benioff said. ''Our evangelical mission is to
destroy enterprise software as it exists today.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE push toward utility computing, according to Mr. Wladawsky-Berger
of I.B.M., fits neatly into his concept of a post-technology era. ''In
the last few years,'' he said, ''the underlying components have become
so powerful, reliable and inexpensive that you don't have to worry so
much about the underlying engine, and you can move up to higher-level
concerns.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
I.B.M. has moved more and more toward becoming a provider not only of
technology, but also of business expertise in 17 industries from banking
to electronics and transportation. Its $3.5 billion purchase of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting last year was a step toward that goal.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Wladawsky-Berger is in charge of guiding that strategy, which
I.B.M. is promoting as ''on-demand computing.'' The on-demand concept
represents a maturing of computing in a sense, he said, but more as
''the next evolutionary step in information technology, where the fun
really begins'' rather than an aging industry in decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Each successive wave of computing -- from mainframes to minicomputers
to personal computers to the Internet -- has opened the door to new
users and created new problems. Each of those, in turn, must be
addressed if the industry is to move ahead. The Internet brought an
explosion of computing complexity. And while many dot-coms are gone,
Internet technology has spread widely, becoming a mainstream technology
in corporations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape Communications, whose
software introduced Web browsing to millions and touched off the
Internet boom, is now chairman of Opsware, whose data-center software is
intended to tackle the complexity crisis. ''At Netscape, we were
building all the software components that made this possible and created
the problem, and we didn't grasp the implications,'' said Mr.
Andreessen, who is 31.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Sun have also begun major
efforts to address the complexity problem with automated management
tools that can replace people. But analysts say there is also room for
innovative start-ups like Opsware.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''At the same time there is this relentless cost-cutting, there is
also a lot of excitement about this market for tools to cope with the
complexity conundrum, where a boatload of computer science is going to
have to move into the corporate mainstream,'' said Mark Stahlman, an
independent industry analyst.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Roger McNamee has been a professional investor in technology
companies for more than two decades, starting as an analyst at T. Rowe
Price. In 1991, backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the venture
capital firm, Mr. McNamee became a co-founder of Integral Capital
Partners, a so-called crossover fund investing in start-ups as well as
fast-growing public companies. Integral Capital thrived in the 1990's.
But late in the decade, Mr. McNamee said he and his partners became
''really concerned about how wacky the market had become.'' In the
second half of 1999, at the peak of the bubble, Integral returned $1.5
billion to investors in its main fund.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 1999, Mr. McNamee and three colleagues founded Silver Lake
Partners to invest in mature companies. Silver Lake quickly raised $2.3
billion from institutional investors and wealthy individuals, including
three of technology's best-known billionaires, Bill Gates, Lawrence J.
Ellison and Michael Dell. Silver Lake's strategy is to make longer-term
investments, taking a five-year perspective, of $250 million or so in
each company. ''We're looking mostly for winners in consolidating
industries,'' Mr. McNamee explained. ''This is a period of thinning the
herd.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And once the downturn is over, Mr. McNamee is skeptical that spending
on technology will ever return to its long-term trend, dating back to
the 1960's, of increasing at two to three times the growth rate of the
economy. So, he said, broad-based technology funds are probably a
formula for losing money. ''This is absolutely a stock-picker's
environment,'' Mr. McNamee observed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For its part, Silver Lake is betting that the corporate winners will
include Flextronics, a contract manufacturer of computers, cellphones
and other products; Seagate Technology, a disk drive maker; Gartner
Inc., the technology research firm; and Ameritrade, the online broker.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of Silver Lake's investors, Mr. Ellison, the chairman of Oracle,
has been one of the most vocal proponents of the view that the
technology industry is graying. ''Thousands of companies are on life
support that just have to die,'' he said. ''Our industry is in the
inevitable process of maturing.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yet Mr. Ellison's concept of a maturing industry is not exactly a
listless old age. There will be fewer companies and slower growth, he
said, but still plenty of leeway for entrepreneurial creativity. ''There
will continue to be very cool new computing technologies,'' Mr. Ellison
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unlike so many industrial technologies -- railroads, say, or the
telegraph -- the stored-program computer is a general-purpose tool,
animated by software, a medium without material constraints. The
unrelenting pace of improvement in processing speeds, data storage and
miniaturization means the tools are more powerful and smaller; people
then figure out things to do with them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, innovation continues apace, despite the downturn. Advances
are evident in a range of technologies -- wireless, data center
automation, speech recognition, intelligent software, telephone service
over the Internet, sensors, natural language processing, and on and on.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Underestimating the potential for computing has proved a common
pitfall over the years, from Thomas J. Watson at I.B.M. in 1943 (''I
think there is a world market for maybe five computers'') Ken Olsen at
Digital Equipment in 1977 (''There is no reason anyone would want a
computer in their home'').
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jim Gray, a computer scientist, has worked in the industry for more
than 30 years. For his pioneering research on databases and transaction
processing at I.B.M. and elsewhere, he won the 1999 A. M. Turing Award,
sometimes called the Nobel of computer science. ''I've seen the 'end' at
least twice in my career -- only to be surprised by the next wave,''
said Mr. Gray, who now works for Microsoft. ''My guess is that this
computer thing has just gotten started.''

IN corporate America, health insurance is so important in recruiting
and retaining employees that nearly every big company provides it. But
among small businesses, about 40 percent of owners say they simply
cannot afford the coverage. And many that provide it have been cutting
back and shifting costs to their workers. A result is that more than
half of the 41.2 million uninsured Americans are employees of small
businesses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The main issue is price: costs have been rising an average of 10 to
40 percent for several years. Small businesses have experienced the most
significant annual increases; by contrast, big companies have had
increases of about 10 percent.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For many small businesses, the bill for health insurance often runs
two or three times more than all other insurance costs combined. Summit
Tile and Marble, a company in Woodinville, Wash., that sells and
installs tile and marble, is paying $34,000 this year for health
insurance for its 10 employees, compared with $10,000 for liability
coverage for its equipment, cars and trucks. Total Media, a video and
audiotape distributor in South Hackensack, N.J., is paying nearly
$58,000 for health insurance for its 15 employees this year compared
with $27,000 for all other insurance combined.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The rising costs are on everybody's minds,'' said John Nelson, a
vice president at Warner Pacific Insurance Services in Westlake Village,
Calif.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small businesses have been hit with the greatest increases, partly
because they create higher administrative costs for insurers and because
claims costs can be spread more effectively over large groups.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Joseph Trapani, the president of Dascit/White &amp; Winston, a wholesale
broker of health insurance in New York, said small businesses were
moderating the increases by turning to policies with features like
higher deductible amounts and co-payments up to $50 for visits to
doctors. Aetna and several other big insurers have begun offering
slimmed-down packages to small businesses that promise considerable
savings while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some businesses have found they can save considerably by shopping
around. Michael Sollitto, the owner of the V &amp; L Machine and Tool
Company, a small machine shop in Clifton, N.J., said he cut his costs by
several thousand dollars a year by shifting from Horizon Blue Cross Blue
Shield of New Jersey to Guardian, the lowest of three bidders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One solution has been to drop coverage. But rather than do that, Mr.
Nelson of Warner Pacific said that many of his customers in California
had been moving to less expensive plans. They have often overlooked the
cheapest plan, he said, for something in the middle range. ''They don't
want to adjust their benefits too drastically,'' he said, ''for fear of
losing their employees.''

''Bad times make you more focused,'' said Judith Gerberg, a career

A ready supply of talent, an abundance of office space and less
competition for financing are other reasons to consider starting a
business when the economy is lagging, experts say. But regardless of the
economic climate, there are rules that apply to anyone embarking on an
entrepreneurial venture, at any time.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of every 100 Americans 18 years or over, 6.2 are engaged in starting
a business, according to a study funded by the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation in Kansas City, Mo., which provides education and information
about small businesses. Unfortunately, new business failures are common.
''Most new businesses fail, and they do so within the first three
years,'' said Rebecca Macieira-Kaufmann, an executive vice president who
specializes in small business at Wells Fargo, the banking company.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Educate Yourself
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Plug the words ''starting your own business'' into any search engine
and you will be overwhelmed by the number of responses. Among them is My
Own Business (www.myownbusiness.org[http://www.myownbusiness.org/]), a Web site operated by a nonprofit
group that offers a free online course on starting a business. There is
also FastTrac (www.fasttrac.org[http://www.fasttrac.org/]), which offers classes in small business
around the country. Rob Chernow, the senior vice president for
entrepreneurship at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which sponsors
FastTrac, said: ''The courses help people figure out if being an
entrepreneur is for them. They are able to flesh out if they are likely
to have a viable business.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consider Moonlighting
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Who says we are obliged to quit our jobs when we start a
business?'' said Philip Holland, the author of ''How to Start a Business
Without Quitting Your Job.'' ''I once did but only because at the time I
didn't know any better.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Assuming you do not have an enormous need for sleep, keeping your day
job gives you income and something to fall back on if the new venture
fails. If you are thinking of starting a business in a field that you
are unfamiliar with, consider getting a second job in that field before
taking the plunge. After you have been on your feet all day as a
chambermaid-cum-waitress at a charming little bed-and-breakfast, you may
not fantasize so much about opening one. You will also have a better
idea of what is required.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Harness Your Passion
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Passion underlies the sweat equity that you need to start your own
business. Amy Millman, the president of Springboard Enterprises, a
Washington company that helps women entrepreneurs find investors, said,
''Entrepreneurs underestimate the importance of passion to get them
through the hard times.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Then there is the cash commitment that lenders or investors usually
want to see before they agree to back your business. Even the Small
Business Administration, a federal agency that guarantees bank loans to
small businesses, expects you to have equity in your business totaling
25 to 50 percent of the loan you are requesting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Carolyn A. Minerich of Jacksonville, Ala., invested both sweat equity
and cash in her business. She took the $250,000 in savings she and her
husband had accumulated and in 1996 started Carmin Industries, a
metal-fabricating company that uses a water-jet technology that can cut
through as much as six inches of stone and metal without burning the
edges. It took years for the company to get off the ground, but today
Ms. Minerich has a business earning annual revenues of $1 million, a
30,000-square-foot factory, 20 employees and clients including Walt
Disney World in Florida, which ordered a 50-foot Mickey Mouse hand.

Raj Khera of Rockville, Md., started GovCon.com in 1995 with his

Develop a Thick Skin

Get used to rejection because you will experience a lot of it. ''I'm
constitutionally unable to hear the word no,'' said Lorraine C. Scarpa,
a co-founder of ImmediateFX, a software firm in Monroe, Conn.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stay Focused
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Focus is the process of defining your business -- what your niche is,
who your customers are and how you will serve them. ''You need to find
out what you can make money at, what customers would buy from you,'' Mr.
Khera said. ''You'll always have competitors, so is there something you
can make that fits into a specific niche?'' Also, when you are looking
for financing, investors and lenders will want to know what makes you
different from the others out there and how well you understand your
market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Before starting ImmediateFX with James Friedman and another partner,
Ms. Scarpa and Mr. Friedman used to meet for lunch to talk about
problems in the marketing industry -- she from the perspective of a
buyer of marketing data, he as the head of a company that provided it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We had that 'Aha!' moment in a restaurant,'' Mr. Friedman recalled.
''We realized we had a business.'' In 1999, they started their company,
selling software to integrate marketing data, and now have a business
with annual revenues of $5 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Keep It Simple
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is one thing to be flexible when you are starting a business; and
another to lose your focus by taking on any -- and all -- business to
bring in money. This was a temptation faced by Michael Kimelman and
Sheila Baird when they started their investment advisory firm, Kimelman
&amp; Baird, in Manhattan in 1966. They began by focusing on undervalued
securities and, despite pressure over the years to take a different
approach, have remained that way. Now, they manage $300 million in
assets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Besides sticking to their core business, Ms. Baird said, they kept a
strict eye on costs. She advised anybody starting a company to ''spend
your money on systems and personnel that you need to run the business,
but don't let yourself get saddled with heavy costs because then you are
tempted to do things away from your focus just to cover your costs.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although they paid themselves salaries, the partners did not give
themselves raises for the first 15 years. If there were profits at the
end of the year, the partners shared them, ''but we never increased our
salaries,'' Mr. Kimelman said. ''That would have meant more overhead.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Putting Success on Paper
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''People tend just to dive in without thinking where they hope to get
with their business,'' said Emily Swenson, a partner at Gansevoort
Media, a financial consulting firm in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Swenson said that entrepreneurs must always be able to answer
questions like, How much money do you want to be making in three years?
How many employees will you have? How will you be making your product?
Where will you be selling it?

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Having the answers in your head is not enough; you must also write
them down in the form of a business plan. ''All business owners should
have a business plan,'' said Ms. Macieira-Kaufmann of Wells Fargo. ''It
is very hard to have a dialogue about financing without one.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The thought of writing a business plan strikes fear in the hearts of
many would-be entrepreneurs. It should not, though, because there is so
much help available. For example, the book ''Business Plans That Work,''
by Joan Gillman, consists of strategies that entrepreneurs have used
successfully to raise money. Another useful and comprehensive guide can
be found on the Small Business Administration's Web site (www.sba.gov[http://www.sba.gov/]).
There is an outline that you can customize for your business, with
thorough explanations of what should be included in each section.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''My advice is, don't make it too lengthy -- keep it simple,'' said
Bonita Walsh, the senior managing director for the commercial markets
group at Citibank. ''You want to describe the business, how you are
going to get customers, what the competition is and how the money will
come in and go out.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cash Is King
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When small businesses fail, it is usually because of cash-flow
problems. ''There are very few businesses where the cash comes in
equally throughout the year,'' Ms. Gillman said. As most entrepreneurs
discover, customers do not always pay their bills on time. But business
owners, unfortunately, have expenses like salaries and rent that have to
be paid on a regular basis.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Managing cash flow is all about collecting from customers in a timely
way without alienating them, and creating a timetable for paying
suppliers without irritating them. Profit and cash are not the same
thing, and a business that can show accounting profits can still fold.

WHEN the world's biggest companies do business with the millions of
minnows on the commercial landscape, the outcome can be tough for the
little guys.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small companies routinely sustain losses struggling to get -- and
keep -- the attention of giants that they hope to supply with products
or services. But those who operate small businesses say that buying from
a behemoth can also lead to pain.

''For them, it's one of a million things,'' said Barry Weinbaum,
president and chief executive of NanoOpto, a start-up vendor of optical
components for communications gear, based in Somerset, N.J. ''For us,
it's life or death.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Such thinking led Mr. Weinbaum, a former Lucent Technologies
executive who knows big companies from the inside, to choose the
Innovative Computing and Networking Corporation, a reseller of
information systems, over dealing directly with I.B.M. when NanoOpto set
up its computer system. ''I like to know I am talking to the president
if there is any problem,'' Mr. Weinbaum said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, for I.B.M. and numerous other corporate giants, selling to
small businesses is a growth area, and they are trying harder than ever
to court them. American Express has been steadily adding new features to
its credit card for small business. ''We created the special plastic for
small business category in 1996,'' said Kerry Hatch, an executive vice
president at American Express, ''and it's been heating up ever since.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When it comes to finance, American Express most likely has the
broadest relationship with small businesses. In addition to its
credit-card business, which some small companies use to cover hundreds
of thousands of dollars a month in cash needs, American Express has been
expanding its leasing operations for equipment that costs $250,000 or
less. Last year, it created a small-business network called OPEN
(www.openamericanexpress.com[http://www.openamericanexpress.com/]) to bring together various services, Web
tools and discount programs with other giants like Exxon Mobil, Dell
Computer, FedEx and Staples, allowing customers to save money on common
expenses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
OPEN also aims to encourage small businesses to do much of their
record keeping on its Web site. This month, it will start updating
quarterly statements weekly online and make it easier for customers to
categorize expenses differently. ''Limousine drivers might want to track
gasoline expenses differently than a construction firm,'' said Ms.
Hatch, who is also the general manager of OPEN. ''We want to make the
Internet the best way of doing business with us going forward.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many of these large companies with products to sell to small
businesses rely primarily on resellers, like Innovative Computing (which
handles I.B.M. products and many others), and on the Internet. But many
have not given up on more direct contacts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
I.B.M. tracks venture capital announcements and calls on new
companies that have just raised cash. Unlike most small businesses,
start-ups are often in the market for more than a single product. And
when I.B.M. comes across a venture like Pristine.com, a company in White
Plains, N.Y., that trains stock traders, it may offer more than its
usual line of products, services and flexible financing, said Laura
Avolio, an I.B.M. account representative. I.B.M. has sponsored some of
Pristine.com's seminars and offered free use of I.B.M. meeting rooms in
return for the chance to show its trading equipment to Pristine's
students.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
I.B.M. is also trying to individualize its treatment of small
businesses at IBM.com, its Web site, at least when it comes to selling.
Its small and medium-size business portal (www-1.ibm.com
/businesscenter/us) has call-me or text-chat buttons that are connected
to products.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company has begun trolling for more small-business customers
through an auction program on eBay, selling equipment that I.B.M. has
refurbished or recently phased out. About 80 percent of the equipment is
sold to small businesses that are new to I.B.M. and half have agreed to
receive calls from the company with other offers, according to Alex G.
Gogh, director of IBM.com marketing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At Microsoft, a business-software group has developed a more
imaginative approach to serving the small-business market by focusing on
Southridge, an executive search firm in Buffalo. Product engineers and
marketing experts in the Microsoft contingent want to know how they can
convince Maggie Simmons, Southridge's owner, that Microsoft products and
services will increase her profits. They also try to help Sean O'Bryan,
her office manager and accountant, keep the server, which supports the
office's desktop computers, and printers humming, and to make it easy
for Sally Taylor, a clerical worker, to use Microsoft software for tasks
like managing customer lists.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most of all, Microsoft aims to impress Stuart Walker, Southridge's
technology consultant and troubleshooter. To sell to Southridge,
Microsoft needs consultants like Mr. Walker to be up to date on every
new wrinkle it introduces into its small-business-product lineup.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The one thing that Microsoft, the world's largest software company,
does not expect from Southridge is feedback. The search firm and its
employees are pure fiction, a small business and its key figures
conjured up by researchers to help Microsoft maintain a detailed image
of real small-business customers as it tries to increase its sales to
them. To enhance the fiction, Microsoft has printed and distributed
trading cards for its employees picturing Maggie and the others and, on
the back, describing their jobs and characteristics.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We often ask, 'What would Stuart do?' '' said Katy Hunter, group
product manager for Windows Server, the Microsoft operating system for
computers that acts as a hub for small networks of desktop computers and
other devices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE cards are one element in a broad Microsoft drive to increase
sales to small and midsize businesses, to $10 billion by the end of the
decade from $300 million this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One tendency these and other giants have to fight, marketing experts
said, is the practice of grouping small-  and midsize businesses
together. Definitions vary widely, with estimates of the number of small
businesses in the United States ranging from 10 million to 20 million,
accounting for $150 billion or more in annual purchases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Small businesses don't like to be lumped into one giant pool based
on size, regardless of segment, age and needs,'' said Ken Lubar, a
managing director at EMI Strategic Marketing in Boston. ''There's a big
gap between $1 million in revenue and $50 million.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The larger small businesses are more likely to have multiple
locations and specialized executives, like a controller, a full-time
marketing manager or someone overseeing manufacturing. ''The wife isn't
doing the bookkeeping and there is more reliance on professionals to
make decisions,'' Mr. Lubar said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If there is one thing smaller businesses have in common, Mr. Lubar
said, it is the little long-term planning they do, an aspect that large
organizations have trouble with, especially when these customers might
be ready to buy services. ''They are I-need-it-now decision makers,'' he
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the AT&amp;T Corporation, which serves about 3.9 million businesses
with fewer than 100 employees, said that a common denominator seemed to
be a desire for simplicity, like a single bill for all communications
services or one number to call for service problems. AT&amp;T has also found
that simplicity is important when it is selling small companies the
technology products that midsize businesses buy. It bundles such data
management, networking and other abilities into convenient packages,
said Mark Metzendorf, vice president in charge of AT&amp;T's small and
midsize business unit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Big businesses think that sophisticated but straightforward Internet
tools are an important selling point for many small businesses. America
Online, a unit of AOL Time Warner, introduced AOL for Small Business
last fall after surveys showed that many small-business subscribers to
AOL were concerned that they did not take full advantage of the
Internet. The site offers, among other things, tips on subjects like
finance, how to get free publicity and how to use AOL to network with
other businesses or potential customers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Others are finding that though the Internet is efficient, it still
cannot match the benefit of direct contact. About 40 percent of the
orders last year on the main Web site of Grainger, the nation's largest
distributor of machinery components, industrial hardware and maintenance
supplies, came from businesses employing 10 or fewer people. But many of
Grainger's most enthusiastic small-business customers, like Tomas
Estrada, who owns Family Fences, a new fence-building company in
Evanston, Ill., still use the Web only to identify what they need and to
compare prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Then I go to their store in Morton Grove,'' Mr. Estrada said.
''They are flexible on price and everybody there is very friendly,
probably because I've been spending a lot of money.''

WASHINGTON -- ANYONE who doubts that small business has big political
clout need only recall the truncated two-year career of Senator Jean
Carnahan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A centrist Democrat from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan was appointed to the
Senate in 2000 after her husband, Mel, the governor of the state, was
killed during his senate race but won the election posthumously. Within
months, Mrs. Carnahan was bombarded by demands from small-business
owners to join Republicans on a vote to permanently repeal the estate
tax.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The letters came by the hundreds -- passionate, personalized and
sometimes even handwritten on company invoices. ''I'm going to be 74
soon and my two sons will get what I have when I die,'' wrote the owner
of a printing company. ''They should not have to pay taxes of 55 percent
on the small business they own.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When Mrs. Carnahan voted against the measure, she became a target for
the National Federation of Independent Business, a nationwide lobbying
group of 600,000 small businesses and a machine to mobilize them. ''She
is sucking the lifeblood out of your business,'' the federation charged
in a flier picturing a hypodermic needle stuffed with money. Placards
extolled her Republican challenger for the Senate in 2002,
Representative James M. Talent, as a ''proven friend'' of small
business.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Political organizers for the lobbying group in Washington attracted
hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions for Mr.
Talent, while members in Missouri organized events to promote him and
attack Mrs. Carnahan, who had begun the campaign well ahead in the polls
but saw her lead evaporate to go down in defeat by 22,000 votes.
National Republican groups were also mobilizing to defeat Mrs. Carnahan.
But political analysts say the small-business federation played a
crucial role, as it did in more than 30 other Congressional races in
which it was active.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Small business has gone from being a player to being the dominant
player in the business community,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of
the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors and a longtime
lobbyist in Washington.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The big-business guys are more pragmatic, giving a 60-40 split in
money to the two parties,'' he said. ''The small-business guys are much
more ideological.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As a bitterly divided Congress moves into the decisive phase of
battles over President Bush's $726 billion tax-cutting plan, the
small-business political machinery is again playing a major role. When
the president began a campaign last month on behalf of his plan, he
invited more than 250 small-business owners and lobbyists to show their
support in a Rose Garden ceremony. When Congress convened for spring
break, small-business advocates were waiting in states like Maine and
Ohio to influence lawmakers through advertising, meetings and organized
events. And the federation is not alone in its activism. Many big
lobbying groups that represent small companies pledged their support for
Mr. Bush's plan before they knew what was in it. They did so partly on
the conviction that any package of tax cuts would be good, but also on
the expectation that support for the president's top priorities would
mean far more support for their own agenda.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many admit they were surprised that the biggest element of the plan
was the president's proposal to eliminate taxes on stock dividends, a
proposal that has no direct impact on most small companies, which are
overwhelmingly privately held and do not pay dividends.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I've been in tax lobbying for 20 years now, and I never spent more
than five minutes thinking about dividend taxes,'' said Mr. Van Dongen.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In justifying their no-questions-asked support for the Bush plan,
including the dividend tax cut, small-business lobbyists say that other
features will provide a huge benefit to their clients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush's proposal to accelerate the reduction of individual tax
rates, they say, will affect hundreds of thousands of small companies
that report their profits through the individual tax returns of their
owners. That population includes sole proprietorships, from family
grocery stores to local dry cleaners, as well as hundreds of thousands
of so-called S corporations. ''About 85 percent of our members pay the
bulk of their taxes on their individual returns,'' said Daniel Danner,
senior vice president responsible for federal programs at the National
Federation of Independent Business. ''Their personal return and their
business return is one and the same.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The other major enticement for small businesses is a seemingly
mundane proposal to triple the amount of money spent on new equipment
that a small business can write off as an immediate expense against
profits. The proposal, which is of huge interest to mom-and-pop
companies that are buying, say, computers or cars or dry-cleaning
equipment, would raise the amount to $75,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Beyond the immediate issue, however, groups like the National
Federation of Independent Business have cultivated their reputations as
movers and shakers with easy access to the top echelons of the White
House and Congress. One such player is Jack Faris, president and chief
executive of the National Federation of Independent Business. ''You can
rest assured that Andy Card will return his phone calls,'' said one
veteran lobbyist, referring to Andrew H. Card Jr., President Bush's
chief of staff.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Democrats, of course, try to woo the small-business vote. John Kerry,
the Democratic senator from Massachusetts who is running for president,
unveiled a plan last month for tax cuts specifically aimed at small
companies. But the Democrats face an uphill fight. There is no question
that Republican leaders are more closely aligned with the agenda being
pushed by small-business lobbies, and that they listen closely to
small-business complaints.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For instance, small-business groups were enraged by regulations
imposed in the waning days of the Clinton administration that protected
workers against physical problems like repetitive-stress injury from
computer keyboards. They amassed a huge coalition that ranged from
restaurateurs to courier services, all arguing that the so-called
ergonomic requirements would impose major costs and risks to small
companies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Largely by invoking the mantra ''small business,'' a phrase with
vague but deeply sympathetic resonance among voters, the Bush
administration and Congressional Republicans brushed off intense
opposition by labor unions and rescinded most of the regulations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''What small businesses want most of all is to be left alone,'' said
Frank C. Fillmore Jr., founder of the Fillmore Group, a technology
consulting firm in Ellicott City, Md., that has five employees.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That mantra dovetails with the Bush administration's agenda. But the
two agendas are not the same, and some veteran lobbyists worry that
small-business groups run the risk of being shortchanged.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The most immediate concern is about the tax plan. When the Senate
adopted a budget resolution last month that limited the tax cut to $350
billion over 10 years, compared with $550 billion embraced by the House,
it greatly increased the probability that part of Mr. Bush's plan would
be scrapped.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The question is, which part? President Bush and his top economic team
are passionately in favor of the dividend tax cut, which would cost more
than $350 billion over 10 years. Small-business groups, on the other
hand, are adamant about the expensing provisions and the individual rate
reductions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John S. Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council,
an organization of small trade associations, said the support of small
business groups for the entire plan and their appearance in the Rose
Garden could undermine their own priorities. ''Where our influence is
greatest is in the perception that this is what small business wants,''
Mr. Satagaj said. ''When they are in the Rose Garden and the dividend
issue is front and center, the message gets out that this is what small
business wants.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small-business lobbyists have been jolted before. After campaigning
for Mr. Bush's tax-cutting package in 2001, the groups were stunned when
their beloved expensing provision was dropped during Congressional
negotiations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Van Dongen, who organized the Tax Relief Coalition, a lobbying
group of 1,000 companies and others, before Mr. Bush even announced his
newest plan, said the risk was worth taking. ''There are no guarantees
in this game,'' he said. ''But if that fact causes you to pull your
punches because you're afraid of losing, you have in effect negotiated
yourself out of the game.''

squeezed in. ''We little guys have a hard time devoting the resources we
need to do it,'' Mr. Lethers said.

Still, he said, having a Web site is worth the trouble. Sales of his

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Kelsey Group, a research company in Boston, recently found that
the number of small businesses (defined as 100 employees or less) with a
Web site has increased, but not as fast as had been predicted. In a 2002
survey of businesses that advertise, 43 percent had a Web site, up from
36 percent in 1999.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consider your local hair salon, said Neal Polachek, a senior vice
president and small-business specialist at the Kelsey Group. Maybe they
are getting all the customers they need through old-fashioned word of
mouth. For businesses like that, he said, ''having a Web site is not
necessarily the be-all to end-all.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By contrast, many small businesses that seek customers nationally
have found that a Web site can be a useful sales channel or marketing
tool. A modest but healthy subset of small businesses has even prospered
on the Web alone.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small businesses that want to build a Web site will find that doing
so is easier than in the pioneering mid-90's. New software and services
have sprung up that bypass many of the hassles in setting up a site or a
Web store. The intent is to allow business owners to drain the swamp
instead of fight the alligators.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Here are examples of how new tools and services are helping many
types of businesses:
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Web Site Templates
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Setting up a Web site used to be an exercise in frustration,'' said
Mie-Yun Lee, the founder of BuyerZone .com, a site that matches small
businesses with technology companies that sell the equipment they need.
People had to learn HTML code, or Hypertext Markup Language;
abbreviations like F.T.P. (file transfer protocol); and strange uses of
familiar words like ''socket'' (a method of communicating with network
programs). ''They would say, F.T.P.? What is F.T.P.?'' Ms. Lee said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today's e-commerce services have enabled entrepreneurs to set up Web
sites by picking a template, selecting colors and themes and inserting
texts of their choice. No coding is required, and, depending on the
Web-building service, no knowledge of F.T.P. is necessary. Additions or
substitutions to a page are simply done with the click of a button on a
Web site.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adam Noble is a college student in Florida who started a Web business
in 2000 as a broker selling parts for customizing cars, like specialty
muffler tips. He had heard about FreeMerchant.com from a neighbor and
used the service to set up his own site, calledAIEOnline.com, with a
template. He pays $25 a month for the software, which is sold by Digital
River, an e-commerce company. ''It took no more than a week,'' said Mr.
Noble, who runs the business from his bedroom.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If you do not want to be hemmed in by a template and still want to
avoid HTML, there is FrontPage, a program included in Microsoft Office
software that many small-business owners already have. DreamWeaver, $399
software from Macromedia, offers more flexibility and creativity and is
used by professional Web site developers. In both cases, you do not need
to know any code.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Online Shopping Carts
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lynne Bingham started her business on the Web in 1994 as www
.thestorkdelivers.com, creating custom baskets of baby gifts. ''We were
the e-commerce guinea pig of Pittsburgh,'' she said. She is embarrassed
to recall what her site looked like. ''Oh, God, it was a joke,'' she
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In January 2001, she decided to revamp the site. She wanted to use
what is called shopping cart software, which enables people to buy items
online using a credit card. But she did not want to learn new computer
code or pay the exorbitant prices that she first discovered for software
of that type. (One vendor, she said, offered her software for $35,000.)
She decided to try Yahoo Stores, a service that combines Web services
like shopping cart software with marketing through Yahoo's shopping
channel. It costs $50 a month, with fees for transactions, commissions
and listings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now Ms. Bingham is listed as a top seller on Yahoo and has expanded
to five employees.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yahoo is not the only source for shopping cart software. (Several
merchants, by the way, have grumbled that Yahoo Shopping's latest
pricing is too expensive because it takes commissions from purchases.)
Ralph F. Wilson, the author of several books on e-commerce, including an
e-book on wilsonweb.com, which includes reviews of shopping cart
products, describes several other shopping cart forms. Some of these
include Storefront.com, ShopSite .com, freemerchant.com and
1ShoppingCart.com. While others are offered by BizLand, Homestead and
Microsoft's bCentral. Prices range from $12 a month (plus fees) to a
one-time charge of $1,300 to use the software.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Niche-Oriented Directories
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Patrick Sutton, a kitchen designer in Alexandria, Va., started his
Web site, suttondesign.com, in 1997. It became a showcase for his
portfolio, but he was not sure how potential clients would find it.
''Back in '97, I put it up on a wing and a prayer without thinking of
how I was connected to other sites,'' Mr. Sutton said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now he is fully aware of how people find him. He can see, for
example, that much of the traffic to his site comes from online
directories that list architects and designers, like HGTV.com and
ThisOldHouse.com. ''Directory sites are very important to me and I keep
them updated,'' Mr. Sutton said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Sutton is not assuming, however, that people know how to find
these directories. Luckily, search engines like Google have become
better at pointing people to those directories.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But search technology is not the only thing that has helped. A new
form of online advertising, sometimes called keyword advertising or
sponsored links, is gaining currency. There are various forms -- the
search engine Overture is best known for the technique -- but
essentially keyword advertising enables a company to connect quickly
with people searching for precisely what the company offers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pages from the business's Web site are highlighted by the search
engine after a search is performed, and advertisements on the right-hand
side of pages lead shoppers directly to the ''store.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The business can target customers who need niche products like dog
booties without the wasteful expense of mass mailings,'' wrote Joanne H.
Pratt in a 2002 report from the Small Business Administration.
''Instead, customers find them simply by typing in the words ''dog
booties.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephanie Loftus of LoftusDesigns .com, a custom-furniture store,
started using Overture in October and Google Adwords -- another form of
keyword advertising -- three months ago. The response was so great that
she and her husband, John, decided to close their showroom in Jenks,
Okla., and do all their transactions on the Web. ''Now we ship coast to
coast,'' Ms. Loftus said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Automating EBay
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
EBay is known not only as a space for collectors, but also as a place
for small businesses to make a name for themselves on the Web without
building their own sites. By managing hundreds of auctions a week, a
seller can turn eBay into a full-time job.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the last few years, eBay has taken note of the small businesses
that are selling on its site and developed tools to make it easier for
them to conduct many transactions (and, of course, to allow eBay to
collect large amounts of transaction fees).
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adam Noble, the college student who founded AIEOnline.com, started on
eBay. At first, the more items he auctioned, the more the work turned
tedious. Now he uses Turbo Lister, a free eBay tool available to
sellers. ''You can get 20 auctions on eBay in a matter of minutes,
instead of spending hours entering each one by one,'' Mr. Noble said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many other software products are also available to eBay sellers to
automate their work, said Marsha Collier, author of ''Starting an eBay
Business for Dummies.'' Companies like AuctionWorks.com and Andale.com
help heavy sellers keep up with the auctions that close, the items that
need to be shipped, the photographs that must be uploaded and the
customers with questions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''When you are listing 100 times a day and people are paying you at
that quick a rate, it really helps to have a service that sends you this
information, so that you aren't fumbling around in e-mail trying to keep
track,'' she said.

CONCORD, Mass. -- EARLY one morning last month, 14 small-business
owners gathered around a table and, over coffee and muffins, spoke for
the next two hours of their curiosity and qualms about taking the
technological plunge into Web sites, company e-mail addresses and
perhaps even selling over the Internet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They ran genuinely small businesses, most with a handful of
employees, some sole proprietors among them. They sold bridal clothes,
antiques, jewelry, security systems, flowers, herbal-care products,
greeting cards and gourmet foods. Most of them said they used
e-mail-messages regularly, but none had company e-mail addresses or Web
sites.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This focus-group session was one of dozens sponsored in the last few
months by Interland, a company that is hoping to cash in on the
potentially vast but tricky market for helping small businesses get
online. Behind the one-way mirror at this session and others sat Dan
Bricklin, Interland's chief technology officer. His job is to study how
small businesses do, and do not, use technology -- the needs, wishes and
fears of their owners. Then, he must try to design simple, affordable
software tools to give them what they want.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sitting behind the mirror and observing the group inside, Mr.
Bricklin said that the real challenge was to figure out how to reach a
portion of the 20 million businesses in the United States with 10
employees or fewer and ease their entry onto the Internet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This is the mass market for small business,'' he said. ''Cracking
this market is the holy grail.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A daunting challenge, but if anyone is up to the task it is Mr.
Bricklin, who has spent most of his career as an entrepreneurial
small-businessman, as well as a skilled technologist.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bricklin has already played an important role in helping
democratize technology as a pioneering innovator in the personal
computer industry and says that he thinks the Internet is the next step
in delivering powerful technology to individuals and small businesses.
''The beauty of the PC was that it leveled the playing field and let
small businesses do so much more,'' Mr. Bricklin said. ''This technology
is that same kind of tool.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He and his friend and collaborator, Bob Frankston, created the
electronic spreadsheet program called VisiCalc, which jump-started the
personal-computer revolution. The big money in spreadsheets would be
made by big companies -- first Lotus Development, which bought Mr.
Bricklin's firm, and later Microsoft. Yet Mr. Bricklin showed the way in
1979 with the spreadsheet program, a practical tool for business that
allowed anyone with a personal computer to do financial modeling and
simulation previously available only to corporations with mainframe
computers and corps of research analysts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By instinct, philosophy and breeding, Mr. Bricklin explained, he is a
small-businessman.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
His father, Baruch, and his grandfather, Simon, managed the family
printing business in Philadelphia. Mr. Bricklin went to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he caught the computing bug
in the days before there were such things as personal computers. He
earned an M.B.A. at the Harvard Business School, where he came up with
the idea for VisiCalc.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since then, he has moved from one idea and venture to another,
including Demo, a simulation software program designed for
nonprogrammers, and Slate, which made software for pen-based computers
before that market emerged with simple products like hand-held
computers. Some of Mr. Bricklin's efforts have been successful and
others not. He has made a good living, if not a killing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He personifies what Eric von Hippel, a professor of business at the
Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., has called the ''lead-user
phenomenon,'' observing that so much of practical innovation comes from
a small number of imaginative people who tinker with the latest
technology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bricklin first demonstrated that trait as a child, building a
shortwave radio, a stereo that the family played for years and a kitchen
intercom that his mother, Ruth, used to summon him to meals from his
bedroom upstairs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
These days, Mr. Bricklin is tinkering with new gadgetry. He carries a
pocket-size digital camera, the latest cellphone equipped with organizer
software and a tiny keyboard and a new notebook personal computer with a
screen that can be used as a tablet for writing notes with a stylus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But his real interest lies in trying to bridge the gap between geeky
technology and ordinary people.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''My focus has been mainly on the regular user,'' Mr. Bricklin said.
''The challenge is to make it easy to use tools.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The corporate life and the blandishments of big business never
appealed to him much. ''I didn't want to be a cog in a big machine,''
said Mr. Bricklin, a bearded 51-year-old who was wearing blue jeans, a
flannel shirt and running shoes. ''You have more responsibility in a
small business, but you also have more freedom. I love the freedom, and
I love the hands-on nature of it -- you meet the customers and you build
the product.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
TODAY Mr. Bricklin works for a larger enterprise because his latest
company, Trellix, based here, was acquired last December by Interland,
which has annual revenue of $120 million. As part of a bigger company
with deeper pockets, he has a better chance to take his
Web-site-building software to a wider market. ''Right now, I am in a
bigger business, but I am representing small business,'' he said. ''I
reek of small business.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Interland, which is based in Atlanta, is betting that the use of the
Internet by small businesses will follow the same pattern as the
personal computer industry did years ago. Until the early 90's, said
Joel J. Kocher, a former senior executive at Dell Computer who is now
the chief executive of Interland, PC's were still difficult for many
people to use, so they shunned them. But the adoption of Microsoft's
Windows operating system, with its point-and-click icons, and other
improvements, opened the door to a much larger market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A similar phenomenon, Interland hopes, is about to unfold in the
market for operating Web sites. In this market, a Web site ''hosting''
supplier, like Interland, runs the big data centers where millions of
Web pages reside. But a full-featured Web site for browsing and shopping
can still cost thousands of dollars a year and require technical
expertise that small businesses lack.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Interland intends to lower that barrier by offering Web site hosting
to small businesses for as little as $23 a month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company's basic service, introduced in April, includes a Web
site, a dot-com domain name and 30 e-mail-message accounts. It offers
templates for about 200 designs, the ability to add and edit pictures
and publish and update text without having to program in HTML, or
Hypertext Markup Language, the technical lingua franca of Web sites. To
handle online purchases or include Web logs, or blogs, costs extra.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many companies are chasing what is expected to be a sizable market
for managing Web sites and e-commerce for small businesses. Industry
analysts predict that the market will double or triple over the next
three or four years, with estimates ranging up to $9 billion a year.
These projections are best taken with a handful of salt, but the market
does seem promising.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Besides Interland, the suppliers of Web hosting services include
Affinity, NTT Verio, Homestead, Yahoo, regional Bell telephone companies
and others. Many companies, like Microsoft and Macromedia, offer
specialized software tools for building Web sites.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Interland bought Trellix, Mr. Kocher said, because it built the most
comprehensive, easy-to-use tools for helping small businesses develop an
online presence, an expertise that Mr. Bricklin and his team had worked
on as they sold their software to companies that offered hosting
services to small businesses and individuals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''For us, the secret sauce is Dan Bricklin and his team's deep
knowledge of small business,'' Mr. Kocher said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the focus group, a woman who manages a bridal shop said she was
concerned because customers asked if she has a Web site, and she has to
tell them no.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''You hear that all the time in these sessions -- the customers are
asking,'' Mr. Bricklin said behind the mirror. ''Having a Web site has
become a generational necessity for a lot of businesses. You lose the
people under 30 without it.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Several of the small-business owners also expressed worries about the
time, costs and technical hassles of going online. ''Small businesses
are often very skeptical of new things,'' Mr. Bricklin said. ''That's
logical because they have to make decisions quickly. They don't have the
time to do research, or the staff to do it for them.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So small businesses tend to adopt what Amar Bhide, a professor of
business at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, called
a ''heads I win, tails I don't lose much'' attitude toward risk.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That approach, Mr. Bricklin said, was precisely why most small
businesses should think of moving online.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Don't try to be Amazon.com with a full e-commerce presence all at
once. Step in gradually, he said, by starting with a Web site and
company e-mail. ''You have to try it out -- see what works for you and
what doesn't work for you,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Internet, Mr. Bricklin said, is best viewed as an important but
supplemental tool for business. ''It is a medium of business that you
have to understand, just like doing business over the telephone or
face-to-face selling are mediums of business,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As a medium, the Internet enables even a small business to present a
lot of information about itself and allows customers and suppliers to
interact through a Web site or e-mail. Even if the information is as
simple as store hours, it helps.''The person who wants to drop by your
store on the way to work wants to know if you're going to be open at 8
a.m., and he wants to know that at 10:30 p.m. the night before,'' Mr.
Bricklin said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For most small businesses, he added, a reasonable goal for an online
presence is to increase sales by 10 percent without having to add more
employees.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''That is huge -- it means a better vacation,'' he said. ''Remember,
for these companies the bottom line is their pocketbook.''

THERE is little official evidence to go by, but the anecdotes are
pouring in: across the country, more young black professionals are
stepping off the corporate ladder to become entrepreneurs. Joining a big
company used to be perceived as the surest route to material success by
many black professionals, but lately, owning a business has become as
attractive, or more so.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Four years ago, Billye R. Hill was on the old track. With an M.B.A.
from the Georgia Institute of Technology in hand, she joined the
interactive marketing team at Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati. She loved
her job, and thought she would stay for at least five years. But, she
said, ''I knew going in the door I wasn't meant to work for someone.''
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Soon, Ms. Hill founded a Web site design company as a sideline. As
the economy began contracting, Procter &amp; Gamble started offering buyouts
to employees as part of a downsizing plan. Ms. Hill, who is now 27, saw
an opportunity: she took a payment of about $25,000 -- enough to keep
her afloat for several months -- and turned all her attention to her
small business.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Hill's story is on its way to becoming commonplace in Cincinnati,
said De Asa M. Brown, the chief executive of the Greater Cincinnati
Northern Kentucky African American Chamber of Commerce. The area is home
to a large black population and several Fortune 500 companies.
Downsizing during the economic downturn, Ms. Brown said, gave people
like Ms. Hill the impetus to strike out on their own.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''They had an opportunity to get a great buyout, which was the income
they needed to launch their dream,'' she said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the past, the decision Ms. Hill made would have been more
difficult, said Barbara B. Lang, the chief executive of the District of
Columbia Chamber of Commerce. The new entrepreneurs are ''willing to
take risks that 10 years ago, 20 years ago, African-Americans were not
willing to take,'' she said. ''It's an absolute change in attitude, and
not having to feel that the corporate structure is the only way -- or
the safe way.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One factor supporting that change is increasing education. Starting a
business is ''just a natural extension of the career trajectory from
getting a degree -- a law degree, an M.B.A., whatever,'' said Timothy
Bates, a professor of urban and labor studies and economics at Wayne
State University in Detroit, who has studied black entrepreneurship for
more than three decades.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Education has also improved access to capital, long an obstacle for
black entrepreneurs. Traditionally, they obtained financing from family,
friends and local banks on the strength of their reputations, said
Steven S. Rogers, a professor of entrepreneurship at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill. But not anymore.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''What we're starting to see are more and more African-American
entrepreneurs who have M.B.A.'s,'' Professor Rogers said. ''Now, you're
seeing a new generation of African-American entrepreneurs who are
looking to access capital from all the available resources.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Bates at Wayne State recently completed a study, with
William D. Bradford, a professor of finance at the University of
Washington, of venture capital firms that specialize in investing in
minority-owned businesses. ''The minority venture capital industry has
grown over time,'' he said. ''Probably in the 90's it increased about
tenfold.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study, financed by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas
City, Mo., which promotes education and entrepreneurship, started with
venture capital investments made from 1989 to 1995 and tracked them
through 2000. Just more than half the investments yielded a positive
return, and most of the venture capital funds made money. The foundation
will release the study in its entirety later this month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In terms of rates of return, Professor Bates said, the
minority-focused firms may be ''slightly outperforming'' the venture
capital industry as a whole.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The census bureau also compiles statistics on minority-owned
businesses, but it is just now preparing a survey for 2002. The latest
figures, which compare 1997 to 1992, show that the number of black-owned
companies rose by 26 percent in that period while businesses overall
grew by only 7 percent. Looking more deeply at the data, Professor Bates
said, reveals other promising trends.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''When you're looking solely at the top-end firms, you'll see that
the growth rate is more than twice as high as it is for black businesses
generally,'' he said. ''That's been going for a while.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Between 1992 and 1997, the numbers of relatively small
service-oriented businesses like barbershops and beauty parlors barely
increased. ''The growing firms,'' Professor Bates said, ''are the types
of firms that are selling to corporate customers, government customers
-- the types of firms that are competing in the broader marketplace.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And in his own study of companies receiving venture capital, he
added, ''when you look at the profile of the owners, you're looking at
people coming out of elite jobs in corporate America.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Washington, corporate America means big law and public relations
firms, more so than Fortune 500 companies. ''A lot of lawyers either
leave and go into a single-practitioner, or go into industries very
different from their law training,'' said Ms. Lang of the District of
Columbia Chamber of Commerce. ''The law degree is just a credential for
them.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Given the current state of the economy, it is not surprising that
some of the new entrepreneurs left their old jobs involuntarily. But the
dislocation can act as an impetus to strike out on one's own, Professor
Rogers said, especially among people who are looking to guarantee their
families' futures. ''There's a generation of people that are more into
pursuing wealth creation now, rather than just saying, 'I was
dissatisfied because of the glass ceiling.' ''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nevertheless, the weak economy has made the road to small-business
success more difficult for the new cohort of black entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael L. Hines, 29, started a small marketing firm four years ago
while working for Golin/Harris International, a public relations
division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the marketing and
communications giant. ''I ended up making more money in that company
than I did in my full time,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, Mr. Hines employs five people at Onemarketspace.com, a market
research firm in Washington. But his industry sustained some of the
biggest losses outside of investment banking in the economic downturn of
the last few years. ''It's obviously just a slow market,'' he said,
where making money has become extremely difficult.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the economic constraints, Mr. Hines views entrepreneurship
among young black professionals as a robust trend. ''Most young
African-American men I know are entrepreneurs,'' he said. ''Some are
doing significantly well, but we all seem to be doing at least as well
as our counterparts in corporate America, even now, even here.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Lang said she still believed, however, that black entrepreneurs
faced special obstacles: ''While access to capital is better than it
used to be, there are still issues. The playing field has not been
completely leveled. It's better than it was 10 years ago, but it's not
where it needs to be.''

FOR years, the hassle of dealing with taxes has been the No. 1
problem for small businesses. But late last year the rising cost of
insurance edged ahead as the biggest headache, ranked in national
surveys before taxes, the sluggish economy and poor sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prices for insurance on offices, factories, stores, cars and workers'
compensation have jumped sharply in the last several years, and the cost
of health insurance has been rising relentlessly even longer. Now there
is a new coverage to consider: insurance against terrorist attacks.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As a result, small-business owners are combing through their
policies, looking for coverages that can be cut or eliminated to help
lower costs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For years, prices were relatively stable, and reviewing coverages did
not seem worth the trouble. But Dale Huffman, an Allstate agent in
Orange, Calif., near Los Angeles, says that when he talks with
small-business owners now, ''They're always asking, 'How can you save me
money?' ''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It turns out there are several ways insurance costs can either be cut
or -- more likely -- kept from rising drastically.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One frequently mentioned solution is to cut overall property
coverage. But slicing off, say, 20 percent of the coverage on a $300,000
building in suburban New York would save less than $500 in premiums and
leave an owner with a shortfall of $60,000 in case of a disastrous fire.
Cutting coverage for liability lawsuits is not recommended either,
because the added risk far outweighs the benefits. In some packages, for
example, in which $2 million in liability coverage is standard, giving
up $1 million in coverage saves only about $150 in premiums.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Insurance companies generally refuse to underinsure. A far better
tactic, experts say, is to raise the deductible, thus making it possible
to reduce premiums up to 30 percent in exchange for paying the first
$10,000 in losses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Owners of small businesses can also cut costs by removing themselves
from their company's workers' compensation coverage. The coverage is not
mandatory for them, as it is for employees. If they are hurt, owners can
pay themselves. Or they can substitute disability coverage, which is
usually more costly but provides higher payments when an injury or death
occurs. And some owners have been shifting more of the cost of health
insurance to their employees, as well as reducing benefits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a survey of small businesses, the National Federation of
Independent Business, an advocacy group in Washington, found that about
34 percent of respondents increased the share their employees pay for
health insurance; 30 percent increased their deductible amounts on all
kinds of insurance; and 17 percent reduced or dropped some coverage on
all kinds of insurance.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The important thing is to strike the right balance,'' said Dick
McKenna, an Allstate agent in Roslyn Heights, N.Y. ''You're courting
disaster if you take a bigger deductible than you can comfortably
handle. And for big losses you want to be fully covered.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small businesses are not regarded as prime targets for terrorists. In
a survey by the Hartford Financial Services Group, 42 percent of
respondents said they were more concerned about natural disasters like
hurricanes and tornadoes; and 28 percent ranked terrorism as a main
worry. But because the risk is slight, prices for terrorism coverage for
small businesses are low, and many are buying it. In some cases,
terrorism insurance can add as little as $50 to a small business's
insurance bill, said Mike Hughes, a senior vice president in charge of
coverage for small businesses at Safeco, the Seattle-based insurer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another way to lower premiums is through safety programs. In Los
Angeles, Uni World Tensuke, a seafood company that is a unit of True
World Foods of San Francisco, began paying bonuses to the drivers of its
27 trucks and cars for maintaining clean records. At the same time, it
doubled its deductible to $1,000 and stopped filing claims for most
damage under $2,000. Claims have fallen sharply, said MacKay Holmes, a
senior manager at True World, and premiums for the fleet have dropped by
roughly two-thirds, to about $40,000 a year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jerry Ghinelli, the owner of Total Media, a video and audiotape
distributor in South Hackensack, N.J., has not been able to keep his
premiums with the Hartford from rising. They have jumped 50 percent in
three years to about $27,000 a year. But he figured they would be even
higher if he did not pay so much attention to safety.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Ghinelli said he paid his driver a monthly bonus for avoiding
accidents and tickets. In the company's building, he has nonskid mats in
the hallways, deadbolts on the doors, security cameras and an alarm
system that sends a signal to his personal beeper. He regularly gets his
fire extinguishers and lighted exit signs checked. In 13 years he has
filed one claim -- for about $5,000 for two fake checks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I'd rather not have to call my agent and say, 'Alan, I have a
problem,' '' Mr. Ghinelli said. ''If I had a lot of claims, the premiums
would go up more and they may drop you.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A business owner can often get away with underinsuring because
insurance companies do not inspect every property. But the more an owner
shaves off the top of the coverage, the greater the financial danger. In
most states, if the insurance coverage falls below 80 percent of the
value of the property, insurers are allowed to cut back proportionately
on what they pay in claims. If a building is insured for $150,000, but
its real value turns out to be $300,000, the insurer is required to pay
only 50 percent of any claim. After discovering this kind of deception,
Mr. McKenna said, the insurer will be unlikely to renew.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
These days, even insuring for the full value can be a risk. Until a
few years ago, a standard property policy paid for the replacement of a
shop or a factory. If a shop was insured for, say, $300,000, and the
rebuilding cost was $360,000, the insurance company would simply cover
the cost. But as losses rose, insurers cut back.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, if the owner of a photography shop in a brick building in, say,
Manhassett, N.Y., bought $300,000 in coverage from Allstate for a
premium of roughly $6,700, the payback in a total loss would be
$300,000. If the reconstruction cost more, the owner would have to pay
the difference.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But for an extra $100 per $100,000 of coverage, or $300 for the photo
shop, the money available for replacement would rise 25 percent to
$375,000. On these policies, the basic insured amount automatically
rises annually to match inflation in construction costs. The premium
also rises.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some of the steepest price increases have been for coverage of
building contractors. Many insurers have dropped the coverage, saying
they lose money on it. Those who still provide it have raised their
prices. Big contractors, faced with higher insurance costs, have
increased their deductible amounts and begun demanding higher coverages
of subcontractors working for them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John Gregory, the president of Summit Tile and Marble, a company in
Woodinville, Wash., with 10 employees, including Mr. Gregory and two
other owners, said his company was forced to double its liability to $2
million. His insurance bill with Safeco jumped 40 percent to $10,000
this year, he said, even though he cut the company's auto insurance ''to
the bare minimum.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The three owners are considering dropping workers' compensation
coverage for themselves. When they started 14 years ago, they went
without that insurance, but Glenn Cooper, one partner, said they were
hesitant to drop it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''When you start out,'' he said, ''you have only a wife and maybe a
kid. Now when you have a wife and maybe two or three kids, you've got a
lot more responsibility. Hence, you need to take less risk. We're
looking for some kind of alternative, something that would be less
expensive.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Part of the reason insurance is such a concern for small businesses
is that ''you've got to have it,'' said William J. Dennis Jr., a senior
research fellow at the National Federation of Independent Business
Education Foundation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The alternative is to go bare,'' he said. ''If you've got any kind
of borrowed money, you can't do that because of the lenders. And if you
have any kind of assets, you don't want to do that. Because of the
economic situation, small businesses can't raise prices. So they end up
eating the increased costs. All the alternatives are bad.''

How are they doing? For Mr. Duncan, business is better than ever. Mr.
Chua has chopped his work force by a quarter, but is hanging on. Ms.
Shokoff is doing all right, as other companies' troubles produce
bargains for her customers. Ms. Brinkmeyer is going out of business.
With the exception of Mr. Duncan, every company is doing its best to cut
costs and wait for the economy to rebound.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The state of small business, in other words, depends on the business.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Given the sour economy, the health of a business nowadays is ''all
about sector and location,'' said William C. Dunkelberg, the chief
economist of the National Federation of Independent Business, an
advocacy group in Washington.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Dunkelberg, who conducts a monthly survey of small-business
owners, said that lately there was a lot of pessimism among the
companies polled. But he does not ascribe that to the companies' sizes,
he said; in difficult times, smaller enterprises ''suffer through the
same kinds of problems as big businesses that are in the same field.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the other hand, most small businesses are also service companies.
These days, such companies are generally having an easier time than
those in manufacturing, the sector that has been hardest hit in the
downturn, Mr. Dunkelberg said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even in the service sector, however, the health of a business is
shaped by broader economic forces, and what Mr. Dunkelberg calls the
''subset of services'' that a firm provides.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In retail, store margins are in general being squeezed by fierce
price competition. But some retailers are being hit harder than others,
like merchants at airports, who are among those most drastically
affected, said Randall S. Eisenberg, the chairman of the Turnaround
Management Association, a trade group of bankruptcy professionals, and a
senior managing director with FTI Consulting in New York. That is not
just because of lower prices, he said, but because of another outside
force: the precipitous drop in air travel.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, although a poor economy means that merger and acquisition
lawyers may be in a slump, it also means that bankruptcy lawyers are
doing quite well, said Leonard Z. Eppel, a turnaround specialist at
Financial Resource Associates in Cincinnati. So are businesses that deal
with residential real estate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
TAKE Vitek Mortgage Group, the company in Sacramento founded by Harry
Duncan and a friend 16 years ago. Nowadays, Vitek's business is better
than ever. It wrote $730 million worth of mortgages last year, according
to Mr. Duncan, and grew from 75 employees to 110. This year, ''we had
the best first quarter ever,'' he said, even though he had been afraid
that interest rates might rise and that the company's volume would go
down.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It just hasn't happened,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For Carolyn Brinkmeyer, the travel agent in Colorado, the opposite is
true. Although she concedes that hers has always been a tough industry,
it has gotten infinitely worse during the five years she has operated
her business, Serenity Travel. Between the rise of direct ticket sales
by airlines, online ticket services and the dropoff in travel, ''it felt
like a constant battle,'' Ms. Brinkmeyer said. ''When I calculated how
many hours I was working versus what I was making, I thought I needed my
head examined.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So, like thousands of other travel agents nationwide, she has given
up. Earlier this year, she closed her business and is now only handling
existing bookings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Iris Shokoff's company, Iris Shokoff Associates, offers direct market
media services to other businesses. Her customers include book and
record clubs, a gourmet food business and Guthy-Renker, a telemarketer.
Though ''things are not necessarily fabulous,'' Ms. Shokoff said, she is
predicting ''a good year.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Her company negotiates for newspaper and magazine space and radio and
television time for clients' advertisements, and it has benefited from a
softness in media markets, especially among print outlets. ''We can cut
deals,'' she said. ''Costs are less now than they were in the dot-com
era, when prices were outrageous.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But although the Internet bust has been advantageous to Ms. Shokoff,
it has not done much for John Chua, the president of Digital Gear, a Web
site development company. Most of Digital Gear's customers are ''big to
medium-size companies that are having challenges,'' Mr. Chua said.
Because the main issue for these companies is cash flow, Mr. Chua said
that he also had to become more flexible about pricing and payment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company, which began feeling the effects of the dot-com meltdown
in 2001, has shrunk from about 20 full-time employees to 15, and it no
longer uses expensive independent contractors. Instead, Mr. Chua said,
he often hires temporary workers, who can be hired for less.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We are very careful to watch expenses,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If there is one common feature, after size, that most small
businesses share today, it is a bunker mentality. If growth was the
mantra in the 90's, prudence and restraint are the watchwords now.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Small firms have to be more responsive and more nimble than ever,''
said Barbara Beck, the executive vice president of United States and
Canadian operations for Manpower, the temporary-employment company. Her
company provides interim staffing to numerous small businesses, Mr.
Chua's among them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manpower also conducts a quarterly employment outlook survey, polling
thousands of companies, big and small. Its most recent report indicated
that in 8 of 10 categories, hiring intentions were softer for the
current quarter than they were three months earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Small companies, Ms. Beck said, are assessing their hiring needs more
carefully than ever before, and that is unlikely to change soon.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That is a conclusion that dovetails with the results of small
business surveys recently conducted by Mr. Dunkelberg. And it sounds
pretty accurate to small-company owners like Mr. Chua.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''My feeling is that we will be all right in the end,'' Mr. Chua
said. ''We just need to hunker down for the next couple of years.''

PALO ALTO, Calif. -- IN March 2000, it took only 10 days for Thomas
E. Rowley, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur for more than two decades, to
raise $27 million for Counterpane Internet Security, his eighth start-up
company. Mr. Rowley's next round of financing was completed in January
2003 -- after eight months and 102 pitches that raised $20 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And most of his fellow entrepreneurs would consider him lucky.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This is an awful time for companies looking to recapitalize,'' Mr.
Rowley said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is not that the boom times, when venture capitalists often avoided
performing due diligence on companies in their rush to close deals, are
gone. And it is not that entrepreneurs must once again show that they
have proven business models, strong customer prospects and experienced
management teams. That, after all, was how venture capital always
worked, until the bubble. The big problem for new companies now is that
even when they do everything right, there is precious little money to
win.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The amount of money that venture capitalists have sunk into privately
held technology companies has declined every quarter since the start of
2000, according to the MoneyTree survey, a study of venture capital
investment activity compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Venture
Economics and the National Venture Capital Association. The survey's
figures for the most recent quarter, ending March 31, had the smallest
number of venture capital deals, 623, since the summer quarter of 1996.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Moreover, there has been one public stock offering for a venture
capital-backed company since January, down from 262 for 2000, the
MoneyTree survey reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last August, Jonathan Abrams, a 33-year-old software engineer, began
a start-up business, Friendster, an online dating and networking
service. He said that he was ''bootstrapping'' the business, running it
from his apartment in Sunnyvale, Calif. ''I'm not even bothering to
schmooze with venture capitalists right now,'' Mr. Abrams said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Abrams is more fortunate than many technology entrepreneurs. He
said that he was able to raise some money -- an amount he only said was
less than $500,000 -- from friends and former colleagues.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Raising capital from ''angels,'' wealthy individuals who invest in
start-up companies, has long been an avenue for brand-new technology
businesses, but the competition for this financing has become tougher.
Ian Sobieski, who coordinates the activities of one such Silicon Valley
network, the Band of Angels, said that the group had always heard
pitches from entrepreneurs who were turning an idea into a company.
Lately, however, he said they were seeing more venture-backed technology
businesses that have been around for a few years and need another round
of financing, but cannot raise the full sum from venture capitalists.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many young companies, unable to raise money from angels or venture
capitalists, are financing their dreams themselves. Their owners are
taking the maximum on their credit cards, cashing out I.R.A.'s and
acquiring second mortgages. A multimedia software designer at one Bay
Area business, who asked not to be identified, was helping to support
his two partners and paying for the lawyer to patent their work by
spending all his time composing music for electronic games.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a big shift, many entrepreneurs here are turning to the government
as a financing option. Workshops on obtaining government grants and
contracts have become as common in Silicon Valley in 2003 as they were
rare during the boom.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For those who find venture capital financing, the investments are
smaller, and the venture capitalists expect that money to last years,
not months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Matt Glickman, the chief executive and a co-founder of Merced Systems
in Redwood City, Calif., raised a first round of $3.5 million in venture
capital financing at the end of 2001. As part of the pitch for the
company, which sells software to monitor call centers, Mr. Glickman said
he presented testimonials from two customers, including a division of
the General Electric Company.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since raising the money, Merced Systems has gone 17 months without
seeking another round, quickly increasing its sales while pinching every
penny. That was different a few years ago, when Mr. Glickman was running
an online retailer, BabyCenter .com, which is now a subsidiary of
Johnson &amp; Johnson. During the late 90's, BabyCenter raised new rounds of
venture capital every nine months. ''Merced Systems has to be focused on
reaching sustainability,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are still a few instances of the go-for-broke mentality.
WildBlue, a communications company in Greenwood Village, Colo., which is
trying to develop a system to deliver wireless broadband access to the
Internet through new satellite technology, closed a $156 million round
of financing last month. The deal included new investors, Intelsat and
the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, in addition to
previous investors -- Liberty Media Corporation and Kleiner, Perkins,
Caufield &amp; Byers, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although WildBlue raised more than $300 million before 2001, it had
run out of cash one year later and suspended the development of its
network. ''We then spent all of our time trying to raise money,'' said
Thomas Moore, WildBlue's chief executive.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company also had to wait for rivals to die. ''It took two years
to let that play through,'' said Russell Siegelman, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins who sits on WildBlue's board of directors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Cowan, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners in Menlo Park,
Calif., said that in addition to new wireless technologies, he saw only
a few other niches still attracting venture capital. One is computer
network security, he said, which is why he invested in Mr. Rowley's
company, Counterpane. Counterpane sells systems to monitor computer
networks of businesses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Mr. Cowan, who has invested in Counterpane's previous rounds of
financing and is on its board, also took into account how Mr. Rowley and
others on the company's executive team managed start-ups through hard
economic times. ''The prevailing metric now is capital efficiency,'' Mr.
Cowan said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Howard Clowes, a lawyer at Gray Cary who handles venture capital
deals, said he told first-time entrepreneurs not to bother venture
capitalists until they hooked up with an experienced manager.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Rowley said that such demands are a sign that the venture capital
business was returning to normal. As a result, Counterpane was given a
lower market value in its last round, he said, declining to specify the
amount. Although that was painful to accept, he added that it was better
than the alternative: no money at all.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 5 -- Lacking the votes he needs in the Senate
for his tax cut plan, President Bush stopped here today on his way back
to Washington from his ranch in Texas to campaign for the plan and to
put direct pressure on a Democratic opponent, Senator Blanche Lincoln of
Arkansas.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush never mentioned Ms. Lincoln's name, but he urged his
audience -- mostly Republican supporters and small-business owners in a
state that he narrowly won in 2000 -- to contact their Congressional
delegations to push his plan.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Lincoln, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which will
take up the legislation this week. issued a statement this afternoon
that left the president little room for hope.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Arkansans need to know,'' she said, ''that the president's proposal
to eliminate taxes on dividends is simply too expensive and just won't
work for them.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush, in his speech here and in a similar one on Friday in Santa
Clara, Calif., described his plans as job generators, especially for
small businesses. Today, he appeared to go slightly further, at one
moment describing his proposal as one of a series of tax reductions to
come.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's not just a onetime shot,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We're talking $2,000 a year until we lower taxes again,'' he added,
a reference to the savings projected for one of the owners of a small
business at the speech.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bush said he was ''concerned about the deficit,'' an issue that
has given pause to many in his own party, but he added he was ''first
and foremost concerned about that person looking for a job.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tonight, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance
Committee, told fellow Republicans that he would offer a skeletal tax
plan of his own on Tuesday that would include neither a reduction in
taxes on stock dividends, a central element of the Bush proposal, nor
new aid to the states, an important issue to some swing-state senators.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other senators said Mr. Grassley hoped to buy two days of time to
pressure other senators before his panel meets to draft legislation on
Thursday. But so far, senators seem locked into positions, and that
means the president is at least two votes shy of a majority in the
Senate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee plans to take up and
almost certainly approve a $550 billion 10-year tax cut that follows the
president's prescription with one important exception. Instead of
eliminating the tax on dividends as the president proposed, the House
bill would reduce the tax on dividends and capital gains, to 15 percent.
Dividends are now taxed at the same rate as income from salaries and
wages, as high as 38.6 percent. Most capital gains are taxed at 18
percent or 20 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Senate, Mr. Grassley is bound by a budget that limits the
total 10-year tax cut to $350 billion. He was under pressure today to
include in that package some measure on stock dividends, said people at
a meeting of all Republican senators. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi
said there was overwhelming sentiment among fellow Republicans for the
proposal.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance
Committee, who is usually in close touch with Mr. Grassley, said he
expected Mr. Grassley to add such a measure, perhaps a temporary cut, a
process called sunsetting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As of tonight, there did not seem to be enough votes on the committee
for its approval. The panel has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats. All the
Democrats could be expected to vote against it, and Senator Olympia J.
Snowe, Republican of Maine, said she, too, would vote against a sunset
provision.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's just a gimmick,'' Ms. Snowe said.

SAN JOSE, Calif., May 8 -- Last month, eBay, the Internet auction
company, brought some welcome news to a city and region that have been
suffering from one of the worst office market slumps in the nation. The
eight-year-old company, which had toyed with giving up its headquarters
here, announced that it would not only keep its West San Jose complex
but would also buy a 32-acre campus from the software developer Novell
on the opposite side of town.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The eBay deal, which still must undergo an environmental review,
would allow the company to expand gradually, thereby avoiding the
mistakes made by other highflying Silicon Valley companies that
overcommitted themselves during the economic boom of the late 1990's and
are now stuck with empty or only partly occupied buildings because of
the slide in the technology industry.
  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Almost half of the 511,000 square feet of space in the five
aluminum-and-steel buildings of the Novell campus is leased, leaving
just 260,000 square feet for eBay to occupy in the immediate future. The
company won several unusually generous concessions from the city that
will allow further expansion to as much as two million square feet.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But should eBay stop growing, said the city's economic development
director, Paul Krutko, the company will be able to sell its development
rights. ''This deal also provides an exit strategy for eBay,'' Mr.
Krutko said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Though the eBay deal lifted spirits, especially among city officials,
it will have little effect on vacancy rates in the Silicon Valley, which
by its broadest definition includes Santa Clara County, where San Jose
is located; San Mateo County; and Fremont, in southern Alameda County.
Santa Clara County alone has lost 200,000 jobs since 2000, about half of
the job loss in the entire state. Evidence of the downturn is everywhere
-- from the empty parking lots in front of office parks that are only a
few years old, to the quiet atmosphere of downtown San Jose and the
easily flowing traffic along freeways that were once congested.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A newly completed 17-story blue-and-tan skyscraper near the San Jose
Convention Center that can be seen for miles has no tenants for its
380,000 square feet, and Boston Properties has shelved plans to put up
three buildings across the street with a total 850,000 square feet, said
Bob Pester, the regional manager for the developer.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of the valley's 166.7 million square feet of space for
high-technology research and development, 21.3 percent was vacant as of
the end of the last quarter, compared with 2.3 percent for the peak of
the market in the second quarter of 2000, said Charles W. Harry Jr., the
managing director of the analytics advisory group for Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, the national real estate company. The vacancy rate for the
office market of about 70.9 million square feet stands at 27.8 percent,
compared with 1.8 percent three years ago, he said. The vacancy rate for
the high-technology market is the worst it has been since the second
quarter of 1993 while the office market has not been this soft since the
first quarter of 1987, Mr. Harry said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The numbers may not be the worst ever, but with 14 million square
feet of high-technology space added in just a few years, many people in
the industry expect the recovery to take a frustratingly long time.
''This is the worst market in the Silicon Valley that we've ever seen,''
said Raymond W. Marino, the president of Mission West Properties, a
publicly traded real estate investment trust that manages 7.8 million
square feet, primarily in Silicon Valley. ''In all prior downturns,
we've always had a new company that was just coming into its own. This
time, everyone is just stalled.''
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Average annual asking rents in the research and development market
were $15.41 a square foot in the last quarter, compared with a peak of
$57.13 at the end of 2000, Mr. Harry said. In the office market, rents
have dropped to $27.34 from a height of $69.68, according to Cushman &amp;
Wakefield. C. Michael Kamm, the chief executive of BT Commercial, a
Northern California company, said ''rents have fallen to levels we
haven't seen in seven or eight years.''
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As their need for space evaporated, some companies paid dearly to get
out of their leases. It cost Handspring, the personal organizer
manufacturer, $75 million to extricate itself from plans to move from
Mountain View to Sunnyvale, said Brian Jaquot, a company spokesman.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But in Silicon Valley, as in other high-technology areas, the typical
lease runs only 5 to 7 years rather than 10 to 15 years. So while space
available for sublease accounts for a substantial portion of the
vacancies right now -- 13.2 million of the 35 million square feet of
empty research-and-development space, according to BT Commercial -- many
of those leases will expire in a year or two, shifting the burden for
filling the space from tenants to landlords.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In anticipation, many landlords and tenants are working deals to
''blend and extend'' their leases, in brokers' jargon. Mr. Marino said
he was working out one such deal with a San Jose technology company that
needed only 45,000 of the 120,000 square feet that it had leased until
September 2004. Under the proposed new terms, the company would extend
its lease for the 45,000 square feet at market rates through May 31,
2008, and the $2.3 million in rent due on the remaining 75,000 square
feet would be spread out (with an undisclosed amount of interest added)
over the five-year term.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One measure of how bad things are, said James J. Curtis III, a
partner in Bristol Group, a real estate investment company, is that some
buildings used to command annual leases of $70 a square foot (without
utilities); now space is being sold at the same price.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That is slightly more than the South Bay Development Company of
Campbell, Calif., paid for an empty 359,000-square-foot building in the
city of Santa Clara that it acquired in August from Nortel Networks.
Built in 1975, the building was completely remodeled in 1999 at a cost
of $100 a square foot, said Mark J. Regoli, a South Bay partner.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In November, his company bought a 78,000-square-foot property in
Sunnyvale for $5 million; the seller, Qwest communications, had paid
$25.2 million for the building the previous December, he said. ''For
us,'' Mr. Regoli said, ''we view the next 6 to 24 months as a good
opportunity to accumulate.''
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Real estate prices have fallen so far that the 3Com Corporation, a
leading maker of computer-networking equipment, recently took its
900,000-square-foot Santa Clara campus off the market. Brokers and
investors said the company could not even get an offer of $100 a square
foot, about one-third of what the complex cost to build. EBay has not
disclosed what it paid for the landscaped Novell campus, which includes
a reflecting pool; tennis, volleyball and basketball courts; jogging
paths; a gymnasium; and an espresso cafe as well as a cafeteria. But one
real estate specialist familiar with the negotiations said it fetched
just under $185 a square foot.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
San Jose city officials were so eager to keep eBay in town that they
abandoned their plans to buy an adjacent 15-acre vacant site from Novell
to use in connection with a major airport expansion program. Instead,
Novell will sell the land to eBay.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As an Internet company, eBay does not generate sales tax revenue for
San Jose, but it has 1,500 employees who spend their paychecks locally,
Mr. Krutko said. ''EBay is what you call a 'gazelle company,' '' Mr.
Krutko said, ''It doubles in size every five years. There are very few
of those companies around.''

BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 14 -- As the Bush administration rushes to
jump-start the reconstruction of postwar Iraq, it may want to consider
the recent woes of Pete Henderson.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Henderson, a South African entrepreneur, thought last week that
he had lined up everything he needed to start Air Baghdad, the first
commercial air service into and out of Iraq since the war.
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Henderson had flight approval from American military commanders
to operate his first route between Baghdad and Amman, Jordan. He had a
plane and crew. Because armed gangs are attacking and killing road
travelers with increasing frequency, he had throngs of customers ready
to pay one-way fares of $650. He even had insurance from Lloyd's of
London.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But just as the first passengers were ready to board his 50-seat
commuter plane last Thursday, Air Baghdad was grounded. The decision
boiled down to this: he was moving too early to make a profit and might
get a jump on his competitors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''No flights for profit or commercial purposes will be approved,''
wrote Lt. Col. David Jones, the senior adviser on Iraqi civil aviation
at the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, in an
e-mail message to Mr. Henderson on Tuesday. Any attempt to cloak flights
as ''humanitarian,'' he added, ''will be dealt with harshly.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Henderson, sitting in a tent that he has equipped with
electricity and high-speed Internet access by satellite, said he was
dumbfounded.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I'm putting up my own money,'' he said. ''I'm offering a service
that is badly needed and could save lives. I would have thought people
would say, 'Great, glad you're here.' ''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many other entrepreneurs are having the same experience. With
ordinary telephone service all but nonexistent in much of the country,
and likely to remain so for months, many companies want to roll out
cellular phone systems that they say could be operating within weeks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But American administrators say they will not license any commercial
mobile telephone services, even temporarily, until they have a
comprehensive regulatory system to govern issues from what they call
''interoperability'' to telephone numbers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, Iraq's biggest pharmaceutical company, Dofar
Pharmaceuticals, says it has large inventories of antibiotics and other
medicines but remains unable to sell them because it cannot figure out
whom to deal with in the American-led office of reconstruction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That office, which is supposed to oversee the rebuilding of Iraq, is
in the midst of an overhaul. Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general
who has been in charge, is being replaced by L. Paul Bremer III, a
presidential envoy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's been very difficult,'' said one exasperated American business
consultant. ''You can waste three hours a day walking around the halls
trying to talk to people.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The upshot is that Iraqis are left to rely on their own creativity
and limited resources. Small shopkeepers, though enduring horrendous
economic conditions, are paying $700 or more for satellite phones so
they can order products from other countries or from across town. These
phones are not only expensive but also tricky to use because they have
to be pointed at a satellite to receive calls.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To make up for the absence of Iraqi television, dark since the war,
people have been buying satellite dishes and receivers to pull in
signals from Iran, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But home-grown adaptability goes only so far. Many essential
services, from telephones to airlines, require government approval. Many
others, including the rebuilding of buildings, utilities and telephone
networks, require government money.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Henderson, 41, was not looking for government money, but he knew
he needed approval. A former television cameraman, he spent most of his
career supplying crews and logistical services to news organizations
covering the first Persian Gulf war, the Balkan wars and various
conflicts in Africa.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But after selling his company, Newsforce, to France Telecom several
years ago, Mr. Henderson settled into comfortable homes in Kenya and
Britain. After the United States ousted the Iraqi government, he arrived
here to set up satellite communications to the headquarters of the Iraqi
National Congress, a party built by returning Iraqi exiles under Ahmad
Chalabi.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The urge to set up a commuter air service to Jordan occurred to Mr.
Henderson almost five weeks ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The highway from Amman to Baghdad has long been a favored route to
Iraq, but it has become increasingly dangerous. In the past few weeks,
trucks owned by CNN, CBS and The Associated Press have been attacked,
and one CNN employee was shot in the hand.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Business executives and journalists have become increasingly
reluctant to make the drive.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Henderson first pitched his idea for Air Baghdad to the American
Regional Air Mobilization Control Center in Qatar, which approved his
plans for a round-trip flight for last Thursday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But he was blocked by Colonel Jones, who told him that the
reconstruction office was waiting for an ''assessment'' of the airport,
due June 1, and that final clearance might take another month after
that.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As discussions continued, said Mr. Henderson, Colonel Jones argued
that Air Baghdad would get an unfair advantage over competitors if it
began operations early. Mr. Henderson then proposed limiting the flights
to journalists and designating the flights a humanitarian effort.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But that fell on deaf ears as well, and on Tuesday Mr. Henderson was
pessimistic about carrying off his next scheduled flight on Thursday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other airlines are also trying to offer service to and from Baghdad.
British Air said it would be ready to resume flights to the capital by
June 1, though it appears unlikely they will stay on schedule if
American officials insist on completing their airport assessment by June
1.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, at least two wealthy Iraqi families are organizing their
own air service.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The roadblocks to offering mobile telephone service may be even more
daunting. Despite the near obliteration of telephone service in Baghdad,
and only limited service in other cities, American officials have so far
approved only the construction of a private network that could be used
by United States government workers, Iraqi government ministries and
perhaps some aid agencies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stephen Browning, the senior adviser to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communication, said this week that commercial
services would not be approved for ''probably two months, at the
minimum.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Browning said American officials were reluctant to give valuable
radio licenses before an interim Iraqi government was in place.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AT&amp;T, Turkcell of Turkey and several Iraqi entrepreneurs are among
many groups that have already organized truckloads of cellular equipment
in nearby countries that they could deploy around Baghdad and turn into
a functioning system.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Asked why American officials could not simply award cellular licenses
that would only be valid for a year or two, allowing the new Iraqi
government to issue permanent licenses, Mr. Browning said the decision
was outside his control.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''These are decisions that are going to be made in Washington,'' he
said.

His store is open every day of the week. And holidays too, including Christmas. He is even open during snowstorms, like the time last winter when Verona got hit with 29 inches.

His son Joseph took over and kept the streak going until his own retirement in 2000, when he sold the business to Mr. Patel.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, Henry's has opened every day since the beginning of 1930, a total of 73 years, or 26,843 days and counting. It is probably some kind of record, and if it's not, it should be.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Patel, who started working on his father's businesses in India when he was 16, expects to keep up his brutal schedule for 10 more years, by which time his three children will be on their own. Then, he said, he and his wife will ''just take a rest,'' though he expects he will continue to get up at 4 a.m. out of habit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone once defined an entrepreneur as a person willing to work 16 hours a day so they don't have to work 8 hours a day for someone else. Managing time is one of the single most important determinants, besides money, of a new business's success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Time and time management are definitely on the list of success factors,'' for a small business, said Kris Solie-Johnson, president of the the American Institute of Small Business, a book company in Minneapolis that publishes ''How to Set Up Your Own Small Business,'' an 850-page reference work carried by many local libraries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the national economy has slowed, the number of people starting their own business has risen. According to the United States Small Business Administration, 550,100 new firms were opened in 2002.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it takes more than a clever idea or original concept to build a new business. Only about half of newly created firms survive at least four years, and miscalculating the amount of time required is to blame for many failures.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We always advise people that before going into business they should put together a business plan that gives a more realistic sense of what the real time commitment is going to be,'' said Miguel Centeno, a public affairs officer for the Small Business Administration office in New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Small Business Administration also runs a counseling service for entrepreneurs called the Service Corps of Retired Executives, or SCORE, (  www.score.org[http://www.score.org]) which can help answer questions and give advice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Running a small business isn't hard,'' said Martin R. Lehman, a retired retailer with SCORE, ''it's 25 hours a day.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who do not have the stamina for 80-hour weeks with or without scotch, Ms. Solie-Johnson offered a few time management hints. She uses an online payroll service that produces time savings enough to more than compensate for the small fee she pays. And she turns off her cellphone while driving the 45 minutes to and from work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry J. Coleman, owner of Alchemy Answers, an online service that provides information and advice for small businessmen (  www.alchemyanswers.com[http://www.alchemyanswers.com]) along with several retail businesses, said he learned some fundamental rules about time management after putting in 100-hour weeks trying to get a stock brokerage going.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lesson I learned is that time management is not deciding what to do but what not to do,'' he said. ''Once you do that, it's amazing how much time you create.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of putting together a to-do list, Mr. Coleman, who now runs five different companies, prepares a list of things that are not his responsibility. ''I knew from Day 1 that my time would be finite,'' he said. ''I refused to build an enterprise where the only way to grow was for me to put in one more hour. Once you start down that road, there is no end.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, July 1 -- Pessimism about the Japanese economy is slowly fading, a central bank survey of business executives showed today, as manufacturers prepare for an increase in orders from overseas for their cars, electronics and machinery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of Japan's quarterly ''tankan'' report suggests that concerns about the world's second-largest economy sliding into recession are overblown. Though the large manufacturers that typically drive economic recoveries here remain wary, they are quietly raising their profit and capital spending goals.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll's index of major manufacturers rose five points to minus 5, which means pessimists still outnumbered optimists but by a smaller margin. The companies' financial outlooks were stronger than the predictions of private economists, who expected confidence to slip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement, however mild, comes as disruptions from the SARS virus and the war in Iraq fade, while oil prices slide and stock prices extend a two-month rally. The United States economy is also improving, good news for exporters like Honda Motor, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and other companies that earn most of their profits overseas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While corporate managers expect no improvement in confidence by the time of the next survey in September, manufacturers raised their pretax profit forecasts for the fiscal year that began in April. Some of that progress comes as companies reduce their payrolls, close factories and streamline balance sheets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But manufacturers are also preparing for new sales by planning to invest more in factories and operations. Large manufacturers, for instance, expect their capital spending to increase 11.5 percent this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economy is still at the mercy of exports,'' said Ryo Hino, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo. ''But the numbers suggest that the momentum is stronger than we thought.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's chief financial regulator, Heizo Takenaka, said the survey's results were within expectations, while the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, said the improvement at large manufacturers was ''an honest reflection'' of their restructuring efforts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors viewed today's news as a bullish sign for the economy. The Nikkei 225 stock index rose 2.2 percent to 9,278, a nine-month high. The dollar slipped against the yen after the report was released, but later recouped its losses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tankan's optimism was seconded by a separate report that showed new car sales rising 2.6 percent in June, the ninth gain in 10 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Japan's $4.2 trillion economy is showing signs of life, the recovery is far from robust. Domestic sales remain sluggish, and residents face a difficult job market, falling incomes and higher taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main culprit is deflation, or falling prices. While price declines help consumers in search of cheaper goods, they hurt the companies that make those products.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compensate, companies must reduce hiring and cut other fixed costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst-hit companies are those that compete with low-cost producers from China, South Korea and other Asian countries. While demand for cellphones, personal digital assistants and other electronics are strong, the prices of the components packed into these machines remain weak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think prices will improve this year because of the macroeconomy,'' said Yoshihide Fujii, executive vice president in charge of semiconductors at Toshiba, Japan's largest chipmaker. ''We have only one choice: To cut costs to cope with this.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the government has put together several antideflation spending packages and the Bank of Japan has followed an ultra-loose monetary policy for several years, prices are locked in their fifth year of decline.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Believe it or not, the little guys in the so-called outer boroughs could help revive New York City's economy. Small businesses have emerged as a strong growth sector in the city -- and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg should find new ways to support them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While financial services and other sectors still languish, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management-New York, small businesses, often owned and patronized by immigrants and minorities, have been growing. Leading this expansion are specialty and ethnic-food manufacturers, like the bakeries that produce rolls for high-end restaurants and sausage makers that serve immigrant neighborhoods. Over the last year the number of people these businesses employ grew by almost 8 percent -- probably more, since many firms go unreported.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food producers are only the most visible among many small-scale industries that are thriving and poised to expand. Evidence, albeit fragmentary, suggests there is growth in construction, specialty apparel, medical instruments and luxury consumer goods like jewelry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, New York offers few programs aimed at such businesses. To its credit, the city government recently announced it would develop 10 sites in Brooklyn and the Bronx for much-needed industrial space. There are also some tax incentives, like credits for utility bills and waivers for manufacturers trying to develop facilities. Reflecting New York's labyrinthine regulatory environment, the city also offers help dealing with its own agencies, including the departments of sanitation, health and police.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most small manufacturers, however, will not use these services. They are too busy running their business, and some may fear that if they contact the government, officials will interfere with their business or workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what can New York do to reach these business owners? A useful lesson can be found in Los Angeles, where in the early 1990's small manufacturers helped bring some prosperity to urban neighborhoods there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the devastation left by the riots of 1992, Los Angeles and California officials looked to large corporations to revive the city. As head of an ad hoc reconstruction agency, Peter Ueberroth (the former baseball commissioner and current candidate for governor of California) tried to persuade many chief executives to move some operations to the inner city. The oil, aerospace and movie industries were all staggering in the 1990's, however, and Mr. Ueberroth had little success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his successor, Linda Griego, sensed life in the inner city. Ms. Griego, a former chili stand operator and deputy mayor for economic development, commissioned a door-to-door survey of businesses operating in South Central Los Angeles and other forsaken areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To nearly everyone's surprise, inner-city Los Angeles turned out to be an industrial beehive. Its 15,000 companies employed more than 360,000 people -- mainly immigrants and minorities -- and generated more than $54 billion in sales annually of everything from tortillas to bicycling outfits. But -- as in New York -- most of the proprietors knew little about government programs and sometimes operated outside government rules.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Griego, along with the nonprofit Community Development Technologies Center and eventually the city government, adopted an unusual strategy to deal with the mom-and-pop entrepreneurs. They worked directly with the small manufacturers to help them organize trade associations, navigate government regulations and upgrade the skills of their workers. In the end, small manufactures succeeded where large industry failed: they helped rescue the economy of inner-city Los Angeles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Los Angeles is not New York. New York is far larger -- both in terms of population and the size of its government -- and it has not relied on industry to drive its economy the way Los Angeles has. But the Bloomberg administration can certainly do more to encourage small-scale manufacturing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, economic development officials must learn about the city's disparate manufacturers and identify the issues they face. Government officials, perhaps in cooperation with a business association or nonprofit group, should undertake a systematic study of small industry in the city -- mindful of the need for street-by-street canvassing because corporate records and permits may not reveal every business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having identified the most important industries, the city government could help organize trade associations. Since many small-business owners are so intently focused on their company, they are notoriously isolated from one another. Together, manufacturers can overcome their shared problems. Owners of small ethnic-food businesses in Los Angeles, for example, lobbied the state to block a steep hike in inspection fees -- something they could never have done without banding together.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's government should also go beyond the tax waivers and credits it now provides and actually reduce the taxes on small businesses. This would ensure that costs of operating in New York do not prevent companies from expanding -- and it would also increase the rate of tax collection because fewer businesses would dodge taxes. Finally, the Bloomberg administration should reduce the bureaucracy and red tape that often make running a legitimate enterprise in New York City a logistical nightmare.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By taking such steps, Mayor Bloomberg can unleash the energies of small-fry entrepreneurs busily operating in the boroughs -- and help them revive the economy of New York City.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- TO judge by the economic surveys that are published almost daily in Europe, the Continent is solidly on the road to recovery. So why are the people who study these barometers so dour?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is clear: Germany's influential Ifo index of business sentiment rose in September for the fifth consecutive month, to its highest level in more than two years.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ZEW survey of investor confidence, released by the ZEW Center for European Economic Research, and its consumer counterpart, the GfK survey, by the market research company GfK in Nuremberg, are also showing newfound vigor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upward-pointing arrows are not limited to Germany. In France, the closely watched Insee survey, by the national statistics office, recorded its second consecutive monthly improvement last week, after a long stretch of gloomy results.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet rather than proclaim a recovery under way, most economists warn that it is too soon to declare a turn in Europe's fortunes. Part of the caution stems from experience. Most of these surveys registered similar gains in sentiment last year, stoking hopes of a recovery that never materialized. Germany fell back into a mild recession last autumn, while the rest of Europe stagnated. ''People had their fingers burned,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope may again be sprinting ahead of reality. ''It's too early to say a recovery has arrived,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''For that, we'd like to see a turnaround in current conditions. Unfortunately, there is a considerable disparity between expectations and conditions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the Ifo index, which is published by the Ifo Institute, an economic research group in Munich. The index, a survey of 7,000 German companies, showed an improvement in sentiment in September. But it was driven by a rise in expectations for a better future, not on conditions today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the exception of a positive report on manufacturing orders last month, there is no tangible evidence -- in statistics like unemployment or retail sales -- that the German economy is moving. The disparity between emotions and evidence exists in France and other countries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the same day the new Insee survey was published, French officials lowered their estimates of gross domestic product in late 2002 and early 2003, which means their already modest goal of 0.5 percent growth this year is probably unattainable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts chalk this up to the normal cycle of an economic recovery. There was a similar lag between improved sentiment and tangible economic results in the United States, they said. ''Europe is at a much earlier stage,'' said David Abramson, the chief European strategist at the BCA Research Group in Montreal. Beyond issues of timing, however, the caution reflects a fear that this recovery is unusually fragile. The euro has renewed its climb against the dollar, which will put pressure on the German and French exports that are considered a crucial driver of any sustained growth in Europe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The euro is one of the major threats to the recovery,'' said Michael Heise, the chief economist at Allianz in Frankfurt. A sharply higher euro, he noted, could cause Europe's economies to succumb yet again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heise said he was encouraged that the German government had pushed ahead with politically painful reforms of the labor market, as well as of welfare and pension benefits. The government also cheered the public by accelerating a tax cut that had been scheduled for 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, too much good news on the economic front could pose a threat to the reform agenda of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. European leaders have tended to put their reform plans in mothballs during times of robust growth because they no longer appear as necessary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERHAPS the easiest way to deal with the curse of rising expectations would be to pay less attention to the alphabet soup of surveys. Ifo, ZEW, and GfK came to prominence partly because of the growth of financial markets. Investors like trading on the numbers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they also reflect the tardiness and unreliability of the economic data released by European governments. If Paris, Berlin and Rome issued timely, dependable statistics, Mr. Mayer said, the influence of these private surveys would ebb.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it is, he said, the surveys can even distort an economic cycle. Last year, after the flood of upbeat reports, the European Central Bank sent out hawkish signals about interest rates. That spooked investors, whose reactions may have contributed to the subsequent relapse of the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need a more balanced diet,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''If we live off these surveys, we'll get indigestion.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Eleven Inc., an upstart advertising agency that not only survived the Internet meltdown but went on to thrive in an industry that has been battered for years by weak corporate spending, has a big display chart that almost always makes prospective clients sit up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It shows how much more expensive it would be for them to pay for a few seconds of television advertising than for more mundane marketing vehicles like signs in stores, direct mail and even packaging that might hold consumers' attention for minutes or hours.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The chart starts the conversation about what medium really matters for a specific brand,'' said Rob Price, one of Eleven's founders and a co-chairman and creative director, as he takes a visitor to the agency's offices here through a typical Eleven sales pitch that skips the usual reel of television advertisements to focus on products like corporate videos that the agency has made for Kodak and corporate reports it has done for Williams-Sonoma.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not as though Eleven disdains television advertisements -- far from it. Rather, Mr. Price says, the company has elbowed its way into a profitable niche of a crowded market by being what he calls ''media agnostic.'' That means keeping egos -- and the desire to win advertising prizes -- at bay and homing in on those promotional outlets that will get the most bang for the client's buck, he said. It is an unsentimental approach, and one the founders contend sets Eleven off from all those hot Web shops and other specialized agencies that sprang up in the 1990's and went bust in 2001.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we had made the choice to be only a Web shop, a small ad agency or an integrated marketing firm, we wouldn't be here today,'' said Michael Borosky, vice president and a creative director, who left an interactive agency in 1999 to help found Eleven. ''We couldn't afford to be pigeonholed.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create Eleven, Mr. Borosky, with Jordan Warren -- a colleague at the formerly highflying Web shop CKS (which became MarchFirst and later filed for bankruptcy) -- joined Mr. Price and Paul Curtin, two former design directors at Goodby, Berlin, Silverstein &amp; Company, the advertising agency known for its ''Got Milk?'' campaign. They opened for business April 1, 1999, the height of the Internet boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four wanted to build an agency that was not just concerned with creating Web sites, producing big television campaigns or going public on the stock market but with focusing on brand strategy. They took the name from the film ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and the character Nigel Tufnel's explanation for why his amplifiers go to 11 settings instead of the traditional 10, ''It's one louder.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its first year, the agency snagged big Internet accounts including Petstore.com, which would become part of Pets.com (now defunct), and PeoplePC, which was bought by Earthlink. Then the Internet bubble burst, and times became tough.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't pay our dues in the beginning,'' Mr. Borosky said. ''We joke about having to go through another start-up phase in 2001. That year really forced us back into reality.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality was that too many agencies were vying for too few clients with the same old pitch of ''integrated marketing services,'' by which they generally meant making certain the brand looked the same across television, print and the Internet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure, that should happen, but that's homogenization, not integration,'' Mr. Warren, Eleven's president and chief executive, said. ''Integration should be where the media works together as part of the overall brand's strategy. The media should feed off each other.'' Mr. Curtin is co-chairman and a creative director.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agnostic strategy, coupled with the creative strengths of all four founders, has brought Eleven some big clients in the last two years, including Microsoft and Kodak's digital camera business. It has also lured small clients, like the financial software company Hyperion, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., who do not want to spend huge sums on television advertising.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren estimates Eleven's revenues will rise to $6 million this year -- equivalent to $40 million in ''billings,'' the measure of performance favored by the industry -- from $4.9 million last year and $3.8 million in 2001.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competitors say being small may make it easier for Eleven to practice its agnostic approach to media, but they agree that picking the best media for the client's brand -- not the one that will pay the most or stroke the biggest egos -- is really what agencies need to do. But it is not easy, especially for very large agencies with ingrained biases toward certain media. ''It's both a structural as well as philosophical change that has to happen,'' said Betsy Sperry, managing partner with Grey San Francisco, a unit of the Grey Global Group, which in the last year combined advertising, media buying, direct response and interactive into one profit-and-loss center to help it move to a more agnostic model. ''Old habits die hard, you have to make structural changes to break down those barriers,'' Ms. Sperry said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven is not afraid to try unusual methods to get its point across. To impress on Hyperion marketing executives the need to broaden their company's appeal beyond the technology-obsessed, it put the company's name on jargon-riddled advertisements it had lifted from trade magazines. The executives loved them -- at which point Eleven confessed to the subterfuge and said it was time for a change in an industry that was suffering huge losses as companies pulled back from technology spending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then it pitched its idea: spend big on a funny print campaign with a long text in The Wall Street Journal intended to reach chief executives and high-level technology executives who increasingly were making the purchasing decisions. One of the first advertisements would read, ''It is our considered opinion that software advertising ... is increasingly burdened with tired buzzwords and meaningless drivel.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suggested campaign and media purchase rang true with Hyperion's vice president for corporate marketing, Kathi Fox, who knew that chief executives and chief financial officers were making software decisions and that they disliked mumbo jumbo.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attacking jargon also was at the heart of the strategy Eleven proposed for promoting Kodak's digital cameras. In 2000, most advertising for digital cameras was full of technical information and boring shots of the cameras. It played well with the first wave of enthusiasts, who ''love to dive into the technicalities,'' said Pierre Schaeffer, chief marketing officer for Kodak's digital-imaging division.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the future lay in mainstream consumers, particularly women, who wanted ease of operation. Kodak had a product called EasyShare that fitted the bill, but it needed a marketing campaign to go with it. Eleven created a Web site, signs in stores, packaging and even stickers to go on the cameras that conveyed the point of simplicity by showing people using the camera. It also bucked convention by showing the camera from the back, not the front in all the marketing materials. ''The back of the camera is what people see when they take photos, it shows them the image they are capturing,'' Mr. Warren said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eleven marketing campaign has been so successful -- Kodak credits Eleven's work with helping it become one of the top three digital camera brands with Sony and Olympus -- that its theme, simplicity, has been picked up by Kodak's primary agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, for advertising. But Mr. Schaeffer of Kodak said Eleven's real success had been to refocus the brand, even if that made him uneasy at times. ''I remember it took a leap of faith for me to O.K. showing the back of the camera,'' he said. ''But now I realized that's where the journey begins for the consumer.''   </p>

The open weave of the panels, made in Marrakesh, makes them seem fragile, but she said they are surprisingly strong. Most Moroccan weavers are men, and she said that except for Mr. Foukahi, ''men don't want to work for a woman.'' So she trained two women to help.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence tumbled in February as persistent worries about jobs tarnished Americans' optimism, an industry group reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped more than 9 points, to 87.3, after a rise in January to a revised reading of 96.4. That reading was the index's highest since mid-2002. Analysts expected a decline, but the index came in significantly below their consensus forecast of 92.3.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumers began the year on a high note, but their optimism has quickly given way to caution,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. ''Consumers remain disheartened with current economic conditions, and at the core of their disenchantment is the labor market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The confidence reading is watched closely because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy. The decline in confidence is a sign that consumers are disturbed by changes in the job market, which have quickly become a crucial issue in the presidential campaign, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The labor market is actually improving, not very rapidly, but it's improving,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Company in Minneapolis. ''But the perception is otherwise.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in confidence reflects consumer uncertainty over both the current business climate and economic conditions in the next six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, an index measuring consumers' assessment of current conditions declined to 73.1, from 79.4 in January. Those describing the present climate as good declined to 19.3 percent, from 21.9 percent in January. Those who said conditions were bad increased to 25.1 percent, from 22.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sentiment on jobs was similarly depressed, with those saying positions are hard to get rising to 32.1 percent, from 31.6 percent, while those saying jobs are plentiful slipped to 11.8 percent, from 12.3 percent.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment has unexpectedly risen this month, suggesting that tax refunds and an accelerating economy are giving Americans reasons for optimism even as job growth lags.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment for March rose to 95.8, from 94.4 in February. Economists had expected a final reading of 93.7 in the gauge, according to the median of 52 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The preliminary reading for March was 94.1.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income tax rebates are up 5 percent on average from last year and forecasts call for the fastest pace of economic growth in two decades. That may be helping to buoy consumers until companies step up the pace of hiring. Declines in the stock market, a surge in gasoline prices and the March 11 terrorist attack in Madrid still weighed on attitudes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We suspect that soaring tax refunds are offsetting the Madrid effect, as well as the impact of higher gas prices and the dip in stocks,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. Rising sentiment ''will help perceptions of the strength of the recovery.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Commerce Department yesterday said spending by consumers rose 0.2 percent in February, the fifth consecutive increase, after a 0.5 percent gain in January. Incomes rose 0.4 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final Michigan index is based on a survey of about 500 households, double the sample size of the preliminary finding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's expectations index, which measures optimism about the next one to five months, rose to 88.8, from 88.5 a month earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-conditions index, based on perceptions of consumers' financial situation and whether it is a good time to make major purchases, rose to 106.8, from 103.6 in February.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Howard Anderson was a student at Harvard Business School in the late 1960's, it was a given that he and his classmates would graduate and take jobs as executives at Fortune 500 companies. His professors took a dim view of striking out on your own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They always treated entrepreneurs like there was something wrong with them,'' recalled Mr. Anderson, who, after a few ill-fated interviews with recruiters for corporations like the Ford Motor Company, started the Yankee Group, a high-technology market-research firm in Boston.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Harvard flaunts its entrepreneurship program, as does the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Mr. Anderson now teaches. Business schools in general have gone giddy with entrepreneurship. In 1970 there were 16 entrepreneurship programs nationwide; as of 2000, about 1,500 universities and colleges offered such courses. .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the numbers, this should be the best time in history to learn about starting a small business. But what an entrepreneurial education means depends a lot on the school.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top-tier business schools like Harvard and M.I.T. emphasize the entrepreneurial mind-set rather than the details of being a small-business owner. The nuts and bolts of keeping a small venture going are left to the community colleges and Small Business Administration programs. And somewhere in between are schools that instill their entrepreneurship programs with a healthy dose of small-business basics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students who come to the Sloan School of Management are not looking to be ''lifestyle entrepreneurs,'' who are small-business owners content to keep their businesses healthy but not necessarily wealthy. ''We want them to aim higher,'' Mr. Anderson said. About 15 percent of his students have patents in their own names, and while their ventures may start out small, few intend to stay that way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason to separate entrepreneurship from small-business management, Mr. Anderson said, is that founders and managers are often different species. Although he himself founded and ran the Yankee Group for 30 years, he does not see himself as the norm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once a company is up and running it takes a different set of expertise,'' he said. ''Very few people are both the entrepreneur and the guy to run it for the next 40 years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson does teach practicalities, of course. M.I.T.'s entrepreneurship classes focus on all the crucial steps of a venture, like putting out the fires that start-ups face. For example, what happens if your product does not work, or what happens if your partners quit on you?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the George Washington University's School of Business and Public Management, some students intend to be the next Bill Gates. Others are simply preparing to take over the family business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We try to imbue in our students entrepreneurial spirit and then couple that with good small-business management,'' said Charles N. Toftoy, director of the school's entrepreneurship and small-business program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Toftoy teams his undergraduate and graduate students with small to medium-size businesses in the Washington area, from hair salons to software companies, where they help the owners solve their biggest problems. They have assisted more than 2,100 companies with issues like competitor analysis, cash-flow management and inventory control.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've helped businesses arrange their parking spaces,'' Dr. Toftoy said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As business majors at George Washington, Michael Goldman and four other students were assigned to help a local Salvadoran restaurant. The owner's first request was that the students translate the menu into English. ''Then she wanted us to figure out a way to make more money,'' Mr. Goldman said. The team helped her place advertisements in the local Spanish-language newspaper and recruit people to hand out coupons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Goldman, now 23 and a real estate broker at the Ezra Company in Bethesda, Md., has no interest in starting his own restaurant, the experience gave him a full notebook to consult should he some day start his own company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason schools may overlook the small-business side of entrepreneurship is that few small-business owners go back to school for a business degree. Most simply do not have the time. In 1997, Charles Kendall signed up as a full-time M.B.A. student at George Washington, but as the owner of a small video-production business, the founder of a fledgling video-equipment company and a father expecting his second child, he had one too many sleepless nights to continue past the first year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kendall, 35, who is now a father of three and owner of Moon Bounce Media in Herndon, Va., and Spider Support Systems in Reston, Va., returned to the university in 2000, this time ''going real slow'' with one or two courses each semester. As he expands his businesses, he appreciates both sides of the entrepreneurship and small-business program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kendall said his father, who turned his own small business into a company with 4,000 employees, inspired him. ''He prodded me to get the M.B.A.,'' he said. ''It has opened my eyes to the opportunities.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even without enrolling at a business school, small-business owners have traditionally had plenty of informal ways to get an education. Colleges of all sizes offer certificate programs and continuing education classes geared toward small-business owners. In addition, the Small Business Administration sponsors Small Business Development Centers at 1,100 locations, many of them at colleges and universities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller educational institutions are building on those relationships. Millikin University in Decatur, Ill., has worked for years with local small businesses through the on-campus chapter of the Service Corps of Retired Executives, a partner of the Small Business Administration. In the 1990's the university's Tabor School of Business began to translate that experience into its curriculum by offering classes like small-business consulting and entrepreneurial management strategy, and in 1998 a Center for Entrepreneurship was founded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millikin is developing an entrepreneurship and art program, where art, music, theater and dance students learn about turning their talents into personal businesses. A cornerstone of the program is the Blue Connection, a commercial art gallery that sells works created by Millikin students, faculty and alumni.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have an engineering department, but we do have a wonderful school of fine arts,'' said Sharon T. Alpi, an assistant professor of business administration and the director of the entrepreneurship center. ''It made sense to us to look at how we can integrate entrepreneurship not only in the business school, but how can we make it part of Millikin as a whole.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, an organization in Kansas City, Mo., that encourages entrepreneurship, is also pushing to make entrepreneurship classes more accessible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of American entrepreneurs do not come out of business schools, said Carl J. Schramm, the foundation's president and chief executive, and, yet, unless you are a business major, ''The hardest place to take a course is often in the business school.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, the foundation recently awarded $25 million in grants to eight universities that pledged to make entrepreneurial education available across their campus, not just to business majors.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, April 1 -- Executives at Japan's biggest manufacturers are more optimistic about business than at any time in nearly seven years, and the mood is spreading among smaller companies, a survey by the central bank showed on Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan survey of 10,562 companies showed that the two-year-old recovery, so far driven by strong overseas demand for Japanese cars, electronics and machinery, is seeping into other sectors.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey showed improved confidence among service providers and smaller companies that rely on domestic consumer demand, which has shown signs of resurgence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey was seen as further evidence that this recovery has more staying power than two short-lived upturns in the last decade that were driven initially by exports but dried up when consumers at home failed to spend.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The survey shows the Japanese economy is expanding broadly,'' said Mamoru Yamazaki, chief economist at Barclays Capital (Japan) Ltd. ''I believe the economy will accelerate, particularly in the second half.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey's benchmark subindex of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 companies, rose to plus 12 in March, from plus 7 in December. The latest figure was the highest since June 1997, when the index was plus 13, and was the fourth consecutive increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index for large nonmanufacturers rose to plus 5 in March, from zero in December as retailers, real estate companies and other service providers grew more optimistic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's indexes measure business sentiment by subtracting the percentage of companies that say business conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. Economists say growing optimism in the service sector reflects expectations for more consumer spending, which accounts for about 60 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. Reports of recent pickups in household spending and retail sales are reinforcing that view.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing confidence in Japan's recovery has helped lift the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average 9.4 percent so far this year. The Nikkei closed at 11,683.42 on Thursday, down 0.27 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One caveat economists noted is that the survey was completed before the yen surged against the dollar this week. A rising yen hurts Japanese exporters, like Toyota and Sony, by reducing the value of their dollar-denominated profits when changed into yen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big companies in the survey forecast an average exchange rate of 108.43 yen per dollar for the fiscal year ending March 2005, but the yen has already strengthened beyond that, trading at 103.73 to the dollar on Thursday from as weak as 112 last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the improved sentiment at smaller manufacturers and service providers, companies in those categories remained overwhelmingly pessimistic. The survey's index for small companies improved to minus 3 in March from minus 10 in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists say Japanese companies still face challenges, especially smaller companies that depend on demand at home. While the country's long-deteriorating job market seems to be stabilizing, there are few signs that wages are rising, a necessity for a healthy recovery in consumer demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sustainability of the current recovery is still uncertain,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps reflecting the uncertainty about exchange rates and the strength of consumer demand, large companies surveyed did not see conditions continuing to improve. Large manufacturers forecast their index would hold steady at plus 12 for June, the same level as in March.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's index of financial services, construction, retail and other nonmanufacturing enterprises rose to 65.8 in March from 60.8 the month before, exceeding the previous record of 65.7 in January.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure of services industries, which was higher than all 54 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, builds on the government report Friday that the economy added 308,000 jobs last month, all of them in nonmanufacturing businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports have some investors contemplating whether the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates and some economists considering whether to raise their projections of growth for the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very strong report -- it's confirmation of the big rise in payrolls we saw on Friday, and it's a sign that consumers are spending,'' said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Conference Board's index of business confidence rose to 73 in the first quarter, from 66 in last year's final three months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading was the highest since 74 in the last quarter of 1983. Half of the more than 100 chief executives surveyed said they expected to hire more workers this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchasing managers' report showed that its index of prices paid, a measure of costs for purchased materials and services, surged to 65.7 from 57.3 in February. The increase was the biggest since the index began in August 1997. Sixteen out of 17 industry groups reported increased costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prices-paid component may start to ring some inflation alarm bells, which is a theme that's going to gather momentum as we go along this year,'' Mr. Low said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn., said, ''The vigor of the economic recovery extends beyond the manufacturing sector.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The stage has been set for a re-acceleration'' in the second quarter, he said, to an annual growth rate of about 5.5 percent from about 4 percent at an annual pace from January through March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's employment index rose to 53.9 from 52.7, the sixth consecutive month of growth. The group's March manufacturing survey, released on Thursday, showed the highest employment index since December 1987.  </p>

The center expressed disappointment about the June outcome. ''While it is good news that the downward trend in the economic sentiment has stopped for the present, hopes of a marked pickup have not been fulfilled, though some fundamental data point to an economic recovery,'' the center said in a statement.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, July 1 -- Business is better than at any time since the collapse of the bubble economy a dozen years ago, according to a survey of Japanese companies released Thursday by the central bank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprisingly strong results of the Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan survey of some 10,000 companies showed that the two-year economic recovery remains on track. A wide range of businesses -- from conglomerates to restaurants -- said they were optimistic about their prospects, which reinforces the view that recovery has spread beyond exports, the main driver of growth so far.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Tankan suggests that this indeed is the strongest recovery in the post-bubble era,'' said Ryo Hino, an economist at J.P. Morgan Securities Asia. ''It confirms that business conditions continue to improve and that the improvement is widespread.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey's benchmark index of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 companies, rose to plus 22 in June, from plus 12 in March. The index measures sentiment by subtracting the percentage of companies that say conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. A positive score means optimists outnumber pessimists. The latest figure was the highest since August 1991, and was the fifth consecutive increase.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most optimistic companies were steel makers, which have experienced growth thanks to strong demand from Chinese factories.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index for large nonmanufacturers rose to plus 9 in June, from plus 5 in March, and was the best score since February 1992, as restaurants and transportation companies grew more optimistic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing confidence among smaller companies and service providers, which depend closely on domestic demand, was seen as especially encouraging because it suggests a recovery in consumption in Japan. That element was missing from two earlier recoveries that fizzled out in the last decade as initial bursts of export growth faded.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also showed that companies planned to invest more. Big businesses said that they planned to increase investment an average of 5.7 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2005, compared with an average 0.6 percent cut in investment that they planned just three months ago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rosy survey results follow a period of robust expansion for Japan. The economy grew at an annual 6.1 percent in the first quarter after expanding 7.3 percent in the last quarter of 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the solid numbers, some economists still harbor doubts about how much longer Japan's growth spurt will last. Growth for the economy as a whole still depends to a great extent on exports to China and the United States, leaving Japan vulnerable to a slowdown in the United States and to attempts by Chinese central bankers to slow that country's expansion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in the yen against the dollar could also take some of the steam out of the recovery as a stronger Japanese currency would make exports less profitable.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, there are few signs that ordinary Japanese consumers share the optimism of the country's businesses. The job market has been slowly improving but unemployment among the young remains high. And though Japanese corporations have become much more profitable in recent years, many of the gains have come at the expense of ordinary workers who have seen their wages fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Thursday's survey presented a mixed outlook for the months ahead. Large manufacturers expect business conditions to deteriorate slightly in the next three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Firms are expecting a higher yen, which is one of the risk factors for the economy,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo. ''We expect some adjustment phase for the Japanese economic recovery early next year.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Killingsworth thought he had discovered a promising product to supplement the earnings from his struggling sign-painting business -- award plaques made from sandblasted alder wood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Killingsworth created the plaques in his sign shop near Pearland, Tex. People who saw them raved about the sand carving and laser work that included designs like the silhouette of a state or a golfer, and he started selling them to nearby trophy shops.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like a lot of entrepreneurs, he lacked the resources and expertise to market to a wider audience. Then, in short order, he received help from an initiative started last year by the Small Business Administration to give entrepreneurs access to contacts that would normally be out of reach. Called Business Matchmaking, the program invites small-business owners to meet with representatives of big corporations and government agencies at events the S.B.A. organizes around the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, a friend mentioned to Mr. Killingsworth that one such event was taking place in Houston. He had never heard of the program, but he sensed opportunity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After scrambling to line up four appointments with prospective clients who would be attending, he tossed several plaques into his Chevy pickup and drove the 20 minutes to the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, the site of the event. He had heard that he should dress up, so he bought a new pair of shoes and a sports coat to wear over his golf shirt, ''so I looked like a used car salesman,'' he recalled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever impression his attire made, he received instant business gratification. The S.B.A. cautions participants not to expect a signed contract immediately, telling them that the interviews are mostly get-acquainted sessions. But unlike service companies, his REK Products Inc. had a product to show, and he was able to line up a $5,000 contract the first day. No sooner had he signed it, he said, than he bumped into Hector V. Barreto Jr., the S.B.A. director, who was making the rounds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He cautioned me not to expect a contract immediately,'' Mr. Killingsworth said with a chuckle. ''Then I told him that I just wrote up an order.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was fine with the S.B.A. chief, who has high hopes for the program. ''We're taking procurement out of the Beltway and bringing it to Main Street,'' Mr. Barreto said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hewlett-Packard Company helps pay for the events, which have been held in 10 cities so far, including Anaheim, Calif.; Birmingham, Ala.; Chicago; Houston and Orlando, Fla., with another scheduled next month in Philadelphia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orlando, 500 small-business owners made pitches to 130 buyers. Over all, nearly 5,000 small businesses have attended the conferences and have held close to 19,000 meetings with prospective buyers. S.B.A. officials say they can track only contracts that are awarded on the spot, which have totaled about $17 million, but they think the value of all deals is far higher because multiple meetings are usually required before contracts are signed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto wants to make the matchmaking program permanent, and the agency is looking for ways to finance it when it expires at the end of the year. ''We love this program,'' an S.B.A. spokesman, Seth Becker, said. ''We are going to do whatever we can to keep it going.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is that it gives entrepreneurs a shot at business that they otherwise might not even know about. The Small Business Act requires that about 23 percent of government contracts for goods and services go to small businesses. In June, the S.B.A. reported that a record $65.5 billion, or 23.6 percent, went to small ventures in fiscal 2003, up from $53 billion in 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, many small businesses complain of the difficulties of landing deals with federal agencies. Part of the problem is that many contracts bundle a broad range of goods and services that only big suppliers can provide. Another, said Mr. Barreto, who was an entrepreneur in California before assuming the agency's leadership, is the difficulty most small companies have in getting the ear of Washington bureaucrats. It is that gap that he is trying to address with the matchmaking project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our job is to empower 25 million businesses across the country,'' Mr. Barreto said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A worthy goal, but opinions on the agency's efforts still vary widely. ''They appear to be opening doors for small contractors, and I want to help the agency build on this progress,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who is chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics, who pounced on the S.B.A. earlier this year for the temporary shutdown of a popular loan program, and who more generally complain about what they see as its excessive bureaucracy, are not so sure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, the New York Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, for example, wonders if the program is nothing more than a glorified trade show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some $1.7 million in funding has been diverted from S.B.A. programs that are specifically aimed at helping low-income and minority businesses to fund the initiative,'' she said. The S.B.A. claims the true figure is $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Velazquez said the S.B.A. had not provided hard data on whether the initiative was actually working, and whether this money was increasing contract opportunities for small businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It works for some. Marcus Mosley made a spur-of-the-moment 20-minute drive from his family's business in Gary, Ind. -- Champs Doors and Windows -- to a matchmaking session in Chicago last June and won a $200,000 deal to replace doors at local Navy installations. And Donnie McDaniel, head of Best Products in Arlington, Tex., signed a contract at the Houston session with a Halliburton division for $90,000 in construction items for Iraq.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the program, Mr. McDaniel said, he would never have gotten a foot in the door. ''To do business with a Lockheed Martin or a Raytheon or any large government prime, it almost takes an act of Congress,'' he said. The chance for one-on-one meetings with vendors for big corporations and government agencies, albeit usually for just the 15 minutes that are generally allotted, he said, ''is an opportunity we won't pass up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Sturdivant, who gives out information about contracts for the Department of Homeland Security, said the matchmaking sessions ''help contractors learn their homework.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We tell them what contracts are coming up,'' Mr. Sturdivant said, ''what the process is, and help facilitate the relationship -- it works for everybody.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto imported the matchmaking idea from Los Angeles, where he led the Latin Business Association, California's largest Hispanic business organization. Using the same model of bringing together corporations and government agencies with small businesses, association members landed about $15 million in contracts in 1999. Last year, that number grew to $100 million, all in the Los Angeles area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determined to use that experience to take the mystery out of the procurement process, Mr. Barreto decided to train and counsel small companies so they were able to present their products and services so the big agencies and companies had a thorough understanding of what they had to offer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that work is done online, at  www.businessmatchmaking.com[http://www.businessmatchmaking.com], where companies can register their information. Aided by a group of retired executives, the S.B.A. estimates that it trained and counseled about 2.1 million businesses last year, and about 40 percent of them were handled online.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During business-matchmaking events, Hewlett-Packard sponsors a cybercafe where entrepreneurs can stop between appointments for information and advice from lending institutions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Killingsworth, who signed two contracts at the Houston event, declined to give details on how his award-plaque business was doing, except to say that ''we are running ahead of last year because we are doing more retail, which means we are selling directly and getting a better price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best thing about the experience, he says, is not the money; it is the self-confidence he has gained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had a lot of people looking at the product,'' he said, ''and saying that it looked great, so I learned a lot about selling it.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 11 -- With its protests and political tumult of the last few years, Venezuela has been anything but hospitable to business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at sprawling car plants in the city of Valencia, southwest of Caracas, production this year is up sharply. Eli Lilly &amp; Company, maker of impotence drugs, Prozac and insulin, is expecting sales to shoot up. The DirectTV Group says the number of subscribers should increase 18 percent this year, to 320,000.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Juan Vicente Alvarez, whose family has had a construction company for 34 years, is planning a string of apartment complexes that are its largest projects since 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is all part of an economic rebound that, economists say, could lead to growth rates of 10 to 12 percent this year, nearly double the government's initial forecasts. The rise in Venezuela's economy, Latin America's fourth largest, is helping to drive what the United Nations says will be a 4 percent expansion in Latin America this year, the biggest since 1997.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Venezuela's left-leaning government, which has been fending off threats to remain in power, the economy's rebound could not have come a moment too soon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Facing a recall referendum on Sunday that could end President Hugo Chavez's turbulent five years in office, the economic boom -- driven by soaring oil prices that have left Venezuela awash in petro-dollars -- is spurring heavy government spending on social programs that are having the desired effect: solidifying support when the president needs it most.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the government celebrates, Venezuela's economy is anything but healthy, after a two-year contraction that some economists call one of the biggest free falls in Latin America in years. In 2002, the economy fell 8.9 percent, and crumpled again in 2003, by 9.4 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crippled by antigovernment strikes in 2002 that went into 2003, production at Venezuela's large government-owned oil company at one point slowed to a trickle. Companies went out of business, and many people lost their jobs, floating into the country's mushrooming informal economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only one way to go -- up -- the economy has registered startling growth this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a statistical bounce since it was going to come back,'' explained Rafael de la Fuente, chief Latin economist for BNP Paribas in New York. ''Still, you're not back at the level you were two years ago. All told, this is still an economy that hasn't recovered.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driven by world oil prices that are approaching $45 a barrel, oil revenues have risen 120 percent in last 12 months, and nonoil revenue has nearly doubled, LatinSource, a network of economists based in New York, said in a recent report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic indicators, though, gloss over an economy unable to attract much foreign investment or create jobs for the 50 percent of Venezuelan laborers who toil in the informal sector, selling on the street or running unregulated businesses. Hamstrung by stringent exchange controls and an unpredictable political situation, many local businesses have been unable to grow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly what you're seeing is a normalization of activity at quite a low level,'' said Michael Gavin, chief economist for UBS in Stamford, Conn. ''They recovered from the heart attack, but the cancer is there.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, economic indicators show that Venezuela attracted only $1.4 billion in foreign direct investment in 2003, down from $4.3 billion in 1998, according to Mr. Gavin's calculations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central government is also running deficits as spending rises to $26.9 billion this year from $24.3 billion last year, according to estimates by Credit Suisse First Boston. The budget deficit is expected to be about 5.9 percent of gross domestic product this year, First Boston said, and rise to 6.7 percent next year. The gap was less than 2 percent of gross domestic product in 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current fiscal stance is unsustainable,'' said the bank in a report on Aug. 6, explaining that although high oil prices have permitted more spending, the government will be hit hard when prices drop. The report, written after a visit to Venezuela, said that First Boston researchers ''saw nothing during our visit to change our broadly negative long-term view of Venezuela.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chavez government dismisses such assessments, saying that its social spending generates jobs and that the country's fiscal condition is healthy. Venezuela is, indeed, well regarded for paying its debts on time, and its international reserves have shot up to nearly $24 billion, from $15 billion in 1998.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a government that shows it can come back,'' said Ricardo Dorado, vice minister of labor, explaining that much of the country's free fall was brought about by opposition groups. ''There is now a recovery.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a comeback can be found in sectors like auto production, retail sales and, little by little, construction, which is taking its first baby steps after lean years when building practically reached a standstill.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ford Motor Company in Valencia said that about 140 cars and trucks were being built each day -- about 50 percent more than last year -- by 1,600 workers, 450 more than last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the automobile industry in this land of big cars and cheap gas may build 120,000 cars and trucks this year, twice the number of 2003. It falls far short of the 217,000 vehicles made in 2001, but executives say they are pleased nevertheless.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For Ford, this has been an excellent year,'' said Enmanuel Cassingena, president of Ford Andina, which also oversees production in Colombia and Ecuador. With its new compact cars, Ford has a 21.7 percent market share in Venezuela, 5.6 percent more than at this point last year, Mr. Cassingena said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sector has rebounded faster than we had thought,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Caracas, other sectors that have registered upticks include construction, up 19.5 percent in the first quarter; retailing, up 27.9 percent, and transport and storage, which grew 25.3 percent. Manufacturing over all, including car production, increased 50 percent in the first three months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Botti, who represents retailers and runs several businesses, said his 47-year-old family-run company, a hardware wholesaler called Padlock, has expanded into several business lines. He provides high-technology hardware to the telecommunications industry and is opening a big food wholesaler.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has flourished,'' Mr. Botti said of his business. ''We are being reborn.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But under the rosy surface, he explained, is an ailing economy. Some big competitors have gone out of business, a trend seen across the country and leading to a concentration of companies. And he notes that the encouraging economic data this year hide the fact that the growth rates are being compared with the period last year, when the economy was paralyzed and near collapse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have is a debacle -- we have more people and a smaller economy,'' he said. ''The government holds it all up as a success, but what you see is lost business and a lack of competitors.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction, considered a barometer of the economy, is also in a delicate position. Companies are building schools in the government's drive to bolster education. A metro system, is being built in Los Teques, outside Caracas, and in the capital the subway is being expanded. Some big projects, like a bridge over the Orinoco River and a major highway, are also moving forward.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alvarez, the builder whose company was started in 1970, is embarking on an upscale complex of 300 apartments, called Sun Views, in Caracas and a project of 700 more units in Valencia. But Mr. Alvarez, who also represents realtors, says that is a tepid start.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, only 9,000 apartment units and houses were built, down from 92,000 in 1997, according to the leading builders' association in Caracas. In all, construction in 2003 accounted for a third of the economic activity it generated in 2001. The industry has 550,000 workers, down from 1.1 million during the 1970's construction boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the economy reviving, Mr. Alvarez is somewhat optimistic that his and other companies will soon see better days. But he says there are hurdles of all kinds, from more cautious buyers to a lack of credit to political uncertainty.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are projects that are ready to get off the ground,'' he said. ''But, of course, the purchasing power of people is not where it should be.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TERRY MAXWELL, 60, started Ergonomic Products Inc. in 1993 when few people had heard of ergonomics. The company, in Mesa, Ariz., makes computer accessories like armrests. Though his sales, mostly to corporations like Motorola and the Bank of America, have fallen with competition from big office products catalogs, Maxwell still sells about $100,000 of his goods a year.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is mainly details and follow-up. As a small-business person, you want that repeat business, so after I have shipped the product to the client, I call and make sure it arrived on time, and that it was not damaged and they are satisfied; you know, is the color correct? If not, then I can correct it immediately.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And big business should not forget small business. There are good products out there from small businesses. I can get the same products and sell them cheaper than what they are buying them for. But everybody is streamlining, trying to go from 50 vendors to 4, which I suppose makes sense with less paperwork, fewer people, but when you do business with a smaller company, well, say you call the big vendor for a product and they tell you it will take four to six weeks. But if they called me, because I've worked with my supplier for so long, I can go to him and say: 'Hey, Joe, I've got a special order. Put me in front of the line,' and I would have them in 10 days.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAMELA MOORE, 41, invented Ice Tubes, tube-shaped molds that produce rods of ice that fit into beverage bottles and keep drinks cold. Ms. Moore incorporated Ice Tubes in Tallmadge, Ohio, in 1998, and shipped her first molds to retail stores in 1999. She was among five winners of an award celebrating women in business at the 2004 Small Business Administration Expo. She said her company was recently valued at $5 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am just now getting to the point where I believe it's time to put together a board of directors. I am in the middle of selling to big business, so I need access to resources to deal with that other world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What frustrates me, without a doubt, is that everything is so complicated. Just to get a purchase order is one example. One company says it can't give me a purchase order until I have the actual inventory ready to ship. But that's a Catch-22, because we have to create that inventory without any commitment that they'll buy it. We committed $75,000 for supplies toward filling the order, but it is now two months later, and we still do not have a purchase order.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think one reason why we have been successful is that we do not have layers and layers of corporate polish, so people can relate to us. That's what worries me a little about a board of directors. One day, I thought to myself, I hate wearing pantyhose in the summer. Are these people going to come in and tell me I have to wear pantyhose? That's not going to work!''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RALPH RUBIO, 47, a self-described San Diego beach bum, returned from a trip to Mexico in 1983 convinced that San Diegans would snap up the fish tacos that were a specialty of vendors there. Mr. Rubio opened a stand near the beach and grossed $43,000 the first year. Today, there are 152 Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill restaurants. Last year, sales totaled just over $131 million. The company went public in 1999.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At big companies, there is always the risk of not being close to the customer. I am really surprised sometimes how, just because a company is big, they forget that. Especially if it's a service business, like insurance or financial services; very few people bother to pick up the phone and say: 'How are you doing? How did we do last time we provided X?'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first two years were the most difficult because every day I'd put the key in the door and not know what would happen. But there was energy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was kind of cool, an adrenaline rush like dropping into a wave. Some never really get that. If you do not catch it, it will get away from you. You'll become a 65-year-old C.E.O. and look back and say, Was it worth it? Business, business, seven days a week? Missed all those opportunities for the beach, time with family? You have to have balance.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LARRY T. CHALLAIN, 53, bought a tiny coffee roasting company, Batdorf &amp; Bronson in Olympia, Wash., from its founders in 1990. Today the company sells its products by mail order, online and through retail places like coffeehouses. It employs 90 people in Olympia and at a second roastery plant in Atlanta.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt employees were the key to success, so all through the years we made sure raises for the employees came first and to bring them up as we were able to pay more, and then our pay came after that. We do feel it is important to pay everyone properly and that includes ourselves. There's not always a relationship between success and failure at big corporations and what they pay the C.E.O.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JEFFREY JORDAN, 30, used his training as a naval architect to help him design a steerable plastic-runner sled. He formed Reindeer Sleds of Vienna, Va., with two principals, himself and his wife, Cara, and no employees. He has contracted with a manufacturer in Baltimore to make the sleds. Last year, his first, he sold 350. He hopes to sell 2,000 this year, while he works full time as a consultant in the defense industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have worked in big business, at Northrup Grumman. The difference I see is managing growth and longevity. In big business, I see a great distance from the hands-on decision-making that you have in small business. Leaders of big businesses have to show a return on investment. They've got shareholders breathing down their necks for a near-term profit, so it can be harder to see a longer-term side.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somehow, big business has to feel like a parent trying to raise a child, with the same attention and nurturing, so he grows even after you're gone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The U.S.A. is a place, in my opinion, for big-business manufacturing. I did have people suggesting I go overseas. My competitors at last year's toy show accosted me, saying I was never going to make it, I needed to go overseas for lower per-unit costs. Well, maybe equally good sleds could be made in China, but I would not be there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have some real needs as a start-up here in the States. I need to be able to build prototypes, handle R. and D., create new products, and I have to have that at my fingertips. So I need a local industrial base. I think big businesses do too.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANDY GOLDFINE, 51, is the founder and president of Aerostich, a company in Duluth, Minn., that produces accessories and protective garments for motorcyclists. Mr. Goldfine started the company in 1983 after inheriting some industrial sewing machines. Today he employs 100 people. Gross sales, mainly through the company's RiderWearhouse catalog and online, totaled $6 million last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was raised all my life in a small town in northern Minnesota with liberal, Nordic traditions, and that is hard to reconcile with the tyranny of accountancy and corporate personhood.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Employers want minimal investment per person. It takes a week to learn repetitive factory assembly. But our products are made start to finish by one person. It takes six months to learn. But their lives are better and they are better at self-management. I was in a sewing factory in Asia once that used bells for break time and shifts. When the end-of-afternoon shift bell rang, and it was time for people to leave, instead of walking out normally, socially, some people ran to get out of there. This is animal husbandry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I began the business not looking for a brass ring outcome or a pot of gold. That would be the consequence, not the goal. I put products on the market the way I wanted and that's slower and more of a pain, but I like the way they are finished.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Motorcycles are a social good, and they create episodic transcendence in people and that makes better people. Ethics and business for me are indivisible. You are what you do. How can it not be?''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with so many products on the market, it is hard to know what to buy and what to ignore. ''If someone came to us and wanted to know what type of software they need, the first thing we would recommend is some kind of bookkeeping program,'' said Dennis Gruell, the director of the Connecticut Small Business Development Center at the University of Connecticut in Storrs.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center has counselors to advise entrepreneurs and workshops and training sessions. ''You can't expect to succeed in small business without proper record-keeping,'' Mr. Gruell said. ''With a minimum of effort, an owner can track expenses and generate reports on a monthly basis to tell them how they're doing against their business plan.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond a basic financial program, Mr. Gruell said owners should keep purchases simple. Software to design business cards, brochures and advertising fliers can be helpful, for example, if the product is straightforward. ''An owner should not spend a lot of time learning how to use complicated software instead of finishing a brochure and getting it out on the street,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such financial software includes QUICKBOOKS PRO from Intuit, Microsoft's SMALL BUSINESS MANAGER and MYOB PLUS from MYOB US. These programs handle banking tasks like printing checks and invoices and paying bills; generating expense reports; printing forms and shipping labels; and tracking inventory, sales, employee time and taxes. It is sometimes possible to try the products before you buy them, or at least see a detailed profile online. A visit to findaccountingsoftware.com can also help gauge the type of financial software a start-up needs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guarding against viruses is critical for companies that want to protect their customer, banking and inventory data, and the two biggest programs are McAfee's ACTIVE VIRUSSCAN SMB EDITION and NORTON ANTIVIRUS by Symantec. (And everyone, of course, should back up important computer files on a regular basis.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people who are starting out, there are several products available to help write a business plan, among them BUSINESS PLAN PRO as well as programs at SmallBusinessPoint.com. NoLo, which publishes self-help legal books for consumers and small businesses, offers software to navigate the United States Patent and Trademark Office and complete an incorporation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger companies may want to buy an office suite program, which combines budgeting, word processing, sales, marketing and other features. These products include Microsoft Office Small Business Edition, WordPerfect Office by Corel and Lotus SmartSuite. There are also dozens of products designed for Main Street businesses like restaurants, antiques dealers, medical offices, florists, construction contractors and even diamond sellers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-up owners may want to check the software their computers came with before they buy anything besides an accounting product because most packages include spreadsheets; and word processing programs often have templates for business cards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it is time to set up a Web site, Mr. Gruell advises entrepreneurs to ignore the software that is available. Starting and operating a site is best left to a professional because an owner's time can be used more productively elsewhere, he said. ''Software is a tool to automate tasks. It's not going to run your business for you.'' SHELLY FREIERMAN   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- PRESIDENT BUSH says he loves small business, and small-business owners are overwhelmingly on his side in the election. But entrepreneurs are not yet giving Mr. Bush the one thing he needs the most: a surge in jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly 20 years now, political leaders of all stripes have taken it as gospel truth that small companies are responsible for about two-thirds of all new jobs created in the United States. (Senator John Kerry, who is as enthusiastic a small-business cheerleader as his opponent, outdoes him on this score, crediting the sector with 75 percent of all new jobs.)   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First proclaimed in the mid-80's by David Birch, at the time a consultant and lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the assertion always obscured major distinctions between small companies with limited ambitions and new companies based on novel ideas or technology.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An abundance of evidence suggests that fast-growing young companies -- from up-start retailers to Internet stars like Google -- do indeed account for a very large part of employment growth. There is also evidence, though not definitive, that small companies have shed fewer workers over the last four years than large corporations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in the more select group of fast-growing start-ups, the small-business dynamo is not what it was during the height of the economic boom. Venture capital funding is a small fraction of what it was before the stock market bubble burst in 2000. Information and technology companies have yet to recover from the dot-com bust. And even fast-growing small companies remain extremely cautious in how they add workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Brian Le Gette and Ron L. Wilson II, who co-founded a quirky but booming design company in Baltimore called 180s. Fresh out of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1997, the two built a business on the reinvention of familiar products -- making earmuffs that are light enough to be both hip and effective for athletes; gloves that can be warmed by blowing into a special conduit; sunglasses that adhere to the bridge of a person's nose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as sales approach $50 million this year, Mr. Le Gette is keeping his work force lean. He outsources all manufacturing and distribution, hiring only ''sharpshooters'' with specialized experience in areas like design, finance or marketing. Last year, the company added fewer than 30 people, bringing the total number of employees to 100, and Mr. Le Gette plans to add even fewer people next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We anticipate lower hiring,'' Mr. Le Gette said. ''You get into the $60-million range, and you don't need as many people per million of sales. There's an economy of scale and scope at that level.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does that mean that the small-business job machine is a myth? The issue is important, because political leaders in both parties have tried to justify a wide range of policies by appealing to the needs of small-business owners.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Bush pushed through generous tax breaks that allowed small companies to write off their investment in new equipment. Partly at the behest of small-business lobbying groups, Mr. Bush has pushed hard for eliminating inheritance taxes. The Bush administration has also rolled back Clinton-era regulations on workplace safety, particularly ergonomic rules for people who work at keyboards, and has tried to revise overtime regulations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small companies and big corporations were all shedding jobs from 2001 through most of 2003, and they are still cautious about hiring.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the percentage of people who work at small companies has remained roughly constant over the last decade, which would seem at odds with an economy where small companies account for the vast bulk of new jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Census Bureau, employment at smaller companies actually climbed more slowly than at large corporations between 1990 and 2001, the most recent year for which data is available. The number of people working at companies with 20 to 100 employees climbed to 20.3 million from 17.7 million, about 13 percent over the 11-year period. But the number of people at companies with more than 500 employees climbed to 57 million from 43 million -- an increase of 32 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts say such comparisons miss a key issue: they argue that job creation comes from what Mr. Birch once described as ''gazelle'' companies -- young enterprises with pioneering ideas that quickly grow into big companies. A company like Google, which did not exist 10 years ago, already shows up in government statistics as a large corporation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The key issue isn't the size of the company but its age,'' said Zoltan J. Acs, dean of the University of Baltimore's Merrick School of Business, who has studied the issue closely.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we know for certain is that much of the growth comes from young companies,'' Mr. Acs said. Based on an intensive analysis of job flows in 1996, Mr. Acs found that most of the growth in employment came from new companies or new establishments at existing companies. Over the long-term, Mr. Acs estimated, about half of all new jobs come from fast-growing new companies and the other half comes from expansion at existing companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are differences when looking beyond the simple question of size, which is apparent in a recent study by Cordelia Okolie, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ms. Okolie analyzed data from the spring of 2000, the waning days of the economic boom, in two ways. First, she sorted companies by their size at the start of the quarter, in March. Then, she analyzed the same data but sorted the companies according to what size they were three months later.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first analysis showed that virtually all the job growth seemed to come from companies with fewer than 250 workers. But the second analysis, based on the size of work forces at the end of the quarter, showed that nearly one-third of all additional employment showed up at companies with more than 500 workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, small companies seemed to provide most of the additional jobs. But the real job growth did not come from people with dreams of being small-business owners. It came from people bent on building big companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may not be that the smallest firms create the most jobs per se,'' Ms. Okolie said. ''It may be that the youngest firms create the most jobs. It may be young companies that happen to be innovative and also happen to be small.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a distinction that neither President Bush nor Senator Kerry tend to emphasize. But the distinction is important in terms of another important issue in the campaign, job quality. Overall, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average weekly wages are lower at small establishments -- $627 at companies with 20 to 40 employees in 2003, versus $919 a week at companies with 500 employees and $1,079 a week at companies with 1,000 workers or more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, small businesses have been cutting back on health insurance benefits far more than large corporations. According to the latest study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 63 percent of companies with fewer than 200 employees offered health insurance benefits, compared with 99 percent of larger companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both candidates support special tax breaks for small companies. Mr. Kerry has promised $170 million in new money for loans to small businesses; a new ''jobs tax credit'' for small companies that increase their work forces; elimination of capital gains taxes on investments in small companies; and a bigger share of federal contracts for small companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kerry also contends that his biggest contribution to small business would be his plan to reduce health insurance costs, which have been rising at double-digit rates for several years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plan, estimated to cost at least $682 billion, would have the federal government underwrite much of the cost of catastrophic health insurance, which the Kerry campaign says will reduce the cost of health insurance premiums by about $1,000 a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bush claims to have already increased lending to small business by 50 percent, and he too promises to give small businesses a larger share of federal contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the heart of Mr. Bush's appeal to small business is on tax cuts and deregulation. Because the vast majority of small-business owners are taxed on company profits as individual income, Mr. Bush's reduction of individual income tax rates effectively reduced taxes for millions of small companies. On top of that, his last tax package quadrupled the amount of money that small companies could immediately write off on purchases of new equipment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kerry contends that his health care proposals would greatly reduce one of the most worrying costs to small-business owners and make it easier for them to compete by offering health insurance benefits similar to those of large corporations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners and executives at large corporations alike are far more likely to support Mr. Bush over Mr. Kerry, who they fear would both raise their taxes and increase regulation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Mr. Kerry and the Democrats can point to solid evidence that they would not necessarily be bad for entrepreneurship: new companies had one of their biggest booms ever during the Clinton years.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIMBERLY YORIO, a co-owner of a public relations firm, YC Media, thought she was pretty good at finding the things a small business needed. After all, she and her business partner, Caitlin Friedman, were co-authors of the book, ''The Girl's Guide to Starting Your Own Business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it came to picking a phone system, the choices were overwhelming, Ms. Yorio said, and they ended up getting help from a phone consultant.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They chose a product called TALKSWITCH, made by CENTREPOINT TECHNOLOGIES, which cost $1,700, Ms. Yorio said. It has most of the features she considered essential, like an automatic call log, a good voice-mail system and the ability to forward calls to a home number or a cellphone -- if not the extras they had envisioned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To figure out what you need, as opposed to what you would like, start by describing your business challenges to the vendors or consultants you are considering.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My first line is, 'Tell me about your business and tell me how it works,' '' said Gregg Persky, a vice president of sales for TELE-DYNAMICS, a New York City company that sells telecommunications products from various manufacturers, including AVAYA, 3COM and TOSHIBA. Robert Pullman, chief executive of Tele-Dynamics, said that multiline phone systems from these manufacturers cost about $500 a line, plus $3,000 to $5,000 for a voice-mail system, which includes installation, programming and maintenance. Such systems, also called ''key systems,'' offer conference calling, speed dialing, caller ID and other features. For an ''enterprise system,'' which links offices in multiple locations, the cost is about $900 to $1,000 per line.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option for small businesses is to buy equipment or packages of services through their phone company, which often sells products made by various manufacturers. Phone companies are also offering their own packages of services to small business, with various phone and data options to choose from.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, SBC COMMUNICATIONS offers small businesses an unlimited local and long-distance calling package for $48.95 a month for the first line, and $44.99 a month for each additional line, which includes caller ID, call forwarding and three-way calling. Customers can add other services, like a DSL line, Web hosting or a wireless phone, for additional monthly fees (prices vary depending on the service chosen).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Dimmitt, vice president of business marketing for SBC, said that small businesses typically want to put together their own package from a menu of choices. ''They're not looking for someone to give them a standard package or a standard bundle,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Litchman, a former telecommunications executive who now volunteers with Score, a nonprofit group that provides counseling to small businesses, emphasized the importance of a vendor's service record when deciding whom to work with. ''If something happens, you need to know you can rely on your vendor to fix the problem,'' he said, adding that larger vendors sometimes have more clout with the phone companies when there are widespread service outages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if that all weren't complicated enough, innovative companies are now offering phones that are more than phones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The phone system is really no longer a separate technology from all the other technologies that run your business,'' said Jim Puchbauer, the director of marketing for ALTIGEN COMMUNICATIONS, which makes phone systems that merge computer technologies with traditional phone services. In industry jargon, these technologies are called ''IP telephony,'' or ''voice-over IP.'' (IP stands for Internet Protocol.) Ideally, it means your phone and your computer think as one.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, AltiGen's system offers ''unified messaging,'' which means if a voice-mail message comes into the phone system, it can also send that recording as an audio file to the recipient's e-mail account.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the system is linked to a customer database, Mr. Puchbauer said, ''As a phone call comes in, if the phone system recognizes that customer, we can now connect to the database, grab a file and as the phone on your desk rings, up pops whatever information we have on that customer.''

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small-business owners are an optimistic bunch,'' said Doreen Amano, a vice president at MasterCard, ''even when thing are not looking good currently, they're thinking of ways to rebrand or to start a new business to adjust.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MasterCard survey of 1,145 small-business owners ''and financial decision makers'' found that 33 percent expect a ''substantially better year, and 42 percent expect a ''slightly better'' year for their businesses in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Express survey more pointedly asked 773 small-business owners and managers how they viewed the economy. Only 14 percent thought that the economy would negatively affect their businesses (although the numbers were slightly higher in the Midwest); 44 percent thought that business would grow no matter how the economy fared (with numbers higher in the Northeast) and 30 percent said they believed that the economy would improve and that their businesses would expand along with it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Sobbott, the president of American Express's small-business division, said the negative outlook was the lowest in the two years that the company had conducted the survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In CIT's survey of 448 small businesses, done with Business Week Research Services, 28 percent of respondents ''strongly agreed'' with the statement that they were confident about the future of the economy, while 40 percent said they agreed somewhat with that sentiment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the upbeat mood, the proof, at least in retailing, is in the inventory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Sorensen owns the Penn Cycle Corporation, a chain of six bicycle and fitness stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The company had a ''flat year'' Mr. Sorensen said, largely because of a rainy spring and an unusually cool summer. While Mr. Sorensen is ''optimistic that we couldn't have weather as bad as this year, I'm basing my ordering on having a flat year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although his vendors, high-end bicycle makers like Trek Bicycle and Giant Bicycle, would like him to order at least six months in advance, he tries to order four months before the selling season that begins at the end of March. And if his business is better than expected? He hopes his status as a big client will assure additional deliveries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the notoriously fickle clothing business, store owners are showing signs of optimism, but are similarly placing conservative orders. Steven Roberts, president of the Echo Design Group, which sells scarves, other accessories and home products to both large and small stores, said orders from smaller specialty stores were up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Traditionally, stores buy anywhere from three to six months out, but increasingly, it's harder for retailers to predict that far in advance,'' he said. ''As a result, people tend to be a little more cautious and buy closer to when the consumer is ready to make a purchase.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some of the surveys included a breakdown of industries responding, none correlated levels of optimism with types of business. The toy industry, for example, seems less sanguine about the near future, particularly after the two giants, Mattel and Hasbro, posted disappointing third-quarter results. And those in the novelty market are also not expecting an increase in 2005 sales. Nigel Febland, whose company, the Febland Group in New York, sells seasonal and novelty products with an emphasis on Halloween to both chains and independent stores, finds that ''consumers are coming into the stores and buying later'' and says that retail sales are either ''flat or down.'' He said that he could not predict next year's season until he received his ''sell-throughs'' for this Halloween, although he hoped there would be ''a strong kick at the end.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those who have done well throughout the recent recession are not willing to predict that the future will be as sunny. Leigh Ballen, president of Developers Inc., a real estate firm in Chicago, said: ''I think we've been riding a wave that others haven't had the benefit of. I have a new fear, because I don't know how long people will stay in the market when interest rates go up.'' His company, he said, ''hedges by being in the starter market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residual uncertainty may emanate from the barrage of disparate economic indicators announced of late. A recent survey conducted by the University of Michigan, for example, showed that consumer confidence, buffeted by high gas prices, slow job growth and the war, had dropped slightly in September, although still ahead of last year's levels. Despite those uncertain results, the Department of Commerce, in figures released last Friday, found that retail and food sales were up 7.7 percent from September 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national employment picture, also lackluster, could get a small lift from some small businesses next year. American Express found that 35 percent of respondents plan to hire in the next six months, a drop from the April survey, but above the 26 percent that reported planning to hire in 2002. Similarly, MasterCard found that one-third of the small businesses it surveyed expected to increase staff, while 65 percent expected staffing to remain the same.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sorensen of Penn Cycle, for example, said he planned to keep his staff at about the same level next year. But Gerry Hartung, president of Physician Practice, a medical publishing and education company in Glen Burnie, Md., said his company had been slow to hire and was ''probably overworking our current staff.'' Still, he said, his company had hired 13 people this year and planned to hire four more and even more next year. ''If we don't put people in place,'' he said, we ''won't be able to take advantage of the economy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of small businesses plan on making some capital improvements in the coming year. According to the American Express survey, 61 percent do, virtually unchanged from last year but up slightly from October 2002. The CIT/Business Week survey found that 60 percent planned on investing in technology, but only 22 percent in their facilities or property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is controlled optimism,'' said John Canning, president of the CIT Small Business Lending Corporation. ''Businesses want to invest in the future, but it is not a huge expansionary time.'' Companies that have already experienced an improved market, however, are more likely to make capital investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Bruss, who has run a design firm in Denver since 1990, said: ''A year ago, we were doing estimates, but people would take a long time and have a tendency to revise and retrofit to their needs. Now people are coming to us with clear objectives of what they want to get done'' and want the work done quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, she has increased her staff and is planning to buy a larger building to house her expanding firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I own the place I'm now in, but I am looking at a building that is twice the size, although I would need to lease some of the space,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those involved in leasing retail space have seen some increased activity based on ''pent-up demand for decent areas,'' according to Brian Moss, the vice president of the Shopping Center Realty Corporation in Greenwich, Conn., which handles the leasing and property management of retail space. But expansion, he said, was ''more the exception than the rule.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, those experiencing an uptick in business are willing to invest. Ken Giddon, president of Rothman's, a small men's clothing chain, for example, has just finished renovating his flagship men's shop in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I have put more money into the business in the last year than in any year in the last 15,'' Mr. Giddon said. ''I'm feeling more comfortable than I have in years.'' His company also has stores in Southampton and Scarsdale, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Giddon said the men's apparel business was a ''good barometer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The easiest thing for men to put off is buying clothes, because it's not high on their hierarchy of needs,'' he said. ''When our business goes up, it's a good indicator for the economy. We have had an incredibly strong first eight months this year, although I have seen in the last two months a softening. But I believe that is related to the election.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As just about every entrepreneur with a bright idea knows, it can be a long and painful journey from the time the light bulb goes on to the day the revenue starts rolling in.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And perhaps the most frustrating experience of building a start-up is the never-ending quest for financing. A business owner who hits up family, friends, wealthy investors, banks or venture capitalists is likely to discover that they open their wallets reluctantly and become impatient for results once they do hand over the cash.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for high-technology entrepreneurs, there is another source of financing that can be as generous as it is little known: grants from the federal government's Small Business Innovative Research Program.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest fund, by far, is run by the Defense Department, which parcels out some $1 billion a year to independent companies with fewer than 500 employees. The goal is to stimulate research into novel technologies that can benefit military operations, but with a twist. The department is not paying for exclusivity for the ideas it finances; rather, it wants those ideas to go commercial as quickly as possible to assure a stream of reliable and cost-effective suppliers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Klein is one of its emerging success stories -- at least that is what he hopes. A chemical engineer by training, Mr. Klein has spent 40 years in the battery and fuel-cell business. In 1970, he founded the Energy Research Corporation, since renamed Fuel Cell Energy Inc., and later sold his stake in it. Today, it employs 500 people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in 1992, he founded Electro Energy Inc. to develop batteries for the military, and that same year submitted a proposal for a grant for research into what he calls a rechargeable bipolar nickel-metal-hydride battery. What sets it apart from traditional batteries, Mr. Klein says, is its design, which stacks thin flat wafer cells atop one another to improve the flow of current while taking up less space. His eventual aim, he says, is to produce a battery that is 30 percent smaller and cheaper than conventional batteries yet provides 50 percent more power.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Defense Department, which is always on the prowl for better batteries, particularly for its communications equipment and aircraft, liked his idea. It awarded him $50,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein went to work in the basement of his Brookfield, Conn., home, hiring a part-time technician, putting up four workbenches to create a small laboratory and starting work on creating prototypes. Six months later, he presented his test data to the Defense Department and won $750,000 for a second phase of work. He then moved out of the basement and into an office park and hired two full-time technicians and a secretary.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein, 68, said that small-business innovation funds are ''why we are here today,'' but it is not blind governmental largess that kept him and his firm going. When Congress created the program 20 years ago, it was purposely planned not as a handout, but for directed research that would turn into viable commercial products.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Defense Department says its main criterion for choosing recipients is their determination to become a commercial business, not just a research house. It also selects companies active in areas where there is an ''actual need,'' it says, notably improvements in aircraft, satellites, military hardware, communications systems and logistical systems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's paramount that we have a feel for where they are going,'' said Dean Hudson, program manager for the Army Research Laboratory, one of the Defense Department agencies that reviews research applications from entrepreneurs. ''We evaluate their commercial market potential from the very beginning.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of other government agencies have similar programs, including the National Institutes of Health, which has a $574 million annual budget and is the largest small-business innovation program after the Defense Department's. The Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation and the Departments of Energy, Commerce, Health and Human Services, Education and Agriculture have much smaller programs. Like the Defense Department's programs, they are based on a fixed percentage of their annual outside research budgets and thus the amounts vary year to year. All told, the agencies award about $2 billion annually.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The departments and agencies once sent around ''idea books'' seeking high-tech innovators who could address the biggest needs. Now the information is posted on Web sites. Typically, one in eight bidders wins a Phase 1 contract from the Defense Department, and one in three of those wins the deeper-pocket Phase 2 funding. And entrepreneurs can keep going back for more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what does the Defense Department get out of its investment? It has landed some high-profile products; for example, Savi Technology Inc. of California developed a radio computer tag that could be attached to military cargo containers to track their location and contents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SaviTag took $2.5 million, or three awards, of small-business innovation money before it went into production. The military is using it in Bosnia and other locations. Commercially, the tag is being used in the trucking, rail and shipping industries, bringing in some $20 million annually in revenue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another West Coast company, Silicon Designs Inc., developed the ''accelerometer,'' a sensor that tells a missile to arm itself when it reaches a specified acceleration. For its $1.2 million investment, the Defense Department got a replacement for a mechanical switch used in earlier missile systems that was less reliable and five times as expensive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accelerometer is now being put in American-made Ford and Chrysler automobiles to cause air bags to inflate when a car decelerates abruptly during an accident. This commercial application is earning Silicon Designs some $40 million a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the Defense Department also seeks out people to pursue commercial applications of technology it owns. That is what happened to Peter Amico, president of Airtrax Inc., when the Navy transferred its omnidirectional technology to his company in 1996. With an infusion of $850,000 in innovation research money, the company, based in Hammonton, N.J., invented a wheel that can turn in any direction: forward, laterally, diagonally and rotationally.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Navy will be using Airtrax's forklifts and other lifts to reduce the amount of manpower needed to move objects. Mr. Amico said that Airtrax was now moving ahead to sell its Sidewinder omnidirectional lift trucks commercially to reap some profit from its years of research and development.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Klein's case, the Defense Department ''got a battery that it didn't have that meets its needs,'' a spokeswoman said, ''and when the product is commercialized, it gets the economies of scale of a mass-produced product -- faster, cheaper and better.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a long slog for Mr. Klein and others, who typically, according to the Defense Department, underestimate the time between developing a prototype and mass-producing a product.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein went back to the Defense Department more than a dozen times for money, winding up with $5 million. He also got some grants from the Energy Department and landed some regular government contracts, raising a total of $18 million over the last dozen years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not easy. ''We had to replay the whole song each time we asked for money,'' he said. ''You can't count on anything coming through automatically.'' Going back for multiple grants is not unusual, the Defense Department says, as taking a high-technology product from the idea stage to the market can require 8 to 10 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein's company, based in Danbury, Conn., projects $7 million in sales of test units to the military this year. It is starting a major advertising campaign to open the way for commercial use of its battery, including hybrid electric cars, electric bicycles and scooters and cordless power tools and laptops.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein has rivals -- Panasonic in the electric-car market and Sanyo in the power tool market -- but he is confident about his business's future, he says, ''because we have a better mousetrap.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, his company has a stock market value of $100 million, he said, ''but none of the money has created anything in my pocket.'' Still, he is confident about the future, he said, ''because everyone wants a battery that is smaller, lighter and runs longer.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN his own small way, Mark Whitman is proof that the ''new economy'' did not disappear with the collapse of the technology bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When his father bought a small typesetting firm 34 years ago, the trade still had much of its ancient patina, with employees assembling chunks of text and art and manually pasting them together on a backlit table.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mr. Whitman's former family firm is part of an emerging business model that is driving a turbulent new period of economic change. Typesetters are known as publishing services companies. They do their cutting and pasting on a computer. Instead of working with photographic plates and negatives, they receive documents over the Internet that can be transmitted directly to digital printers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in 1999, Mr. Whitman sold the family firm to a rival, Techbooks, which has moved most of the cutting and pasting to its facilities in India. ''We were very successful for 25 to 30 years,'' said Mr. Whitman, who now works as Techbooks' head of marketing. ''But it was difficult for us to compete with an offshore model.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology-driven dislocation that has transformed Mr. Whitman's business is spreading throughout the economy, many economists say, as more businesses discover how to harness new technological tools and fuel a surge in productivity growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cable is taking audiences from the television networks. Telephone giants are losing business to the Internet. Wal-Mart has forced Toys ''R'' Us to consider exiting the toy business. From the goliaths of industry to the smallest of niche firms, American companies seem to be in the grip of unprecedented industrial upheaval.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've always had a lot of turbulence in technology, but now turbulence is going beyond technology companies,'' said Adrian Slywotzky, a managing director of Mercer Management consulting. ''In the next few years we will see more of that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, technology is changing what a book is. New digital techniques to layer meta-information onto texts have created Internet-based interactive books, a potentially revolutionary breakthrough for fields like high school education.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Internet permits many of these tasks to be done cheaply in faraway places. ''The business model is completely changing,'' said Rakesh Gupta, founder and chairman of Techbooks. The company makes everything from American high school textbooks to specialty journals like Kidney International, with most of the work done in New Delhi.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With annual revenue of $50 million, Techbooks, based in Fairfax, Va., is now one of the larger companies in its market, having bought up several rivals to gain customers. According to Mr. Gupta, it is growing at about 20 percent a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual new economy might not look quite like the utopian arrangement envisaged by the stubbled gurus of the dot-com period-- where everything brilliant was done online by 22-year-olds. But from the global outsourcing of business processes via the Internet to Wal-Mart's sophisticated logistics management systems (which have been crucial in allowing it to drive down prices and achieve its gargantuan scale), information technology is reshaping businesses and markets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The corporate landscape is littered with ailing former giants struggling to come to terms with the new realities. For instance, the big four television networks have lost 16 percent to half of their prime-time viewers to cable channels in the past decade. They could soon lose much of their revenue, too, as new gadgets like digital video recorders (TiVo, for one) allow people to strip commercials out of their favorite shows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year, the camera-film giant Eastman Kodak -- once one of the five biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange -- has been struggling to retool itself to survive in the new filmless digital world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gale of innovation and industrial reorganization is a product of two major forces. The computer and its more recent application, the Internet, are seeping into every nook and cranny of the economy, and are being used by companies across the board for an expanding array of purposes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even as this technological breakthrough has ignited a rush of investment and innovation, deregulation that started some 25 years ago has opened formerly protected sectors like airlines, telephone companies and electric utilities to competition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the effect of these transformations has been a significant lift to productivity, which over the last eight years has grown at an annual rate of over 3 percent, nearly double the pace of the preceding 30 years. Several economists have argued that the productivity burst is a consequence of big investments in information technology since the 1980's, delayed because companies took time to understand and apply the technology they were buying.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say the current industrial turmoil is not unique -- that it just seems more intense because it is affecting high-profile brand-name companies. ''It's been happening for 200 years now,'' said Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures, the current corporate turmoil looks rather run of the mill. Of the 50 largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964, only 6 were still on the list last year. And the churn has been more or less constant over the last 40 years, with 13 to 14 companies dropping out of the top 50 every five years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last half-century is littered with corporate has-beens. The once- mighty RCA was swallowed by General Electric, and Warner-Lambert by Pfizer. Bethlehem Steel ceased to exist this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mokyr pointed to other bouts of technological and industrial transformation of similar relevance over the last century, including the replacement of the rail-based transportation system with roads and the revolution in communications brought about by the telephone, television and satellites.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The technologically induced structural change is probably not worse now than it used to be,'' Mr. Mokyr said. ''It's just happening in different places.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern, argues that the innovations that will flow from information technology from now on will be entertaining --like the Palm Pilot and the iPod-- but hardly revolutionary. ''The Web could only be invented once,'' he wrote in a paper this year. Information technology's fleeting boost to productivity, he argues, is likely to be over.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The footprint left by information technology on the economy is large, however, and it is still growing. Information technology has changed how companies sell everything from books to airline tickets to equities. The increase in computing power is opening up whole new fields of endeavor, like genetic sequencing and biotechnology. Many businesses are just now learning to deploy technology usefully.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most significant for corporate America, the Internet has enabled a new wave of global outsourcing, allowing once nation-bound companies in the service sector -- the biggest part of the American economy-- to dispatch parts of their business to cheap labor markets on the other side of the world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONCERN is arising over the future pace of innovation. Corporate investment in technology collapsed after 2000, and it is doubtful that it can ever again achieve the frantic pace of the 1990's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon pointed out, for instance, that much of the investment surge in the 1990's was driven by factors that are unlikely to be repeated, like the deregulation of telecommunications. He said companies' investment in technology has suffered from diminishing returns.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And paradoxically, the cutthroat environment of ever increasing competition could actually hinder future technological advances.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition has been a spur to innovation, driving companies to find ways to do things better or cheaper, to gain new markets and reap higher profits. But competition can also diminish the incentives to develop new technologies if, as happened with many dot-com initiatives, innovations are easily replicated by rivals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today, with a much more competitive and deregulated environment there are very few companies with the kind of financial cushion to take the 10-to-15-year long-term view,'' said Mr. Slywotzky of Mercer Management. ''Those engines of innovation have shut down.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 -- If the Supreme Court argument Tuesday on interstate wine sales proves to be a reliable roadmap to the eventual decision, consumers who want to order wine directly from out-of-state wineries will soon be able to do so with the court's blessing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The justices appeared notably unmoved by the arguments offered by New York and Michigan in defense of laws that prohibit the direct shipment of wine from other states while permitting in-state wineries to ship their products to their customers' homes.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50 states are divided almost in half on a question that has grown increasingly contentious in the age of Internet advertising and sales. Twenty-six states permit direct shipment from out-of-state wineries; 24 ban it. The federal appeals courts are divided, too; one court upheld New York while another, almost simultaneously, declared Michigan's law unconstitutional.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states' central argument, presented by Solicitor General Thomas L. Casey of Michigan and Solicitor General Caitlin J. Halligan of New York, was that the 21st Amendment gave states such blanket authority over the ''importation'' of alcohol as to trump the constitutional principle that applies everywhere else in the national marketplace: that states cannot discriminate in favor of their own products.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mere protectionism is permitted'' by the amendment that repealed Prohibition, Mr. Casey said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This case goes to the very core of the 21st Amendment,'' Ms. Halligan added in her turn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It also goes to the very core of the Commerce Clause,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy responded. That clause, which empowers Congress to regulate interstate commerce, has been interpreted since early in the country's history to include the implication that states may not, on their own minus Congressional authorization, discriminate against one another.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that in the 21st Amendment he found ''not a word in any brief that I saw of any intent to get rid of the antidiscrimination principle.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor did the justices demonstrate more patience with the fallback, that if the 21st Amendment did not simply obliterate the Commerce Clause, the laws could nonetheless be justified by the twin goals of preventing minors' access to alcohol and ensuring that the states could collect taxes from out-of-state shippers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Sullivan, arguing for the 13 consumers who successfully challenged the Michigan law in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, pointed out that Michigan permits its 40 in-state wineries and 7,500 liquor retailers to make home deliveries. That showed ''a pattern of exceptions that belies any implication'' that the state's real goal was to protect minors, she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sullivan, a professor and former dean at the Stanford Law School, said several states that permit direct shipments from out-of-state wineries tracked the taxes owed by requiring the wineries to obtain permits and report monthly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her points made an impact, and Justice David H. Souter observed to Mr. Casey, Michigan's lawyer: ''Your opponents argue that there are no clear countervailing interests here, so by process of elimination you get down to nothing but protectionism. What's your answer?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law really does enable the state to protect minors, Mr. Casey replied.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You say that, but how?'' Justice Souter persisted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Casey's response that state regulators could punish a state-licensed business left Justice Souter clearly unsatisfied.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two state laws under review in Granholm v. Heald, No. 03-1116, the Michigan case, and Swedenburg v. Kelly, No. 03-1274, the New York case, are not identical. While Michigan flatly prohibits direct shipment by out-of-state wineries, New York theoretically permits it, as long as the winery maintains a physical presence in the state, including a warehouse to store its wines before sale. No out-of-state winery has qualified for this exception, and although the law has been on the books since 1970, the state has not issued the regulations necessary to make the exception operative.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clint Bolick, arguing for the plaintiffs in the New York case -- small wineries in Virginia and California, along with three New York wine drinkers -- said small wineries could not afford to set up offices around the country as the price of reaching customers in other states.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our clients cannot compete with liquor distributors,'' Mr. Bolick said. ''They can compete in the market. The Commerce Clause protects a level playing field.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that of 3,000 wineries in the country, 600 sell their products in New York's retail liquor stores.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bolick is strategic litigation counsel of the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm with libertarian leanings that began a campaign against the state laws several years ago. His lawsuit in New York succeeded in Federal District Court, but that ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which took an expansive view of the 21st Amendment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bolick said the amendment should be understood to permit states to regulate alcohol ''by one set of rules, not two.'' He added that New York was engaged ''not in legitimate regulation, but in economic protectionism.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Supreme Court's own view of the 21st Amendment has shifted over the years from one that was much like the states' position to one that has increasingly taken account of the Commerce Clause. In a 1984 case from Hawaii, Bacchus Imports Ltd. v. Dias, the court invalidated an exemption from a 20 percent excise tax the state gave to its local liquor industry.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is by now clear that the amendment did not entirely remove state regulation of alcoholic beverages from the ambit of the Commerce Clause,'' Justice Byron R. White said in his majority opinion, which concluded: ''We are convinced that Hawaii's discriminatory tax cannot stand.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bacchus case was much discussed during the argument. The three dissenters in that case, Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor, along with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, are still on the court, while no member of the majority is. Nonetheless, there was no indication from Justices Stevens or O'Connor -- Chief Justice Rehnquist was not in court because of his treatment for cancer -- that they did not accept the Bacchus precedent as binding.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you can't grant a tax exemption,'' Justice Stevens said to Ms. Halligan, the New York lawyer, ''it seems to me a fortiori that you can't prohibit importation.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Casey, Michigan's lawyer, said the Bacchus decision was wrongly decided and should be overruled, Justice O'Connor responded: ''It's a little hard to plan on overruling it, so why don't you address how to distinguish it, because it has a lot of language that cuts against you.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the states, the wineries and the wine drinkers, the wholesale liquor industry is acutely interested in the outcome. States regulate alcohol distribution by what is known as a three-tier system: producer to licensed wholesaler to licensed retailer. For the wholesalers, the stakes in this dispute are enormous. If consumers are enabled to buy directly from out-of-state producers, so, theoretically, might retailers be.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Under the same rationale, the in-state licensing system has to fall,'' Justice Kennedy observed at one point.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, Dec. 15 -- Confidence at Japan's largest companies fell in the last quarter from a recent peak, but executives nonetheless said they planned to sharply increase capital investment in the year through March, a central bank survey showed on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business offered some hope that Japan's current slowdown would not turn into a recession. The survey's headline index of confidence among large manufacturers slipped to 22 from a 13-year high of 26 in the previous quarter, as economic growth slowed substantially.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the index was the first since March 2003, but was no surprise after Japan nearly slipped into recession in the third quarter on weakened exports and consumer spending. The economy grew at an annual rate of just 0.2 percent in the third quarter after expanding at a rapid pace of more than 6 percent in the first quarter of the year. The economy shrank at a 0.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures on corporate spending plans were the bright spot in the survey. Large manufacturers plan to increase capital investment 23.4 percent for the year ending March 31, 2005, up from a forecast 20.7 percent increase in the previous survey. If companies follow through on those plans, the increase in capital spending will be the largest in 16 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Japanese economy is weak at this moment, but we can expect an acceleration in capital investment from now so that should prevent the economy from entering into a recession in the near future,'' said Mamoru Yamazaki, chief economist for Barclays Capital in Tokyo. ''Over all, the situation is not so bad.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large manufacturers also raised their sales and profit outlooks compared with the previous quarter. The survey showed that the manufacturers now expect profits to rise 24 percent for the year ending next March compared with the previous year, up 5.1 percentage points from the previous survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A considerable increase in capital spending would be a big help to an economy that has little else going for it right now. Stagnant income growth has kept consumers from spending freely, and the dollar's weakness over the last several months poses risks to the country's all-important export sector. A decline in the dollar against the yen reduces the revenue Japanese companies earn overseas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large manufacturers surveyed in the report said they expected the confidence index to sink to 15 for the quarter ending in March, suggesting they see business conditions worsening.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is often the case, smaller companies and service providers continued to be less optimistic than large manufacturers, though neither group showed a deterioration in their outlooks. The index for large service companies was unchanged from three months earlier at 11, while the confidence score among small manufacturers was unchanged at 5.  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the fall of 1999, Scott Hamilton and his brother-in-law Jonathan Dole were on the verge of signing up their first client for their start-up, Dynarand, a company in San Francisco that manages clinical trials for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions. But they realized they would have to move the business out of the garage at Dr. Hamilton's home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers-in-law knew that before a client handed over the management of clinical studies, a site audit was standard operating procedure. That meant they could lose the job if the client wanted to visit their company, whose software and voice-recognition system ensures that patients at clinics get the proper drug or placebo to maintain the double-blind, randomized studies needed to gain approval by the Food and Drug Administration. In double-blind studies, the drugs being tested are coded so that neither the doctors nor the patients know what they are getting.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They got the job and were ready to rent a cheap office, but the client, Genentech, a biotech company in South San Francisco, decided it didn't need to audit Dynarand right away because Dr. Hamilton had previously worked there as a biostatistician.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Dr. Hamilton and Mr. Dole got the message. It was time to start looking like a real business, and not just when clients visited their Internet site. ''We looked good on the Web, but the vision in their minds was better than reality,'' Dr. Hamilton said. ''The less they knew about us the better.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their company could not have been more virtual. It was hard to ignore the fact that Dynarand was really just two guys in a garage with a half-dozen computers, five phone lines, an old floor lamp and a light bulb hanging over heads full of expertise and new ideas. Dr. Hamilton had worked in the biotech industry, and Mr. Dole had experience at a telecom using interactive voice recognition and database software. While big pharmaceutical companies could afford to manage and design their own trials, the brothers-in-law saw an opportunity to provide the service to smaller companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time that the brothers-in-law landed the Genentech contract, they got another client, Family Health International, a nonprofit organization in Research Triangle Park, N.C., which found Dynarand on the Web. Family Health decided that Dynarand's new automated system was well suited for two new contraceptive studies the organization was about to embark on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about $3,000 a month in guaranteed income from those two contracts, Dr. Hamilton and Mr. Dole rented a bare-bones office in South San Francisco. ''People could actually visit us,'' Dr. Hamilton said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the business itself wasn't really any different. It was still two guys and some computers and phone lines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it was difficult to convince clients that Dynarand was legitimate. One time, when Dr. Hamilton and Mr. Dole were on a sales trip, pitching Dynarand's services to a well-heeled biotech company, the prospective client asked, ''You mean the whole company is right here, right now?'' ''We were a little small for them,'' Mr. Dole said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hamilton added with a rueful chuckle, ''They could have been a good client.'' Since then, Dynarand's business has grown. Its automated system is now used by 50 companies, ranging from small start-ups to pharmaceutical companies with 500 employees. Dynarand, which generated $9.5 million in revenue last year, has 38 employees working in a hive of birch cubicles in a high-tech office in downtown San Francisco overlooking the bay, with the requisite foosball game in the mailroom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth has been almost entirely financed from revenue. The company had no outside investors; in the early years it took a loan from Dr. Hamilton's father, which was promptly paid back. A couple of credit cards and an Internet credit line were used to balance cash flow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the business is almost completely virtual. The employees are involved in making sure that the bank of computers in the locked-down back offices do their jobs. Dynarand never handles drugs or interacts with patients; it acts as an electronic middleman between the companies that develop new drugs or medical devices and the clinics and hospitals where they are tested. ''It's pretty simple, in theory,'' Mr. Dole said. But it can quickly get complicated, he added. ''There is a lot of logic to put into the software.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a patient comes into a clinic to participate in a trial, a doctor or nurse calls Dynarand and is hooked into the automated system. The system responds to voice commands and numbers entered on a telephone keypad to look up the database for the study and determine whether the patient should get a placebo or the drug and at what dose.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system also tracks the supplies of drugs or devices on hand at each of the clinics participating in the study, and it sends a message to the company when more supplies are needed. This helps cut down on inventory at each clinic, thereby reducing waste by not having to store what is not needed. And that is the central proposition of Dynarand's sales pitch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real value is just-in-time inventory,'' Dr. Hamilton said. ''You can keep a lot less drug on site.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hamilton, 44, and Mr. Dole, 33, still have the enthusiasm evident in the photograph album they keep in the office showing Dynarand's origins. Even as the pictures show the company parties swelling and the offices getting bigger, they have remained the sole proprietors of this family business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hamilton is married to Mr. Dole's sister, Sharon. The brothers-in-law met at Dr. Hamilton's wedding, which was held on the East Coast. They still see a lot of each other outside of work, but the business has always been their separate virtual world, even when it was in the garage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were times I would come and go in the garage and never say 'Hi' to my sister,'' Mr. Dole said. When they are with family, he added, ''We don't talk about business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And we don't talk about family at work,'' Dr. Hamilton said.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of the 1990's, thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs have moved away from unemployment or welfare by borrowing a few thousand dollars -- even as little as $500 -- to set up their own small business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Holloway, a single mother and out-of-work pastry chef, used a $5,000 loan from a local women's economic agency in Silver City, N.M., several years ago to cobble together a restaurant in an old storefront, cooking for customers with a scavenged pizza oven and serving them on a half-dozen mismatched tables.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That money made the difference,'' said Mrs. Holloway, whose restaurant, Diane's, is now thriving, with 30 employees. She plans to open two more restaurants next year. ''Without it, I wouldn't have had a chance to get my business going.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the modest financial backing that Mrs. Holloway and other women and minorities have used to create jobs for themselves and others may soon be shut off. The Bush administration has proposed ending the funding for the Small Business Administration's microloan program, which provides seed money and technical assistance to start-ups and low-income entrepreneurs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners like Mrs. Holloway were wooed in the recent election by both parties, which hailed them as driving the American economy by creating millions of jobs across the country. But now that budget time is here, a political debate is boiling over administration proposals to scale back small-business programs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the S.B.A.'s signature loan programs are in trouble, according to some members of Congress who support them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One, the microloan program, is targeted for elimination. It lent almost $33 million to 2,400 entrepreneurs in fiscal 2004, and is one of 10 agency programs set for termination in the budget proposed by President Bush for 2006. Supporters argue that a microloan is almost always the essential first step to success for women and minorities, who usually do not have the money, credit history or collateral to borrow from a commercial bank.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other, the S.B.A.'s giant 7 (a) guaranteed loan program, is in turmoil. While it is not expected to be cut back, it has been operating on fees generated by its loans after running out of money in 2004. Supporters fear it may eventually be slated for elimination, following the pattern of another loan program, intended to help high-technology companies, that the administration now proposes ending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guaranteed loan program backed $12.7 billion in loans in fiscal 2004 to nearly 75,000 businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defenders of the administration's proposed cutbacks, including the agency's administrator, Hector V. Barreto, say that, in reality, money for small businesses will be little affected, and the government will save by not having to pay for the technical assistance that the law requires for loan recipients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little chance that Congress, which has resisted previous administration efforts to prune the agency's budget heavily, will approve the proposed Bush administration cutbacks wholesale. Some influential Republicans are opposed, including Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Still, advocates of the program say the proposals are a serious threat to a program that has an exemplary record of success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women have received the greatest share of microloans, where the S.B.A. furnishes seed capital for lending by intermediaries, usually local nonprofit groups. According to Congressional data for fiscal 2004, more than 60 percent of such loans went to women, and the program had a default rate of just over 1 percent. The government also spent $15 million on technical assistance.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teri Wade, who used a $5,000 microloan to open a salon in Herndon, Va., offering cellulite-reduction treatments, said that the hands-on assistance she received was crucial to her start-up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would have made major mistakes,'' she said, ''like not getting liability insurance, or giving away too much of my business to get financing. Without that advice, I wouldn't be in business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. maintains that microloans, which average $13,600, can be folded into its guaranteed loan program, where the average loan is $15,300. The agency said that around one-third of guaranteed loans were under $35,000, indicating that they were borrowings by start-up firms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The members of Congress said that recent changes in the way the guaranteed loan program was run, especially higher fees for borrowers and lenders, have already crimped the ability of small businesses to get loans. Moreover, they say, the fees and paperwork make smaller loans uneconomical for many banks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, the S.B.A.'s guaranteed loan program was shifted to fee-only, meaning the program receives its support from fees charged to borrowers and banks, and does not have yearly Congressional appropriations to make up any financial shortfall. As a result, the fees have risen, to as much as double on some loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The borrower's costs are now double for the smaller loans of up to $150,000,'' said Richard Proudfit, chief executive of the Gateway Business Bank, a small bank in Cerritos, Calif., that lends to small businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barreto, the S.B.A. administrator, said higher fees had not curbed credit, citing statistics that S.B.A.-backed lending rose 11 percent in the last quarter of 2004 from a year earlier, to $4.4 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Representative Nydia Velazquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, argued that higher fees were pushing lenders out of the picture. For example, she said that in 2001, more than 5,000 banks made S.B.A.-backed loans; three years later, only half as many banks did so. And she contested Mr. Barreto's claim of increased S.B.A. lending, saying that the agency's lending declined by about 10 percent in the last quarter of 2004, to $3.56 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The members of Congress say that confidence in the agency's guaranteed loan program has been undermined, citing the disruption caused when the program ran out of money in early 2004 and was shut down for two weeks until an emergency appropriation was made. Then last April, the maximum amount of money businesses could borrow was lowered temporarily to $750,000, from $1.5 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was damaging to some ventures. Marilyn Landis, a consultant for small businesses, said that lack of funding sank the effort of an established Pittsburgh trucking company to expand by buying a 40-truck fleet from a retiring owner.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospective buyer could not meet the $1.5 million asking price and the owner, who was in her 80's, did not want to carry a second loan. ''In the end, she sold the entire fleet of dump trucks and laid off all 30 employees,'' said Ms. Landis, of Basic Business Concepts in Pittsburgh. ''No one would finance this without S.B.A. backing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a new business, it can be difficult to obtain even an S.B.A.-backed loan, small-business owners and bankers agree.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's fine and dandy,'' said Ms. Wade, the Virginia salon owner, ''to be talking about 7(a) loans, but those are not for start-ups, they are for established businesses.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Mexico, Mrs. Holloway noted that it was not until she had been in business for 18 months that she was able to get a $30,000 S.B.A.-backed loan for her restaurant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a tiny percentage -- 5.7 percent -- of guaranteed loans go to rural small businesses, which is one reason Senator Snowe opposes terminating the microloan program. Fully 40 percent of microloans currently go to micro enterprises in rural areas, so her constituents in Maine would suffer if the program were shut down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has also criticized a proposed $85 million reduction, to $593 million, in the S.B.A.'s overall budget for fiscal 2006. Among the cutbacks she is fighting is the proposed termination of the agency's Small Business Investment Company participating securities program, which encourages venture capitalists to invest in high-technology companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her counterpart in the House, Representative Donald A. Manzullo of Illinois, a Republican who leads the Small Business Committee, also has resisted administration plans to terminate the decade-old program, which, in fiscal 2004, backed more than 2,100 equity investments in small businesses by venture capitalists, totaling more than $1.4 billion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Carter, a spokesman for the House committee, said, ''This program has had some hard times, but we feel we can salvage it to help small manufacturers.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Velazquez said that minority-owned ventures would be hurt most because they received, in 2004, only 11 percent of the investment company money, totaling $148 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she predicted that the proposed cutbacks would not win approval easily in Congress, ''because no one wants to be on the record as opposing small business.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO, April 1 -- Japanese corporate leaders are much less optimistic about business prospects than they were three months ago as they worry about fading export growth, a widely followed Bank of Japan survey showed Friday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprisingly sharp deterioration in the central bank's quarterly Tankan report of business sentiment suggests that it is taking longer than expected for Japan, the world's second-largest economy, to emerge from a slowdown that began last year.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found that while a majority of executives were still optimistic about Japan's economy, the number of optimists was falling fast amid worries about rising commodity prices and prospects for the country's all-important exporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important index in the survey, which measures economic sentiment among large manufacturers, sank to 14 from 22 three months ago. The index score was much lower than the reading of 23 that economists forecast and the lowest level since a score of 12 a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index score is calculated by subtracting the number of executives who say business conditions are deteriorating from those who say conditions are improving. A positive score means a majority of respondents are upbeat about their businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the large decline was a surprise to many economists who have been expecting the economic environment to improve this year after a soft patch that began a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's surprising that the survey has slipped so much when it appears from a lot of the other monthly data that things are actually starting to improve again,'' said Richard Jerram, an economist at Macquarie Securities. ''These numbers are surprisingly conservative; in fact, they are worse than conservative.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing export growth weighed on the survey result, economists said. Exports from Japan increased by 1.7 percent in February from a year earlier, the smallest increase in more than a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports of autos, machinery and electronic gadgets are crucial to the Japanese economy because they have been the only consistent source of growth over the last several years. A prolonged slowdown in exports now would drag on the economy, particularly because there are few signs of a pickup in consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of Japan's economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The basic problem is that the main driver of growth is still exports, and we just sort of have to wait and see how exports come in,'' said Peter Morgan, an economist at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. ''We need to see some pickup in exports to get the overall expansion going again.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the central bank's survey of 10,344 companies, which was conducted in late February and March, respondents said they did not expect business conditions to change much over the next three months. Executives forecast the large-manufacturer's index would be unchanged at 14 next quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak survey result was the latest in a string of disappointing economic figures. This week, the government reported that industrial production sank 2.1 percent in February from the month before as demand for electronic machinery weakened. Japan's unemployment rate unexpectedly crept up to 4.7 percent in February from 4.5 percent in March and consumer spending slowed more than anticipated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recent lackluster numbers have not changed the view, shared by most economists, that the pace of growth will pick up in the first quarter of this year from the annual rate of 0.5 percent recorded for the last quarter of 2004. And with the United States and Chinese economies expanding steadily, demand for Japanese cars, televisions and factory equipment should remain strong, economists say.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another poll in February by SBTV.com, an online television network for small-business owners, 77.2 percent of those questioned said they planned to invest in new technology this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During an economic cycle, small businesses are one of the principle drivers of a rebound, since they account for a large portion of hiring and increasingly, a larger portion of total business investments,'' said Mat Johnson, an economist for the investment bank ThinkEquity Partners in San Francisco.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a large extent, he said, that is because they are nimbler than larger firms, which have huge inventory management concerns and layers of managers, making it harder for them to react to trends in the marketplace. In addition, he said, because they are often suppliers of goods and services to big corporations, they are the first to enjoy an upsurge in orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Greaney, chief executive and co-founder of Children's Progress, a New York educational-testing company, says he plans to spend $1 million this year for technology and infrastructure, twice last year's outlays, to accommodate an expected threefold to fivefold increase in revenues, from $1 million last year. The gains, he says, are the result of ''four major contracts coming into play.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children's Progress will also move to more spacious office quarters and add 12 people, from software programmers to sales staff, to its current 7, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see the economy is rebounding and that's good news for everyone because America's backbone is small business,'' Mr. Greaney said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses are also getting a boost in their expansion plans from a loosening of the purse strings over the past few months by venture-capital firms, banks and other providers of capital. ''I think right now there's an awful lot of money on the sidelines looking to be deployed,'' said Neal Verfuerth, founder and president of Orion Energy Systems, a maker of energy-efficient lighting systems in Plymouth, Wis. Orion Energy is now entering its fifth round of private financing in four years, he said, and expects to raise $10 million, double its previous record of $4.8 million in late 2004. He says he is already making preliminary plans for an initial public offering.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look back, everything is cyclical; there's always a boom-bust, boom-bust,'' he said. ''I think the next dot-com type thing is going to be energy and the environment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Verfuerth says his company has doubled sales every year for the past three years, to $24 million in the fiscal year that ended March 31, and expects to do the same in the year ahead. It has also increased its work force to 110, from 18 three years ago, and plans to hire 50 more this year in Manitowoc, Wis., where it bought a 260,000-square-foot plant six months ago to supplement its existing 22,000-square-foot factory in Plymouth. The new location will be used for manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and research and development, and will cost about $3 million to buy and upgrade, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs in the West and South exhibit the most optimism in the country, according to the American Express survey. It showed, for example, that 56 percent of small-business owners in the West expected to hire more staff in the next six months, compared with a 44 percent national average. Those findings were backed up by a survey in February by Union Bank of California in San Francisco of 1,941 small-business owners in the state. More than 70 percent of the owners said they expected business to improve this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Shepherd, president and owner of Pearlparadise.com, an on-line seller of pearls, has no doubt about it. His company moved into a 1,500-square-foot office in Santa Monica because it was bursting at the seams in a space about half the size. He also spent $25,000 on computers last year and plans to spend an additional $12,000 this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Business is growing astronomically and there really isn't any end in sight,'' Mr. Shepard said. Sales came close to breaking $5 million in 2004, up from $280,000 two years earlier, he said. ''People are actually buying jewelry again,'' he said. ''We had someone in December buy a $23,700 set of pearls online, the highest we ever sold.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To meet demand, Mr. Shepherd of Pearlparadise.com has been adding 1 to 2 workers a month and now employs 35.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture on hiring plans is not uniformly upbeat. The 44 percent of respondents to the American Express poll who said they planned to hire was down from 46 percent in the spring of 2004, though sharply higher than the 35 percent who reported such intentions last October. On the other hand, 90 percent of the 175 small businesses surveyed in February by International Profit Associates, a management consulting firm for small- to medium-size businesses, said they would maintain or increase the size of their staffs this year. Of that number, 42 percent said they planned to hire workers, up from 36 percent last August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Bushey, owner and founder of POS World, a supplier of bar code systems in Atlanta, plans to double his staff of five employees this year. He projects his company's sales of $13 million in 2004 will top $14 million this year. ''I think the time is right for small businesses to gain market share from the larger companies because they can't compete as they did before,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two dark clouds are hanging over the otherwise sunny small-business world -- soaring health insurance premiums and increased competition from China. To keep expenses down, only half of the businesses surveyed by Union Bank provided health benefits, and of those, about 20 percent had shifted more of the cost to employees last year. The American Express poll also found employers transferring costs to workers; the proportion that offered paid vacation fell to 52 percent, from 56 percent in 2004; the portion that offered paid holidays fell to 50 percent, from 57 percent, and the number that provided 401(k) plans fell to 20 percent, from 28 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bushey of POS World said his big worry was the impact of free trade, especially from China. ''It's a major problem small businesses are going to face,'' he said. ''It's pretty scary.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he maintained that forethought would give him the edge, pointing to the $100,000 he spent on equipment last year and the $100,000 he plans to spend this year. ''That's why I'm spending more money now,'' he said, ''bolstering our services so we can add more value to our customers and keep expanding our customer base.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: Joseph Bushey, top, the chief of POS World, a bar code systems supplier in Atlanta, and Ted Farnsworth, above, the chief of XStream Beverage Network of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., are among the majority of small-business owners who say their economic outlook is getting brighter.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BETHPAGE -- THE growth of J.D'Addario &amp; Company into a giant in musical-instrument accessories is a result of strategic planning and targeted marketing. But the loans arranged for the company by the Long Island Development Corporation cannot be underestimated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The L.I.D.C. helped to get us off the ground,'' said John D'Addario Jr., the executive vice president. ''They helped us with the financing we needed to build new facilities,'' he said, by assisting in getting three Small Business Administration loans.  </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.D'Addario, based in Farmingdale, makes strings for musical instruments. In 1980, the year it received a $175,000 Small Business Administration loan, which helped pay for the construction of a 25,000-square-foot headquarters, the company had 110 employees and sales of about $5 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By its third S.B.A. loan in 1989 -- for $220,000, to build a 14,000-square-foot building for the automation and printing divisions -- the company had more than doubled its number of employees, to 225, and sales had tripled, to $15 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the company has 950 employees, and sales last year totaled about $94 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.D'Addario is among the companies, including Sleepy's, Uncle Wally's and Gold's Pure Food Products, that have grown because of loan programs assembled by the development corporation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were with us, providing us with the right financial help when we needed it most,'' Mr. D'Addario said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year marks 25 years in business for the nonprofit private development corporation, which has closed 1,028 small-business loans worth more than $475 million. Loans worth another $100 million have been approved but have not yet closed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mission has always been the same -- it's about small businesses investing in capital assets,'' said Roslyn Goldmacher, a founder, the president and the chief executive of the development corporation. ''If they do, they expand, create more jobs and invest in the Long Island economy. It's just a win-win situation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The corporation, based in Bethpage, has 22 employees and offers a variety of loans to businesses, including its most popular, the government-backed Small Business Administration 504 loan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. 504 program works like this: The borrower puts down 10 percent, the development corporation picks up 40 percent and a bank covers the remaining 50 percent. The development corporation's money comes from government-backed bonds that have been pooled nationally by other providers in the S.B.A. 504 program and then sold to institutional investors. The loans are capped at different amounts depending on the type of business, ranging from $10,000 to $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a program that doesn't require small businesses to sink a lot of their cash into the investment of capital assets and allows them to continue to operate smoothly,'' Ms. Goldmacher said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development corporation's loan programs have also helped to attract and retain businesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a $1 million S.B.A. loan helped the Lanco Corporation, a chocolate manufacturer, buy a 70,000-square-foot plant in Hauppauge and expand it by another 50,000 square feet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They made doing business in New York possible,'' said Brian Landow, Lanco's president. ''Our new building allows us to keep operations here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Gold, an owner of Gold's Pure Food Products, which makes prepared horseradish and other condiments, said that in the early 1990's the company was considering whether to expand its plant in Brooklyn or relocate. The development corporation's financial plan lured the company to Hempstead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Long Island Development Corporation made it really easy for us,'' Mr. Gold said. ''They did all the work and gave it to us on a platter, and we came.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development corporation's list of loan programs includes the Long Island Minority and Women Entrepreneurial Loan Fund, which offers loans up to $50,000 for businesses owned by women or members of minorities, and the Long Island Small Business Assistance Corporation, which offers loans up to $10,000 for businesses owned by women.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development corporation has also helped Long Island businesses win more than $1 billion in government and private contracts under a procurement technical-assistance program, which it created with the Defense Department in 1986.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994 the development corporation started working with Fireworks by Grucci, in Brookhaven, and helped it win a $1.3 million contract to make simulated missiles for Army training exercises. The company has continued to work with the military.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been an excellent for us, and we are thankful to the L.I.D.C. for helping us to get started,'' said Phil Grucci, the executive vice president of Fireworks by Grucci. ''Without their help we would never be working with the government.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Crosson, the president of the Long Island Association, the largest business organization in Nassau and Suffolk, described the development corporation as a ''bedrock institution on Long Island.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the place where small business can turn to for financial help and get it,'' Mr. Crosson said. ''Roz and her staff are spectacular.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Goldmacher never planned on a career in the financial world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations in 1975 and imagined a career as a union leader or organizer. She then studied labor law at Hofstra and began working closely with Irving Rome, a lawyer who was involved with the Long Island Economic Development Corporation. Steve Gurian, a former Unisys lawyer, was its president.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Goldmacher received her law degree in 1978 and started her own practice, and she slowly grew enamored of the financing aspects of economic development. She founded the Long Island Development Corporation in 1980 with Mr. Rome and Mr. Gurian, both of whom have since died.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She managed to balance practicing law and working at the development corporation for years, but in 1990 she decided to work for the L.I.D.C. full time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never thought I would be doing this at all and never imagined giving up my career as a lawyer,'' she said, ''but now I can't see myself doing anything else.''  </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses are living up to their reputation as engines of economic growth, a new study shows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey to be released today by the Hewlett-Packard Company, 81 percent of 399 small businesses polled last month said they planned to increase their technology spending an average 20 percent in the next two to three years, and 68 percent said they would do so over the coming year.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollars will go toward items like computer hardware and software, upgrading of company Web sites, online services and even Web logs, the respondents said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Home Office Solutions Group, a seller of ergonomic chairs in Northbrook, Ill., is a case in point. Richard Burke, president of Home Office Solutions, says the company plans to double its technology spending this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Office was encouraged by results last year from its $50,000 investment in an ordering system, computers and an additional server. The equipment helped increase sales 25 percent, to $20 million, Mr. Burke said. The company projects a similar revenue increase this year, to $25 million, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to achieve that, it needs a computer system able to track order flows ''from the moment a customer picks up the phone, goes into our stores or goes to our Web site'' to the moment the product is picked up or shipped, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means Home Office Solutions, which has 45 employees at three sites in the Chicago area, must invest $100,000 this year in programming time and hardware, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Rutledge, chairman and economist of Rutledge Capital, a private equity investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., said the Hewlett-Packard study had huge implications for the economy because small businesses account for half of the gross domestic product and for three out of every four new hires.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It means more growth, more productivity, more employment,'' he said. ''They are all going to grow faster than Wall Street thinks. I think this is going to continue for some time, so you don't want to bet against the economy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Gilroy, senior vice president and general manager of Hewlett-Packard's segment for small and medium-size businesses, said increased investment in technology was inevitable, given that it had moved ''from being an appendage of small business to being the spinal cord.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those questioned in the survey, he said, listed retaining customers and streamlining operations as their top objectives, and technology as the means to achieve them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll, which was conducted by Harris Interactive, is the latest barometer of small-business optimism in an economy that some analysts worry may be vulnerable to rising oil prices and interest rates. Last month, American Express released a survey that said 85 percent of the 627 small businesses it surveyed saw growth opportunities in the next six months, up from 72 percent in a similar poll a year earlier. The survey also found that 66 percent planned to make capital investments within the next six months, up from 59 percent in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses will progressively build out the technology, hardware, software adoption because there is real value to be derived,'' said Carl Haacke, a former White House economic policy adviser in the Clinton administration. Now that the dust has settled from the technology boom and busts, he said, ''they can focus on how to best apply and implement these technologies to their business needs.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are promoting the trend, Mr. Gilroy said. According to the survey, small-business owners spend an average of 27 percent of their time outside the office. That leads them to buy equipment like laptops and BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices that give them the freedom to roam. In the survey, 32 percent considered notebook computers a critical part of their business, and 36 percent ranked them as their highest priority in technology spending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Mr. Gilroy said, small-business owners are more comfortable with technology today. And in many cases, their large customers require that they offer certain abilities, like online billing and ways to look up product information electronically.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Home Office Solutions' optimistic expectations for sales this year, Mr. Burke said, only continuing investment in technology can sustain the growth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need to have the right systems in place or else we'll fall short on the service end of our business,'' he said. ''That's what it's all about.''   </p>
