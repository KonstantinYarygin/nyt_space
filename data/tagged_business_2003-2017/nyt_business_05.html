<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the encouragement of Gov. Deval L. Patrick, Massachusetts insurance regulators took the extraordinary step Thursday of rejecting nearly 9 out of 10 rate increases requested by the state's health insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Patrick, a Democrat who is running for re-election, most likely against a former health insurance executive, said the move was needed because ''small businesses and working families can't wait any longer'' for relief. The requested premium increases, which were for individual and small-group plans, ranged from 7 percent to 34 percent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses cheered the state's intervention, but health insurers predicted disruption in the marketplace, including voided contracts and legal challenges. They said Mr. Patrick's main target seemed to be his leading Republican challenger, Charles D. Baker Jr., the former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Harvard Pilgrim Health Care</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Patrick's move, which Mr. Baker dismissed as ''an election-year gimmick,'' reflects the political advantage that many candidates perceive in attacking health insurance rates this year. Some analysts considered it a turning point in the health care debate in Washington when the Obama administration highlighted double-digit increases announced by Anthem <span class="companylink">Blue Cross of California</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, premium increases have never been more political,'' said Sandy Praeger, the insurance commissioner in Kansas and past president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ''If there is any way to justify not granting the increase, commissioners are looking for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama proposed in February that the federal government be given new powers to rule on whether premium increases are justified and to force insurers to reduce them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Congress did not go that far. The new law requires that the administration review premium increases annually, beginning this year. When rates are considered unreasonable, insurers will have to justify them publicly. But the law does not allow the federal government to control prices, leaving that authority to the states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States vary widely in regulation of insurance pricing. In California, for instance, the insurance commissioner, Steven Poizner, is reviewing Anthem's proposed increases of up to 39 percent. But he can deny them only if he finds that the company is not spending at least 70 percent of premiums on health claims, as required by state regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Massachusetts, the power to disapprove rates has been vested in the insurance commissioner since 1977. That authority had never been used before Thursday, said Insurance Commissioner Joseph G. Murphy, who was appointed by Mr. Patrick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, at Mr. Patrick's direction, the state's Insurance Division required health insurers to give the state 30 days' notice to review proposed rate increases scheduled to take effect April 1. Previously, insurers simply filed their increases when the new rates started, and they were rubber-stamped by regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Thursday, Mr. Murphy denied 235 of the 274 proposed increases. He said he disapproved requests when companies significantly exceeded the region's medical inflation rate of 5.1 percent, failed to justify why varying rates were paid to different hospitals, and did not forcefully negotiate prices with providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurers have a right to appeal, and rates from the previous year stay in effect in the meantime. Consumers will receive refunds or credits if they have already started paying higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murphy said his department estimated that the denials would save consumers -- and thus cost insurers -- $6 million to $8 million a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lora M. Pellegrini, the president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, called the denials ''a very reckless act'' and warned that insurers on thin margins might have trouble paying claims. Three of the state's four largest health insurers reported operating losses last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pellegrini said the timing of the announcement suggested that it was ''largely political.'' She said Mr. Patrick should focus attention on the primary cause of health care inflation, which she identified as rising medical costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Boston University study recently found that hospital costs per Massachusetts resident were 55 percent higher than the national average. An investigation this year by the state attorney general concluded that the pricing leverage exerted by academic medical centers played a major role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Arbitrary government price controls will not solve the problem and will likely cause unintended harmful consequences,'' the state's largest insurer, <span class="companylink">Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts</span>, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pellegrini warned that government rate regulation would splinter the coalition of stakeholders who have supported the state's pioneering universal coverage law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This feels like an unraveling of all that good work,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Barbara B. Anthony, the state under secretary for consumer affairs, who oversees the Insurance Division, said the state had studied whether the rate denials would pose a threat to solvency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During times like this,'' Ms. Anthony said, ''it's unfortunate, but reactions tend to be hyperbolic and exaggerated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Patrick has said the price controls are needed as a bridge until the legislature can act on his administration's proposal to restructure the way doctors and hospitals are paid. The governor and Democratic lawmakers are working to construct a system that would pay health care providers collectively to keep patients healthy while eliminating incentives that encourage unneeded treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Patrick has also proposed legislation that would give the state new authority to reject unreasonable hospital and physician prices, just as it did Thursday with insurance premiums.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a small business recuperates, it sucks up money -- to finance new hires, training, receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate and other things that support growth. And then you have to pay taxes. It is very easy for a business to end up with no cash left in the pot on April 15 to pay those taxes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a simple example: A company gets its sales up to $1 million a year. It is growing at 20 percent a year, which is a good rate. It has a 5 percent profit, which is a decent margin and should leave the company with $50,000 at the end of the year (after the owner's salary). The problem is that much, if not all, of that $50,000 can disappear into inventory and receivables to support the continuing growth. And then the tax bill arrives. Not only is the $50,000 long gone, but now the owner has to scrounge for cash to pay Uncle Sam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many solutions to this problem, including slowing growth (by raising prices or cutting back on advertising, for example), borrowing money, factoring receivables and taking in investors. There is another solution that is perhaps less obvious: Don't pay the taxes. Calm down. I am not promoting tax evasion, which is bad. I am promoting tax deferral, which is good. In fact, it is being promoted by no less an authority than the United States of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the government created 401(k) plans to allow individuals to delay paying taxes, it also offers Section 179 of the tax code to allow businesses to delay paying taxes. Section 179 lets businesses deduct the full price of any qualified property purchases immediately (up to $250,000 a year). Without this provision, the purchases would have to be depreciated over a number of years, typically five to seven. Section 179 is not news, but I'm not sure all business owners realize how useful it can be right now -- if your company needs equipment and if it will turn a profit this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To stick with my example, here is how Section 179 can create cash. Let's say the company needs a new delivery truck but the owner had been thinking of waiting until next year. It could buy the $40,000 truck in September with no money down, finance it with a 48-month loan, and write off the entire $40,000 this year. What would that mean? It would mean that the company would get the new truck it needed -- and additional cash flow of more than $9,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the math: The truck purchase and write-off reduces the company's profit by $40,000, which cuts the tax liability by $12,000 (with a 30 percent tax bracket). Meanwhile, the payments on the truck would be roughly $900 a month (or $2,700 over the last three months of this year). That gives you the improved cash flow this year ($12,000 - $2,700 = $9,300), and it means it will take about 14 months (14 x $900 = $12,600) for the monthly payments to equal the tax savings. Because the savings exceed the payments for 14 months, the truck purchase produces positive cash flow in 2010 and for most of 2011 (it matters that the truck was bought in September). Think about it: you could get the new truck you need -- and use the cash flow it generates to pay off your credit card debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a win, win, win. The business owner delays tax liability and gets new equipment (it doesn't have to be a truck). The economy benefits because of all of the trucks, computers, furniture and other things that companies buy sooner rather than later, creating work and jobs for delivery people, electricians, truck salesmen, computer programmers, etc. And in the end, the government collects the same amount in taxes -- it just takes a little longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax strategy is an important part of business. It is well worth the time to sit down with a professional business accountant to keep up with the current rules. It has been my observation that many business owners use accountants that do not specialize in business, or they try to save money by telling the accountant to just do their tax returns. Good accounting advice should pay for itself many times over.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AROUND the time that <span class="companylink">Apple Computer</span> was making it big in California, Andrey Shtorkh was getting a first-hand look at the Soviet approach to high tech: he guarded the fence keeping scientists inside Sverdlovsk-45, one of the country's secret scientific cities, deep in the Ural Mountains.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ostensibly, the cities were closed to guard against spies. Its walls also kept scientists inside, and everybody else in the Soviet Union out. While many people in the country went hungry, the scientific centers were islands of well-being, where store shelves groaned with imported food and other goodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security in these scientific islands was so tight, though, that even children wore badges. Relatives had to apply months in advance for permission to visit. ''It was a prison, a closed city in every sense,'' recalls Mr. Shtorkh, then a young soldier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he is the publicist for an improbable new venture. The Russian government, hoping to diversify its economy away from oil, is building the first new scientific city since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even more improbably, it is modeled, officials say, on Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, still nameless and near a village outside Moscow, is conceived not as a secretive, numbered city in Siberia but as an attempt to duplicate the vibrancy and entrepreneurial spirit of America's technology hotbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's rich scientific traditions and poor record of converting ideas into marketable products are both undisputed, cited as causes for the Soviet collapse and crippling dependence on mining and petroleum. Not surprisingly, then, its leaders look longingly at Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole country needs some sort of breakthrough,'' Viktor F. Vekselberg, the Russian business oligarch appointed co-director of the project, said in an interview. Mr. Vekselberg was chosen in part because of his investments in solar power, an unusual venture for one of the oligarchs who made fortunes in commodities. ''The founding of the innovation city, in form and substance,'' he says, ''could be a launching pad for the country as a whole.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He calls the city ''a test run of business models'' to rebuild Russian science for the capitalist era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once developed, the site is intended to incubate scientific ideas using generous tax holidays and government grants until the start-ups can become profitable companies. Its backers in government and the private sector describe it as an effort to blend the Soviet tradition of forming scientific towns with Western models of encouraging technology ventures around universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics see a deeper strain of Russian tradition: trying to catch up with the West by wielding the power of the state. Looking askance at the incongruous blend of the Kremlin's will and the openness prized by Silicon Valley, they refer jokingly to the new city as Cupertino-2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should not expect the same mechanisms that work in Silicon Valley to work in Russia,'' says Evgeny V. Zaytsev, a co-founder of Helix Ventures, a life sciences venture capital company based in Palo Alto, Calif., and a member of the advisory board of AmBar, the Russian business association in the real Silicon Valley. ''The government will be involved, because that is the way it works in Russia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the new city was conceived by what is called the Commission on Modernization, deep within the Kremlin bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian government, though, has a long and conflicted relationship with entrepreneurs and scientists. There is still a thriving tradition of government crackdowns on private business with capricious enforcement of the tax laws, making entrepreneurship difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Russia's hoped-for Silicon Valley is a panorama of muddy fields, birch groves, warehouses and storage sheds belonging to a state agricultural institute. The site was chosen for its proximity to another ambitious project, the Skolkovo business school, housed in a futuristic building financed by millions in donations from the oligarchs, including Mr. Vekselberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While similar ideas have been bandied about for years, this one was approved -- and blessed with $200 million in government money -- within a month of a visit in January to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by senior Kremlin leaders, including Vladislav Surkov, the powerful deputy director of the presidential administration. Mr. Surkov says the new city will isolate new businesses from the bureaucracy that handcuffs the Russian economy today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government-financed foundation will build and run the city. Directors of existing state-financed tech companies -- including Rusnano, a nanotechnology fund headed by Anatoly Chubais, a leading architect of Russia's controversial post-Soviet privatization -- will serve on the board and contribute money. Separately, a scientific council will decide which companies can locate at the site. The infrastructure should be in place within three years, Mr. Vekselberg says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zaytsev grew up in the Siberian city of Barnaul, got an M.B.A. at Stanford and worked for venture capital firms before founding his own. He approves of the experimental spirit of the new city. But he is skeptical that bureaucrats will be able to channel the money in ways that will transform Russia into a competitive force in consumer technology. Rusnano and the other state-financed venture businesses have had few successes thus far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The less control, the better,'' Mr. Zaytsev says. If the government ''controls the venture funds, no real venture funds will come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR a time, the Russian elite embraced petroleum as the ticket to restore the country's domestic economy, its standing in the world and its power in regional politics. Vladimir V. Putin, then the president, took to citing the stock price of <span class="companylink">Gazprom</span> as a national accomplishment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Gazprom</span>, a company that inherited title to the world's largest natural gas reserves, is now valued by investors at well below Apple, a company that sprang from a garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Kremlin's sensitivity to its trailing position in the wired world was on full display this year at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Putin, now the prime minister, and Michael S. Dell found themselves on the same discussion panel, and Mr. Dell asked in passing how he might help Russia develop its information technology sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Putin answered icily: ''We don't need help. We are not invalids. We don't have limited mental capacity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nationalistic Russian officials, it only rubs salt in the wounds that Silicon Valley companies so easily recruit bright Russian scientists. AmBar, the Russian business association, estimates that 30,000 to 60,000 Russian-speaking professionals work in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A marquee name in the high-tech world, the Google co-founder Sergei Brin, immigrated to the United States from Russia with his parents when he was a child. Had Russia been a different place, perhaps Mr. Brin might have started <span class="companylink">Google</span> there instead of in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia is hardly the first country to seize on the idea of copying Silicon Valley. In Malaysia, for example, a jungle has been cleared for a computer city called Cyberjaya that is a self-declared effort to imitate the south Bay Area. China has a cluster of high tech in Tianjin, outside Beijing, and France in Sophia Antipolis, near Nice, all created with an infusion of government aid -- and all eventually successful in attracting and fostering private business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of the oil boom, Russian officials suggested luring back Russian talent by building a gated residential community outside Moscow, designed to look like an American suburb. What is it about life in Palo Alto, they seemed to be asking, that we cannot duplicate in oil-rich Russia?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new effort, though, goes well beyond good housing. It also embraced the idea of encouraging new companies to commercialize the work done at university laboratories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian officials looked at Asian techno-parks with favorable tax treatment and established four of their own -- in Tomsk, Dubna, Zelenograd and St. Petersburg. Three were based in former closed scientific cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visions for Russia's Silicon Valley, though, are grander still. A proposed law would liberalize a host of tax, customs and immigration rules in ways that businesses have wanted for years. For example, the planners say they have studied the role of streamlined immigration rules in drawing talent to Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Dmitri A. Medvedev appointed Mr. Vekselberg the co-director of the project, a position that will probably evolve into one of two directors of the foundation to manage the new city. As a first order of business, he is to recruit a foreign businessman to co-direct the city with him; he has so far sent out about 100 letters to foreign business contacts who are potential candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, his own money is not tied up in the site. But Mr. Vekselberg's Renova group, whose primary assets are in metals and oil, has a significant investment in solar energy through a 44 percent stake in Oerlikon, a thin-film solar panel maker based in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vekselberg said he was surprised by his appointment but is now a true believer in the project and would like to attract a mix of start-ups, established companies and academic institutions. Mr. Medvedev, in a televised meeting about the new city, emphasized commercialization: ''The new technologies which we are creating are not toys for eggheads,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new town is intended to advance five scientific priorities laid out by Mr. Medvedev -- communications, biomedicine, space, nuclear power and energy conservation -- and to encourage cross-fertilization among disciplines. Property will not be owned, but rented, and the government will offer grants for scientists who struggle to find private financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In California, the climate is beautiful and they don't have the ridiculous problems of Russia,'' Mr. Shtorkh said. To compete, he said, Russia will form a place apart for scientists. ''They should be isolated from our reality,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials have painted the Russian Silicon Valley in sweeping ideological terms. Russia, they say, will again be defined by the depth of its scientific talent, rather than by its mines and wells. The government has appointed as scientific director a Nobel laureate in physics, Zhores Alferov -- whose discoveries in the 1950s were cited by the Nobel committee as paving the way for cellphones (which the Soviet Union, incidentally, never made).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH-TECH entrepreneurs who stayed in Russia are more skeptical. Yevgeny Kaspersky, founder of the Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus company, says that he is pulling for the site to succeed but that the government should confine its role to offering tax breaks and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started his own business in Moscow in the 1990s, working nights on his hobby of capturing and studying computer viruses, but he benefited from a special economic zone for start-ups only when he opened an office in Tianjin in 2003. The Chinese government gave him free office space for a year and a tax holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Russia has a lot of talented software engineers but not a lot of successful businesses,'' he said. ''People still have an iron curtain in their minds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old scientific cities were entangled with the military, but they also reflected futuristic and utopian strains in Soviet thinking. Isolating scientists in Siberian enclaves -- removed from the struggle for groceries that defined many other citizens' lives -- and provisioning them with laboratories yielded results in the Soviet nuclear weapons and space programs. With talented, low-cost work forces, the cities remain attractive, even to foreign investors: I.B.M., Intel and others have opened offices and labs in formerly closed Russian cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, critics say, is that the government today intends to corral Russian engineers and scientists without knowing what it wants. The model, instead, should be maximum exposure to competition and the vagaries of consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't understand what they need,'' said an adviser to the Kremlin, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''They don't need another atomic bomb, and they don't need new televisions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planners, meanwhile, are looking for a name. One suggestion was ''Innograd,'' for Innovation City, echoing with a self-deprecating humor the boisterous Soviet nomenclature for new ventures like ''Magnitogorsk,'' or Magnetic Mountain -- the name given to a gigantic steel mill in the Ural Mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option was ''Gorod Solntsa'' or Sun City, a reference to the nearby Moscow neighborhood of Solntsovo. This suggestion, though, may undermine the idea of turning a new page, as Solntsovo is also the name of a famous organized-crime group from the 1990s that got its start in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shtorkh, the former closed-city guard, prefers an Apple-esque iteration: iGorod.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Ethan Siegel's wife, Lalenya, returned from her law office to their Manhattan apartment covered in soot from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the couple decided to find work that would let them spend more time together. And so, in 2003 Mr. Siegel and a friend started Orb Audio, a maker of high-end home theater systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the value of the dollar dropped in 2008, Mr. Siegel noticed a boom in calls and Web visits from abroad. He began marketing with Internet ads and country-specific Web pages aimed at consumers in Britain, Australia, Finland and Canada.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 18 months, international sales at Orb Audio, which brings in more than $5 million annually, have risen to 35 percent of total sales from 10 percent, offsetting a 10 percent domestic slump in 2009. Total sales in February were up about 75 percent over last year, almost exclusively on foreign orders from as far away as Zimbabwe, Nigeria and -- three times in the last six months -- Easter Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somehow, 10 percent of our business is in Finland because a couple years ago someone got our speakers and wrote a nice review in an Internet forum,'' said Mr. Siegel, 39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many small companies, and President Obama, Mr. Siegel's experience is one to be emulated. During his State of the Union address, the president announced the National Export Initiative, a program aimed at doubling American exports in five years. As part of the initiative, the Obama administration increased the budget of the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration by 20 percent to $540 million to help advocate for American businesses abroad and called on the <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank of the United States</span> -- which provides export financing when private banks cannot or will not -- to increase financing for small- and medium-size businesses to $6 billion from $4 billion over the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, although the United States exported $1.55 trillion in goods and services last year, it is still isolated. Fewer than 1 percent of America's 30 million companies export, a significantly smaller percentage than those of other developed countries. Of the companies that do export, those with fewer than 20 employees, like Mr. Siegel's, represent 72 percent of the exporters and 14.2 percent of the value of goods exported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some ways to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHOOSE A MARKET ''You can't do a thing until you find customers,'' said Laurel Delaney, founder of GlobeTrade, an export consultancy based in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most small businesses do not know how to do that abroad, so exporting often comes from serendipity: an entrepreneur makes a chance friendship with an overseas importer or someone calls from abroad with an order. ''It sometimes works out,'' said Cliff Paredes, director of the International Trade Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio. ''But the first contact may not be from the right market or from the right partner. If you're reactive, there's a risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be proactive, direct-to-consumer sellers can follow the model of Mr. Siegel, who used <span class="companylink">Google</span> AdWords, the Internet advertising platform, to direct keyword ads to people in specific countries. For products that go through a foreign distributor, Mr. Paredes advises exporters to classify their products under the internationally standardized Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, then look at trade data to determine which countries are importing those products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once that has been done, industry trade shows are often a good place to find foreign importers eager to carry products in the exporter's country of choice. The Commerce Department's U.S. Commercial Service and the Small Business Administration's network of Small Business Development Centers also help small businesses find markets and customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUILD RELATIONSHIPS While Americans are used to getting straight to business -- often over the phone -- most foreign countries require serious relationship-building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Relationships are the holy grail of cross-border businesses,'' said Duncan J. McCampbell, president of McCampbell Global, a Minneapolis small-business export consultancy. ''As Western business people, we're the product of a stable legal system. Someone cheats you, you sue them, you get your money. It's not like that in other countries. If you don't spend time with people, you will fail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About five years ago, Glenn Williams, president of Bell Performance, a 17-employee fuel additive company in Longwood, Fla., began a big push into overseas markets. Attracted by opportunities in China that he had discovered through Alibaba.com and the Commerce Department, he went to Asia to meet potential customers in 2000 -- but not before enlisting a friend who was familiar with Asian markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He said, 'Whatever's put in front of you, eat it with a smile.' I ate eel, fish eyes, pickled heart of monkey, or something like that. We learned to use chopsticks before we left, though I probably lost a few pounds from food jumping out of my chopsticks,'' said Mr. Williams, 34. ''And we learned that in Japan you're supposed to introduce yourself to the top person first and then move down the line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today the company is in almost 30 countries, and last year 40 percent of its revenue came from exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CUSTOMIZE YOUR PRODUCTS Not every product has a market outside the United States. Those that do meet certain criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're targeted to a narrow segment of the market that no one's serving and that pays a premium and isn't subject to local low-wage competition,'' Mr. McCampbell said. ''The first thing you got to ask yourself is, 'Can someone make it cheaper in China, India or Vietnam?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even then, exporters need to do thorough market research to modify products to fit local norms. When Peter Cole took over Gamblin Artists Colors, an art-supply company in Portland, Ore., in early 2007, international sales accounted for less than 5 percent of revenue. So, flying about 80,000 miles in 2009, Mr. Cole built relationships with stores and distributors in Israel, Australia, Mexico, Britain and Spain. And he found he had to tailor his products. ''In Australia they want larger sizes of paints -- sizes we haven't contemplated for the U.S. market -- particularly for printmaking inks,'' Mr. Cole, 37, said. ''People tend to paint bigger, and thicker.'' International sales at the company, which brings in almost $5 million annually, rose to 10 percent of revenues last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Kyle Schroeder, president of the Cremo Cream Company, a Los Angeles shaving cream start-up, customization occurred for legal reasons: To sell in Canada, he needed to put his tubes in a box so that he could include the required French documentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMEMBER TO MAKE A PROFIT Because of shipping costs, import duties, compliance requirements and added middlemen, profit margins are usually lower in exporting. In Mr. Schroeder's case, adding a box increased his cost by more than 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New exporters often make the mistake of signing a contract before they understand market regulations or nail down how and when they will be paid. For protection, it can be helpful to demand advance payment for small transactions or, for larger ones, to draw up a letter of credit -- a contract that requires payment before the delivery of goods -- between the buyer's bank and the seller's. And it is essential to bone up on Incoterms, the internationally standardized system that defines when a product passes from the exporter's possession to the importer's and who has to pay for what part of shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lag time between export orders and payment can tax a small business. To handle this, the Export-Import Bank offers financing that allows small businesses to borrow against their receivables as well as receivables insurance that lets them offer payment terms to foreign clients.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You win a bet, but the loser does not have enough cash on him to settle it. If he has a credit card, and most people usually do, there is finally a solution. A number of big and small companies -- including <span class="companylink">eBay</span>'s <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> unit, <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, VeriFone and Square -- are creating innovative ways for individuals to avoid cash and checks and settle all debts, public and private, using their cellphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the companies have developed small credit card scanners that plug into a cellphone and for a small fee enable any individual or small business to turn a phone into a credit card processing terminal. <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>'s cellphone app calls for only a simple bump of two cellphones to transfer money. Apple has submitted a patent application for a cellphone payment system.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Kusler, 40, a software engineer, is already helping dollar bills join Susan B. Anthony coins as collector's items. After he polished off grilled lamb and zinfandel at a San Francisco restaurant recently, his dining companion paid the bill and asked him for his share. Instead of hunting down an A.T.M., the two bumped their iPhones together, and Mr. Kusler wirelessly transferred his part of the bill, about $100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't carry a lot of cash; I don't think anyone does these days,'' Mr. Kusler said. ''We go out, and I oftentimes have to remember to pay my friends back when we get home, and I want to be able to just do it right there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is evidence that paper money is being used less often, according to the Federal Reserve. Though cash payments are difficult to track, the number of noncash transactions in the United States grew from fewer than 250 a person in 1995 to more than 300 in 2006. Data on the stock of small-denomination bills and destroyed bills indicates that the use of cash peaked in the mid-1990s and has been declining since, two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When debit cards were introduced in the early '90s, that was the beginning of the slow and gradual decline of paper checks and cash,'' said Red Gillen, a senior analyst at Celent, a research and consulting firm on technology and financial services, based in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, cash has remained essential in certain instances, like paying back a colleague for lunch, buying fruit at a farmers' market or buying a beer at a cash-only bar. These new mobile payment technologies could finally change that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem with cash is that it is tangible, it's inconvenient, you have to carry around a bunch of bills and you have to continually go to the A.T.M.,'' said Jack Dorsey, a Twitter co-founder who is now the co-founder and chief executive of Square, which makes a dime-size device that anyone can plug into the earplug jack of an iPhone or iPad to instantly accept credit card payments. ''If we can make cards more convenient and faster, it can replace a lot of the experiences around cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light wallets are not a problem for Joe Mangrum, a sidewalk sand painter in New York, who has been using Square to take donations from passers-by and sell copies of his book. Sales have increased sharply since he started accepting credit cards on his iPhone, he said. ''I've made the sale as opposed to twiddling my thumbs because they don't have the cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new services could have the biggest impact on the smallest businesses, like farm stands or house cleaners, that accept only cash and checks because they do not have stores to house credit card terminals and do not want to enter into complicated, long-term relationships with credit card companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Ancliffe, a clothing designer in Portland, Ore., sells her dresses and blouses at sample sales and from her home, and uses <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> GoPayment to process credit card payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't accept checks because then you're just kissing your product goodbye'' because of fraud and bounced checks, Ms. Ancliffe said. ''I sell 10 times more because I take credit cards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraud protection offered by the credit card companies is the same as when the card is used at a cash register. Some of the new companies say security against fraud might even be improved because they provide e-mail receipts, and those from Square include photos and a map of where the transactions were made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death of cash has been predicted since the 1970s, when electronic transactions like direct deposit of checks were introduced. But most digital payment experiments, like one in 2006 by Visa, have focused on swiping cellphones, as is popular in countries like Japan, instead of credit cards. Mobile payments have not taken off in the United States because Americans are just as happy to reach into their pockets for a plastic card as for a cellphone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of replacing credit cards, technologies like Square and GoPayment rely on them. Credit card companies stay in the middle, extracting a fee with each swipe or bump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GoPayment costs $12.95 a month on top of a per-transaction fee of 30 cents plus 1.7 percent to 3.7 percent of the payment, depending on the credit card companies' rates. Square is free and users pay 15 cents plus 2.75 percent to 3.5 percent of each transaction. It will be available for iPhones and iPod Touches in May and for other phones and laptops later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exchanging money with friends using <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>'s iPhone app is free if payers use a bank or <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> account, and costs 30 cents plus 2.9 percent of the transaction for credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though people will use cash less, it is not nearly extinct, said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice president for financial institutions policy at the American Bankers Association. ''Historically, we have seen more failed innovations in payments than we've seen successful ones, because you have to convince people that it's secure, more efficient and reliable,'' Mr. Abernathy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a cashless society could become a reality as the younger generation, accustomed to buying music on iTunes and virtual gifts on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, grows up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Older people still tend to like to use cash or checks,'' Mr. Abernathy said. ''Younger people don't want to touch a piece of paper. They want to do it all electronically.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- An unlikely new tenant in the halls of the Federal Reserve would set out sweeping rules on a wide swath of consumer transactions, possibly making it one of the most powerful new federal agencies in a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed agency is causing concern and confusion, however, among owners of small businesses -- drug stores, jewelers, pawnbrokers and car dealers -- who fear that by allowing any customers to buy on credit, their businesses could be subject to significant new regulations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the headlines about the Senate's consideration of a financial regulation bill have concerned financial giants like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and complex investments like synthetic collateralized debt obligations, the proposed Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is a major part of the legislation, is likely to be an intense battleground in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the bewilderment -- and therefore the argument -- stems from the imprecise nature of some of the proposed rules. The new agency would regulate financing provided by most car dealers, for example, but not by rent-to-own furniture vendors, according to the bill's advocates. Department stores with private-label credit cards would be covered; stores that let their customers pay in installments, without interest, would not, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of the consumer protection provisions, which account for 335 pages of the 1,565-page bill, shows that the intent of the legislation is not to cover Main Street businesses. But the ambiguity of some terms -- like the word ''significantly'' -- leaves the regulations open to a broad interpretation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Democrats and Obama administration officials say nearly all nonfinancial businesses would be exempt from the new bureau's regulations, which would focus narrowly on consumer finance businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a large number of different types of companies across the country involved in the finance business, consumer finance business, that took advantage of the current system and left people with financial obligations they did not understand, could not afford, were not appropriate for them, and the damage of that was catastrophic,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said at a Senate hearing on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Republicans and business groups have countered that the new agency's approach is scattershot rather than focused, and would stifle the ability of small Main Street businesses to offer credit to strapped customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich Gallo, the owner of Office Outlet, an office products company in Indiana, Pa., said he regularly devised payment plans for his customers, and was concerned that the consumer agency would impose a new layer of regulation. Told that the bill's advocates say his business would probably not be covered by the bureau, Mr. Gallo remained skeptical. ''I just think that is the way our government seems to be going right now, to more regulation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill also would cast a broad net, opponents say, over companies that had little to do with the housing crisis and subsequent recession -- a group known as nonbank financial companies, which includes such longtime Democratic targets as payday lenders, which make short-term loans at high interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is growing concern that in an effort to hold Wall Street accountable, this bill could catch the little guys up in the same net as the big banks,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said earlier this week after the Senate agreed to begin debate on the bill, formally known as the Restoring American Financial Stability Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its ''ambiguous language,'' Mr. McConnell added, ''there is real concern that this bill could penalize anyone in this country who buys or sells something on an installment plan,'' potentially subjecting any merchant that offers credit that is subject to a finance charge or extends over more than four installments to the authority of the consumer bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crux of the debate would appear to rest on the definition of ''significantly.'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the primary sponsor of the bill, points to a section that says the new bureau cannot regulate ''a merchant, retailer or seller of nonfinancial goods or services that is not engaged significantly in offering or providing consumer financial products or services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might seem to rule out auto dealers, which, after all, are principally engaged in selling cars and trucks. But roughly four out of every five car loans are generated by the dealers themselves, according to the Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy, a Washington research group that says it believes dealers should be covered by the agency. The dealers set the interest rate, and the loan fees that they earn are a big contributor to their profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, Democrats say, makes most auto dealers enough of a financial company to fall under the new bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some small-business owners support the creation of the consumer agency, saying they are not threatened. ''There is nothing onerous in these regulations,'' said Lewis Prince, the owner of Vintage Vinyl, a St. Louis music retailer who participated in a news conference Wednesday sponsored by senators who support much of the Dodd bill. Consumer protection ''can only help small business by providing the kind of stable financial environment in which small businesses can thrive,'' Mr. Prince said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as businesses say the bill might be too far-reaching, some consumer advocates fear that the bureau will be able only to write rules, not enforce them. The bill would give the bureau enforcement powers over ''larger participants'' in nonbank or nonmortgage lines of business, like payday lending. How to define ''larger'' is left up to regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both sides seem to agree that the consumer agency has an ample amount of independence -- and maybe too much for some lawmakers. The bill states that the agency can demand that companies furnish information about ''the organization, business conduct, markets and activities of persons operating in the consumer financial services markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would require the Federal Reserve to turn over 10 percent of its operating budget each year to finance the agency. That would leave the new bureau with a budget of nearly $500 million -- 75 percent larger than the budget of the Federal Trade Commission, another agency that currently has consumer protection responsibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the new agency's powers, businesses and their advocates in the Senate are more concerned over who will be regulated. ''No one can deny that the language of the bill is ambiguous, that it lends itself to broad interpretation, so let's tighten it up,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''The authors of this bill may believe some of these concerns are misplaced. But they are going to have to prove it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH CAROLINA last month began an audit of online businesses, assuming that millions of dollars in sales taxes owed to the state had disappeared into the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really an issue of fairness and equity for small businesses, the brick and mortar, corner store operations,'' said Kenneth R. Lay, the state's secretary of revenue. ''These businesses are at a competitive disadvantage when they have to collect sales taxes that other businesses do not.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The response of one of those online businesses, Amazon.com, was succinct: back off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Seattle, the company said that the audit violated the First Amendment and privacy rights of the customers, as well as the company itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case offers a glimpse at the changed landscape of privacy in the United States. Under the old model, the law was meant to protect the public from a snooping government. And the government was generally the only entity with the resources to snoop on people in a systematic way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the online snooping (make that ''data collection'') never stops. Can the old tools really prevent the government from closely monitoring its people when so much information is a mere Internet search away? And is the government the one we really need protection from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon's lawyers say the Constitution protects the company so that it ''may sell -- and customers may read, hear or view -- a broad range of popular and unpopular expressive materials with the customers' private content choices protected from unnecessary government scrutiny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complaint gave examples of books Amazon had shipped to North Carolina: ''Bipolar Disorder: A Guide for Patients and Families,'' by Francis Mark Mondimore, and ''He Had It Coming: How to Outsmart Your Husband and Win Your Divorce,'' by Stacy Schneider. The movies, the complaint said, included ''Lolita,'' ''Brokeback Mountain'' and ''Fahrenheit 9/11.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a telling list: imagine what the government could do with ''Converting to Islam for Dummies'' or ''Plant Your Own Marijuana Field.'' For this reason, privacy experts say, library records have been granted special protections and are generally not kept for long, lest they offer a tempting target for investigators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing, though. There happens to be an organization that does have a good idea of who is reading what -- Amazon. For many isolated people, Amazon is the closest thing to a library. The closest thing, perhaps, until <span class="companylink">Google</span> enters the e-book business, and knows what books you have bought and even what pages you've read online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Lay said North Carolina never wanted to know the titles of books or movies that were sold. ''It is important to know whether a book or steak was sold, but we don't care about the title of the book or the type of steak,'' he said, adding that the tax rates are different in each case. ''We have too much data. The last thing we need is data we don't need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute over whether Amazon will have to reveal the names of its customers, without the titles, is still in court. ''To comply with their demand will reveal the personal preferences of North Carolina consumers,'' Amazon said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit can seem like the front line of the battle for privacy in the Internet age, with Amazon on the barricades holding back an overreaching government. After all, the company does not share its purchasing lists with anyone. And as Amazon argued in federal court, its business would be hurt if it ever did, whether in aid of tax collection or as a business proposition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Customers who fear that their purchases will not be private are less likely to purchase books, movies, music or other items that might be personal, sensitive or controversial,'' the company argued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What remains is a sobering combination -- on one hand, there is the detailed information held by companies like Amazon and <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which have a strong business incentive to fight off the government. Yet even as they go to court to protect the information they have collected, that information still represents a ''honey pot for the government,'' Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cases where the government gains a court's approval, it would have access to a trove of material that 10 years ago would be unthinkable in its detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's why we are trying to convince all people who store data not to do it,'' she said. ''We need to strengthen the law that when we collect information for one purpose, it isn't used for another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there is all the material that roams freely available on the Internet, particularly on social networks like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, which are convinced that more sharing is what their users want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This information can find its way to the government without need of a warrant, Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor of law at Fordham University, says. And while each piece of data can seem innocuous, when collected and weaved into a personal profile, it can be quite revealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If a private company has information, they can sell it,'' including to the government, he said. ''You need a warrant when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy,'' he added, but if a private company has the information, on what basis would someone expect it to be private from the government?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bleed from privately held data to state surveillance can happen very quickly,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the recession having left many banks reluctant to lend, small businesses have struggled to find other sources of credit. One intriguing alternative is On Deck Capital, which promises to revolutionize lending to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional banks, says Mitch Jacobs, On Deck's founder and chief executive, know so little about their small-business borrowers that it scares them off.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Deck, by contrast, says it scours ''the cloud'' for the vast information trail that every business now leaves to develop a clear understanding of a potential client's creditworthiness. It seeks businesses with positive cash flow, ideally from a lot of small-ticket transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes no collateral, and -- here's the biggest difference between On Deck and traditional lenders -- the loan is repaid automatically with daily deductions from the borrower's bank account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capital does not come cheap: the annualized interest rates can reach as high as 36 percent. Since opening in 2007, On Deck has made 2,000 short-term loans, putting $60 million in the hands of small-business owners, typically in increments of less than $30,000. A condensed version of a conversation with Mr. Jacobs follows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.If the credit markets were functioning the way they should, would there still be a place for On Deck?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There's been trouble in credit on Main Streets for decades. In 2006, when we launched the company and liquidity was everywhere, over five million Main Street small businesses were declined for credit because of a low personal credit score. Several million of those have the cash-flow stability in their businesses to be able to service a loan, but the existing system doesn't detect that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What information does On Deck look for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The full picture. What cash is coming in, what cash is going out? What is the pattern and stability of their customer activity? How diversified is their customer base? The fundamental building blocks are their online banking information, their payment processing information, and their accounting information -- 60 percent of our users today have QuickBooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you continue to collect data about businesses after they have paid off their loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If they ask us to. Because they then are credit-ready the next time they need capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Is this like revolving credit, then, or a credit card?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No. It's very important that when a small business borrows for the purpose of some type of equipment replacement, inventory or marketing that they pay down the capital in the time period that they are using the money. Otherwise, they won't be able to borrow again the next time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of people think if you've purchased a refrigeration unit that has a five-year lifespan, then you should have a five-year loan. But that's the wrong way to look at it. The question is: what's the next big-ticket purchase and when is that going to come up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.But the interest rate you charge is pretty high, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The average right now is in the low 20s. It's consistently below 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How much of that does On Deck keep?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Actually, the way we designed the program, businesses pay us a fee of $500 and up to act as a virtual director of finance. One of the advantages that we have is that, since we validate all of the information electronically, we are able to share with the business owners where their strengths and weaknesses are and provide a significant amount of what would be called technical assistance. They pay us for the On Deck service, and then we pass through the cost of the capital from the market to the borrower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What might a business learn from you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. From a cash-flow standpoint, just as an example, we're providing them with ranking information -- where they stand in comparison to similar businesses in their industry. And also when it looks like the rate at which their cash is going out is greater than the rate at which the cash is coming in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Couldn't they just look at their checking account to see whether the cash going out is greater than the cash coming in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The business owner may not have really studied, on an ongoing basis, the cash-flow trends in their business, and they're also not aware of at which point the cash-flow profile of their business might concern a source of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Studies show that a business is more likely to fail if it has more credit card debt, owing to the high interest rate. But On Deck's interest rates are often higher still. What does that say about the outlook for your customers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Our businesses have on average a million dollars of revenue, and what you and I are talking about right now is a $2,000 difference, if that, at the max, on a $30,000 loan. So everyone needs to stop talking about optical interest rates on short-duration, small-dollar transactions, because it is resulting in businesses not getting access to capital that they can much more than afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.But a lot of these businesses are going to be low-margin businesses, where every thousand dollars is a lot of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're working with businesses that have a significant amount of cash flow, and they wouldn't be qualified for our program if they didn't have it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How often do your borrowers default?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.. Toward the tail end of 2008, we had a peak in the loss performance of the portfolio. But it's never crossed 10 percent, and typically it operates well below that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Payday lenders and credit card lenders often say that their loans are expensive because the borrowers are risky, and the cost of their loans reflects that risk. Why are your loans so expensive?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There is a misperception about the risk, but in order to dislodge capital from underlying capital sources, the pricing of the risk is in line with their requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You clearly have a higher loss rate than banks do on commercial loans. What's the misperception?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We've got large pockets of businesses that consistently show very low loss rates; we've got other business groups in the middle and others that show higher loss rates. The On Deck system is helping to parse out the different populations of businesses, and they will be able to access lower and lower-cost capital as there's more history and more businesses in the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Presumably, if the loans weren't risky, you wouldn't need to collect a payment every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The daily automated system of collection provides a few different benefits, one of which is to reduce the risk of serving this marketplace. It also makes it easier for the business, and it also helps the business get out of debt faster so that it can take on the next challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Where do you get the capital to lend out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We have a series of family offices, institutions and hedge funds that provide capital. We've created the pipe for them to be able to reach the small borrowers that they've never been able to reach before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.It seems what you're talking about is a transfer of wealth from poor people to wealthy people. Isn't there a way to find different sources of capital?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. One of our objectives is to create a sustainable and scalable availability of capital for Main Street. If we had gone and gotten a $5 million grant, we'd have tapped out 1,700 small businesses ago. We didn't want to do that. We wanted to solve this problem once and for all.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the aim of depoliticizing a largely Republican assault, the leading lobbying group for small businesses has joined officials from 20 states in their legal challenge to the new health care law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An amended complaint filed Friday in Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., lists the lobbying group, the National Federation of Independent Business, as a plaintiff in the lawsuit that was originally filed in March by attorneys general from 13 states.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attorneys general or governors from seven other states formally joined the lawsuit on Friday. Among the state plaintiffs, only Attorney General James D. Caldwell of Louisiana is not a Republican.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two individuals also joined the litigation. One is the uninsured owner of an automobile repair shop in Panama City, Fla. The other is a man from Washington State who prefers to pay his medical bills out of pocket rather than being compelled to obtain insurance, as will be the case starting in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The additions of the business association and individual plaintiffs, according to lawyers involved, were intended to shift any public perception that the lawsuit was primarily a political device. But the new plaintiffs also may help the states fight an anticipated challenge by the federal government to their standing, or legal authority, to bring the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Florida lawsuit is among at least a dozen filed against the Democratic health care law since President Obama signed it on March 23. Virginia's attorney general has filed a separate case in Richmond, and other lawsuits have been mounted by physicians' groups and conservative legal centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cases typically focus on the provision that will require most individuals to obtain commercial or government health insurance, a mandate with few precedents in American policy or jurisprudence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuits argue that the insurance requirement, by penalizing people for not purchasing a product, represents an unconstitutional extension of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has responded in court filings that an individual decision to not purchase insurance is, in effect, a decision about how to pay for future medical care. Taken in the aggregate, those decisions substantially affect interstate commerce by shifting the cost of covering the uninsured to policy-holders, health care providers and taxpayers, government lawyers maintain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In papers submitted this week in a Michigan case, the Justice Department vigorously attacked the plaintiffs' legal standing to challenge an insurance mandate that does not take effect until 2014, and thus has yet to cause any harm. In the Florida case, the federal government's response -- in the form of a motion to dismiss the lawsuit -- is not due until June 16. Oral arguments are scheduled for September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the health care law provides substantial tax credits to small businesses that provide insurance to employees, the National Federation of Independent Business wound up opposing the legislation because of what it viewed as unacceptable mandates and costs for its members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The outpouring of opposition to this new law was overwhelming,'' said Dan Danner, the group's president, ''and our members urged us to do everything in our power to stop this unconstitutional law.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOST borrowers are facing a much tougher mortgage environment than a few years ago, but for those who are self-employed or own small businesses, maneuvering through a loan application can be even more arduous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before 2008 these borrowers, many of whom have difficulty documenting their income, often used what are known as stated-income loans. Lenders focused on credit histories and earnings estimates, circumventing the need for pay stubs or W-2s.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during the mortgage crisis, stated-income loans became known as ''liar's loans,'' because some borrowers falsely inflated their incomes, and qualified for more than they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, stated-income loans have nearly disappeared. Those still available through regional lenders like <span class="companylink">Hudson City Savings Bank</span> come at a cost: interest rates around a quarter of a percentage point higher than conventional loans and down payments of at least 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-employed borrower's only choice, mortgage brokers say, is to submit two years' tax returns and hope that they qualify for a conventional loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would not be a problem, the brokers said, if all self-employed people filled out their tax returns conservatively. But in this economic climate, the self-employed have been more likely to lighten their tax liabilities by taking business deductions, thereby lowering their official income levels, as well as the likelihood of qualifying for a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to be more conservative about how you claim your deductions, or how you approach unnecessary purchases for the business,'' said Robert Duquette, the president of the New York Association of Mortgage Brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duquette says that self-employed borrowers will have no trouble qualifying for loans if they have significant cash, as well as credit scores of at least 700, and stable and significant profit for the previous two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many small-business owners, hit by the recession, are showing losses on their income tax statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, a borrower can make an argument for extenuating circumstances, like reserve duty for a few months, or a temporary hospitalization,'' said Regina Mincey-Garlin, the president of RCG Mortgage Solutions in Montclair, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Duquette of the New York Mortgage Brokers Association said the mortgage crisis had hurt small-business owners more than others. ''Everyone who's getting income from places other than salary and wages is getting hit harder than everyone else,'' he said, ''because they're being scrutinized more carefully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And those who have only recently started a business -- perhaps after a layoff -- may face even greater difficulties, he added. During the recession, many companies laid off workers, hiring them back on a contractual basis. Because these people have no long-term history of stable earnings, Mr. Duquette said, lenders often reject their applications or impose higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, self-employed applicants shouldn't give up hope, said Debra Killian, the president of Charter Oak Lending, a mortgage broker in Danbury, Conn. Many people wrongly assume they cannot qualify for a loan at all, she said, ''but 30 percent of the time -- maybe 40 -- they'll qualify. They may be frustrated at all the documentation we ask them to provide, but they can still qualify.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners considering whether to qualify a purchase as a business or personal expense on their taxes, Ms. Killian said, should do the math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a business owner shows too little net income to qualify, say, for a $300,000 mortgage at 5 percent, and instead qualifies for a 5.25 percent loan, the monthly payments add up to an extra $5,520, roughly, for the first 10 years of the more expensive loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you save yourself a few thousand dollars in taxes in a year by taking those extra deductions,'' Ms. Killian said, ''how much will that cost you on your mortgage, or your ability to even get a loan?''</p>

The Senate finally responded earlier this month when it added price controls on the controversial fees to its financial reform bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House version contains no such measure, so these necessary controls can become law only if the amendment survives the reconciliation process.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fees, which can get as high as 3 percent of the purchase amount, are set by the card companies, which pass on about 80 percent of the money to the banks that issue the cards, which induces the banks to issue more cards. Last year, businesses paid nearly $20 billion in debit transactions to the two companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system is troubling for several reasons. First, the fees charged by the networks far exceed the actual cost of processing a transaction. They are set by Visa and <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>, which control about 80 percent of the market. That means the companies can raise prices without fear of competition. And the fee schedules are so complicated and confusing that merchants often don't know what the fees will be or how they are derived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amendment, from Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat of Illinois, strikes at some of the tactics used by the card networks to limit how merchants do business. For example, if it became law, the card networks could no longer prohibit merchants from offering discounts to customers based on the method of payment -- a rule that is being investigated by the Justice Department. The card networks also could no longer require merchants to accept cards for small transactions that are too small to justify the fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By requiring the Federal Reserve to set fees at a level that is ''reasonable and proportional,'' the amendment could save small businesses billions of dollars a year and make it likely that customers would see lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Congress can also protect debit card holders directly. It could, for example, pass debit card reform bills pending in both the House and Senate that would stop the banks from using their remaining sleight of hand to trigger ruinous overdraft fees that are especially damaging to people on fixed incomes. The bills would limit the number of overdrafts to six each year and require that the fees be proportionally related to what the transaction actually costs the bank.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berkeley, Calif.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST year was a fabulous one for entrepreneurs, at least according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity released last month by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. ''Rather than making history for its deep recession and record unemployment,'' the foundation reported, ''2009 might instead be remembered as the year business startups reached their highest level in 14 years -- even exceeding the number of startups during the peak 1999-2000 technology boom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another surprise is the age of these new entrepreneurs. According to the report, most of the growth in startups was propelled by 35- to 44-year-olds, followed by people 55 to 64. Forget Internet whiz kids in their 20's. It's the gray-heads who are taking the reins of the new startup economy. And if you thought minorities had been hit particularly hard by this awful recession, think again. According to the report, entrepreneurship increased more among African-Americans than among whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, all this seems a bit odd. Usually new businesses take off in good times when consumers are flush and banks are eager to lend. So why all this entrepreneurship last year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a word, unemployment. Booted off company payrolls, millions of Americans had no choice but to try selling themselves. Another term for ''entrepreneur'' is ''self-employed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics by an outplacement firm, Challenger Gray &amp;Christmas, the number of self-employed Americans rose to 8.9 million last December, up from 8.7 million a year earlier. Self-employment among those 55 to 64 rose to nearly two million, 5 percent higher than in 2008. Among people over 65, the ranks of the self-employed swelled 29 percent. Many older people who had expected to retire discovered their 401(k)'s had shrunk and their homes were worthless. So they became ''entrepreneurs,'' too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe this is a good thing. A deep recession can be the mother of invention. These Americans are now liberated from the bureaucratic straitjackets they thought they had to wear. They can now fulfill their creative dreams and find their inner entrepreneurs. All they needed was a good kick in the pants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this upbeat interpretation doesn't include lots of people who don't particularly relish becoming their own employers, like an acquaintance whom I'll call George. George was an associate partner at one of the world's largest technology and consulting firms until he lost his job last year in a wave of layoffs. For months, George knocked on doors but got nowhere because of the deep recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, his old firm got some new projects that required George's skills. But it didn't hire George back. Instead, it brought him back through a ''contingent workforce company,'' essentially a temp agency, that's now contracting with George to do the work. In return, the agency is taking a chunk of George's hourly rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, George is his own boss. But he's doing exactly what he did before for less money, and he gets no benefits -- no health care, no 401(k) match, no sick leave, no paid vacation. Worse still, his income and hours are unpredictable even though his monthly bills still arrive with frightening regularity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's official rate of unemployment does not include George, nor anyone in this new wave of involuntary entrepreneurship. Yet to think of them as the innovative owners of startup businesses misses one of the most significant changes to have occurred in the American work force in many decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically each year, large numbers of Americans leave their old jobs to find new ones. Unemployment rises during recessions mainly because companies hire fewer workers, not because they lay more people off. But this Great Recession has been different. Layoffs by mid-sized and large companies have surged while hiring has almost disappeared. These companies have used the sharp downturn as an opportunity to cull their payrolls for good -- substituting labor-saving technologies and outsourcing to workers abroad or to contract workers here. This explains why almost half of America's unemployed have been jobless for more than six months -- a greater proportion than at any time since the Great Depression. It also explains why so many people like George have joined the ranks of the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, a growing number of Americans went out on their own before the recession, but clearly their numbers have vastly increased. While some are happy about their new status, most are worse off than they were before. It's one thing to be a contingent worker in good times and when you're young; quite another in bad times when you're middle-aged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many would rather view these people as entrepreneurs and owners of startup businesses, and see their major challenge as getting adequate credit. Congress's Joint Economic Committee reported last week that small businesses continue to face tight lending standards. ''Small business is the job-creation engine that powers this economy,'' said Representative Carolyn Maloney, the New York Democrat who heads the committee. Democrats will be pushing bills to make loans more available to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, America's startup businesses do need better access to credit. But many entities that look like small new businesses are actually self-employed people who need more than bank loans. They need predictable income and benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, they could use what might be called ''earnings insurance'' that would pay for up to two years part of the difference between what they earned on the old job and what they earn now on their own. Employed workers would contribute to the insurance fund through their payroll taxes, as they do with unemployment insurance, but the total bill for benefits would be unlikely to rise because earnings insurance would get them back to work quicker and thereby reduce the number of weeks they relied on unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-employed also need more help saving. Since they can no longer depend on tax-free corporate matches to their 401(k)'s or I.R.A.'s, they should be entitled to tax credits that match them. Fortunately, thanks to the reform package passed by Congress, they will have more help getting affordable health care, as they will be able to use their aggregate bargaining power in medical exchanges to push down insurance costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New businesses are vital to job growth, and entrepreneurship does fuel the economy. And surely some of America's new independent workers will build their own companies. But when the economy is still so hard on so many, it's important to distinguish between entrepreneurial zeal and self-employed desperation.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Thursday that banks needed to increase lending to small businesses to reduce unemployment and help the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outstanding loans to small businesses declined to $660 billion in the first quarter of 2010, from almost $700 billion two years ago, Mr. Bernanke said, adding that it was difficult to tell whether the decrease was a result of reduced demand or tightened credit standards. In any case, he said, increasing the flow of capital to small companies was crucial to the recovery.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While maintaining appropriate prudence, lenders should do all they can to meet the needs of legitimate, creditworthy borrowers,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a meeting at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</span>'s branch in Detroit. ''Encouraging lending to small businesses that are well positioned to pay is a positive, not a negative, for the safety and soundness of our banking system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy small businesses are critical to job growth but have a harder time expanding payrolls than large companies without sufficient access to credit, Mr. Bernanke said. He said only 40 percent of small businesses that tried to borrow in 2009 had all of their needs satisfied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to complaints from small-business owners, the Obama administration has proposed a $30 billion fund that would encourage community banks to increase lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's event was one of 40 being sponsored by the Federal Reserve across the country. Findings from the meetings will be discussed at a conference this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke did not discuss monetary policy or his outlook on interest rates as he gave brief remarks and responded to several questions from local bankers and business owners. He later listened in on a discussion about the financing needs of automotive suppliers, a sector heavily populated with small and medium-size companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite four consecutive quarters of economic growth, Mr. Bernanke said unemployment was still one of his ''important concerns.'' He spoke in a state with a 14 percent jobless rate, the highest in the nation. The national jobless rate was 9.9 percent in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the reasons that unemployment has not fallen more is that credit standards are in many cases still ''so restrictive that good loans are not getting made,'' Mr. Bernanke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He urged banks to examine loan applicants' businesses thoroughly and to ''avoid mechanical, automatic rejections'' based solely on the companies' industry, location or other negative factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've still got a long way to go, but I'm hopeful that we'll see improved conditions for credit going forward,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''The Federal Reserve views this as being absolutely central to the recovery.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have a son or daughter graduating from college this year, you've probably gotten the word. When meeting this year's college grads it's best not to ask: ''Hey, what are you doing next year?'' Too many recent graduates don't have an answer. They can't find jobs even remotely related to their fields. This year's graduation theme is: ''Don't ask. Can't say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We owe our young people something better -- and the solution is not that complicated, although it is amazing how little it is discussed in the Washington policy debates. We need three things: start-ups, start-ups and more start-ups.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good jobs -- in bulk -- don't come from government. They come from risk-takers starting businesses -- businesses that make people's lives healthier, more productive, more comfortable or more entertained, with services and products that can be sold around the world. You can't be for jobs and against business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, though, relations today between the Obama administration and ''business'' are pretty strained. I'm not talking about Wall Street, which deserves Obama's lash. I'm talking about people who actually make stuff and sell it. I am talking about entrepreneurs and innovators. A surprising number of them told me they had voted for Obama, and an equally surprising number of them now tell me they're unhappy. A lot of their criticism is unfair. Obama has never gotten the credit he deserves for stabilizing the terrifying economy he inherited -- with virtually no help from Republicans. And business is never going to like anyone who raises income taxes, especially to pay for other people's health care -- even if it is in the national interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, I think part of the business community's complaint about Obama has merit. Although there are many ''innovation'' initiatives ongoing in this administration, they are not well coordinated or a top priority or championed by knowledgeable leadership. This administration is heavily staffed by academics, lawyers and political types. There is no senior person who has run a large company or built and sold globally a new innovative product. And that partly explains why this administration has been mostly interested in pushing taxes, social spending and regulation -- not pushing trade expansion, competitiveness and new company formation. Innovation and competitiveness don't seem to float Obama's boat. He could use a buoyant growth strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What might that include? I asked two of the best people on this subject, Robert Litan, vice president of research and policy at the Kauffman Foundation, which specializes in innovation, and Curtis Carlson, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">SRI International</span>, the Silicon Valley-based innovation specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlson said he would begin by creating a cabinet position exclusively for promoting innovation and competitiveness to ensure that America remains ''the world's new company formation leader.'' ''Secretary Newco'' would be focused on pushing through initiatives -- including lower corporate taxes for start-ups, reducing costly regulations (like Sarbanes-Oxley reporting for new companies), and expanding tax breaks for research and development to make it cheaper and faster to start new firms. We need to unleash millions of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Litan said he'd staple a green card to the diploma of every foreign student who graduates from a U.S. university and push for a new meaningful entrepreneurs visa (the current one, the EB-5, requires $1 million of capital that few foreign entrepreneurs have). It would grant temporary residence to any foreigner who comes here to establish a company and permanent residency if that company generates a certain level of new full-time jobs and revenues. One of the best moves we could make, adds Litan, would be a long-term budget deal that would address the looming Social Security/Medicare payouts for baby boomers. Proving to the bond market that we have our long-term fiscal house in order would keep long-term interest rates low and thereby ''encourage private investment more than any tax cut.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, I'd also cut the capital gains tax for any profit-making venture start-up from 15 percent to 1 percent. I want our best minds to be able to make a killing from starting new companies rather than going to Wall Street and making a killing by betting against existing companies. I'd also impose a carbon tax and balance that with a cut in payroll taxes and corporate taxes. Let's tax what we don't want and encourage what we do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fortunately, this is the best time ever for innovation,'' said Carlson, for three reasons: ''First, although competition is increasingly intense, our global economy opens up huge new market opportunities. Second, most technologies -- since they are increasingly based on ideas and bits and not on atoms and muscle -- are improving at rapid, exponential rates. And third, these two forces -- huge, competitive markets and rapid technological change -- are opening up one major new opportunity after another. It is a time of abundance, not scarcity -- assuming we do the right things with a real national growth strategy. If we do not, it rapidly becomes a world of scarcity.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, I visited the inaugural gathering of Sharp Skirts, an online and offline community of women who own a wide range of businesses -- or who aspire to become their own bosses. Sharp Skirts was founded by Carla Thompson, a former Silicon Valley marketing executive and Austin transplant. ''I got tired of reading articles that asked where the women entrepreneurs were,'' said Ms. Thompson. ''I was surrounded by them and knew they had an abundance of skills to share.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And share they did, during a luncheon attended by some 30 women -- entrepreneurs of every stripe, M.B.A.'s weighing moves from corporate America and business leaders eager to offer guidance in their areas of expertise. The women discussed and debated everything from the best way to secure funding from Austin's tight-knit venture-capital community to the professional benefits of watching SportsCenter. Tina Cannon, chief executive of PetsMD, swears a daily dose of the ESPN program gave her an edge when chatting up male investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Thompson, however, isn't so sure. ''Why should we have to be men?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the path of least resistance,'' replied Ms. Cannon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Which is why Tina has funding,'' said Lynn Slayton Yeldell, a financial adviser with <span class="companylink">UBS</span> and co-founder of L Style G Style, a lifestyle magazine for leaders in the gay and lesbian community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the group parted reluctantly, cards were exchanged and last-minute insights were offered along with promises to continue exchanging information and advice. What struck me most about the accomplished members of the Sharp Skirts community was how typical they seemed in terms of their enthusiasm for helping each other. I am guessing there are many similar communities of women business owners, both formal and informal, across the country</p>

The panel, chaired by former President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, met behind closed doors, but Mr. Clinton said that future meetings would be open. The commission announced $45 million in grants from Brazil and Norway to help the government close its budget gap and a $20 million fund created by Frank Giustra, a Canadian businessman, and Carlos Slim Helu, a Mexican businessman, to provide loans for small businesses. Resolving central issues like debris removal and moving Haitians out of tent camps will take time, Mr. Clinton said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- It was a little-noted vote on an unremarkable bill, but it spoke volumes about the current state of Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House was considering a measure to give tax advantages to small businesses, debating the sort of imperfect but well-intentioned legislation that would have previously breezed through since it was aimed at a favored constituency of both parties and provided tangible benefits in a rocky economy. And it was paid for.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the final vote of 247 to 170 broke almost strictly along party lines, with only five Republicans voting for the measure even though a senior Republican responsible for tax issues acknowledged that there were positive aspects to the bill. Instead, Republicans offered an alternative that would have repealed a central element of the new health care law, a proposal that had zero chance of passing but made for a good political attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outcome left Representative Sander M. Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, scolding his colleagues across the aisle. ''You say you agree with these provisions, but then you're going to vote no,'' he said as the floor fight wrapped up. ''You just don't apparently want to be caught being bipartisan. It's going to blur the political message.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach of the midterm elections, the angry state of the electorate and intense political positioning have deepened partisan divisions in Congress to the point where it is becoming nearly impossible to lure lawmakers across the aisle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon has shown itself in the Senate as well in the current impasse over a package of tax breaks and safety-net spending. Extending unemployment benefits in times of economic duress used to be a popular vote, but not one Republican was willing to join Democrats on Thursday to break a filibuster holding up added jobless pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his weekly address on Saturday, President Obama made note of the impasse, saying he was ''disappointed this week to see a dreary and familiar politics get in the way of our ability to move forward on a series of critical issues that have a direct impact on people's lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addressing the unwillingness of Republicans to allow a vote on extending jobless benefits, Mr. Obama said that ''if this obstruction continues, unemployed Americans will see their benefits stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Teachers and firefighters will lose their jobs. Families will pay more for their first home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''I know the political season is upon us in Washington. But gridlock as a political strategy is destructive to the country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Republicans say they want to keep the $40 billion cost of extending jobless benefits from being added to the deficit. But the deficit was not the issue on the small-business measure in the House. Republicans said it came up short despite what they conceded were worthwhile features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While the tax relief in here is welcome, it's not enough,'' said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, one of the five Republicans to back the tax plan and one of just three to vote for a small-business loan program a few days later, said the gulf between the parties had grown so wide that most Republicans simply refused to vote for any Democratic legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is just the politics of the time,'' said Mr. Castle, who is running for the Senate. ''We are just into a mode where there is a lot Republican resistance to voting for anything the Democrats are for or the White House is for. I think part of it is where the polling is and how things seem to be going from a political point of view. It is an election year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Castle said that the hardening divisions were not good for the nation's future, and that it was not just Republicans who needed to give some thought to their approach, but Democrats as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Republicans say they are not dismissing Democratic initiatives out of hand; they say that the Democratic view of how to govern is simply wrongheaded and that they will not be a part of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I realize my colleagues on the other side of the aisle sometimes can't understand why Republicans vote against their ill-conceived legislation,'' said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina. ''It is really because we have a very different philosophy about what makes this country successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that philosophy was not ''taking money from hardworking taxpayers,'' funneling it through the bureaucracy and returning some to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Mr. Castle conceded, politics are at work as well. If Republicans were to vote for Democratic legislation, it would represent a tacit acknowledgment that some Democratic ideas merit support -- not the message Republicans want to send right now. They are working hard to portray Democrats as inept and themselves as a worthy alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Republican base has moved into an agitated, anti-Democratic posture. So any Republican who backs Democratic legislation runs the risk of being accused of consorting with the enemy and facing a challenge from the right or falling out of favor with conservatives like those allied with the Tea Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deep unwillingness to cross party lines also reflects some fundamental changes in the nature of Congress in an increasingly polarized era. The ranks of veteran lawmakers experienced in working together and cutting deals are diminishing at the same time the political and media environment is providing greater rewards to those engaged in conflict rather than compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the deep reluctance to consider opposition legislation will persist after November is an open question, and perhaps outside events will again force the parties to work together. But as the split on the small-business measure showed, the chances for much legislative cooperation between now and Election Day appear remote.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 18 months or so, this question has become tougher to answer as a flood of products with names like Voldemort, Hadoop and Cassandra have appeared on the scene.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are part of a new wave of highly specialized technology -- both software and hardware -- built by and for Web titans like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span> to help them break data into bite-size chunks, and present their Web pages as quickly and cheaply as possible, even while grappling with increasing volumes of data. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, for example, created Cassandra to store and search through all the messages in people's in-boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The products, championed by a bustling crop of start-ups, reflect a potential changing of the guards here in the technology world's heartland as young companies try to capitalize on radical shifts in the way new and old businesses run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a foment happening,'' said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive at SeaMicro, a hardware start-up that hung up its shingle last week. ''It's a bubbling of ideas and technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the original dot-com boom, companies tended to buy the fastest, most expensive systems so that they could manipulate ever larger, centralized databases of information. But this approach has proved too costly and cumbersome for the types of work that companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> tend to do now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus instead is on taking chunks of information, chopping them up and spreading the data across thousands of computers and storage devices. It's a divide-and-conquer approach to making the avalanche of data produced online manageable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To complement the changes in software design, some hardware makers have emerged with new kinds of computer systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SeaMicro, for example, unveiled a line of computer servers that run on Intel's Atom chips, usually found in hand-held devices and smartphones. Mr. Feldman argued that these chips have enough oomph to display Web pages and handle other basic Internet tasks, while consuming far less power than more muscular chips usually found in computer servers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of some other engineering tweaks, SeaMicro can fill a refrigerator-size cabinet with about 10 times as many chips as a standard computer server system, while saving customers on power and space costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Internet has brought about a tidal wave of this particular kind of traffic,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''You have to build specialist types of parts to deal with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialized hardware systems like SeaMicro's, and that of Schooner Information Technology, another hardware start-up, have appeared alongside equally specialized software, like Project Voldemort, Cassandra, CouchDB and MongoDB. This kind of software can arrange and store information without the expensive, traditional databases sold by <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>, I.B.M. and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mozilla, which helps produce the popular Firefox Web browser, has to support more than 400 million users of its technology and has found the rising cost of power to run its data centers frustrating, said Justin Fitzhugh, the company's vice president for engineering operations. The company has been testing a SeaMicro system and discovered that it handled lightweight computing jobs well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It wasn't feasible 10 years ago to use large numbers of low-power chips because the software to make that work wasn't available,'' added Bobby Johnson, a director of engineering at <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. ''We have crossed a point of scale where we have to spread things across lots of small machines to be cost effective.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schooner Information Technology packs its systems full of the high-speed memory similar to that found in iPods and cellphones to create a type of appliance that can hold huge quantities of often-viewed information at the ready. This lets a company send out prized information from its computer center at a quicker clip than using more traditional techniques that require hunting across slower data storage devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Bryce, an executive at the Web site management company Rackspace, said that mainstream companies had started to use these new types of technology, particularly the software, as they too became overwhelmed with data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know of a large financial services company using Cassandra to store data produced by their trading simulations,'' Mr. Bryce said. ''They need the same data in London, Hong Kong and New York and could not get this to work with traditional databases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen O'Grady, a founder at the technology analyst company RedMonk, said the technology industry often has swung back and forth between more standard computing systems and specialized gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, we are heading toward a specialist period now,'' he said. ''It's part of a trend where thinking in Web scale is starting to become more of a requirement for businesses.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress headed for a recess over the weekend having failed to agree on legislation to address the nation's fragile employment picture, with both parties placing starkly different bets on the political consequences of their positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress are hoping that voters will punish Republicans in the midterm elections for obstructing his efforts to extend unemployment benefits, expand lending to small businesses, and increase aid to struggling state and local governments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Republican leaders in Washington just don't get it,'' Mr. Obama said in his weekly video address on Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican lawmakers have clung to the view that uneasy voters will instead judge the White House harshly for failing to quickly rein in budget deficits that threaten to shake market confidence and saddle future generations with record public debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At some point we have to say, enough is enough,'' said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who delivered the Republican response to the president's message. ''We have to make tough decisions about spending beyond our means.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After lawmakers return from this week's Independence Day recess, they will have just a month before they break for the summer. Historically, significant legislation is unlikely to pass in the late summer and early autumn before an election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposing positions have hardened even though the unemployment rate, 9.5 percent as of Friday, has barely budged from its peak of 10.1 percent in October. Underlying the divisions are fundamentally diverging diagnoses for what ails the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somehow the politically correct position on the deficit has become cut, cut, cut, irrespective of the economic consequences,'' Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat and the chairwoman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To liberals like Ms. Maloney, premature belt-tightening not only spells more difficulties for the jobless, but also risks a double-dip downturn. ''Most economists agree the economy is too fragile to sustain the kinds of spending cuts politicians are talking about now,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she agreed on the need for long-term deficit reduction, but added, ''the deficit battle is being played out on the backs of unemployed workers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents of austerity speak with just as much conviction. In a hearing on Friday, after the Labor Department reported that employers added a mere 83,000 private-sector jobs in June, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee, argued that fiscal discipline was vital to restoring confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Businesses are slow to hire because they fear higher taxes, job-killing regulation and a dysfunctional Washington that is ideologically driven and increasingly anti-business,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brady added: ''Unless their excessive spending deficits and debt accumulation are quickly reversed, the United States may experience a debt crisis similar to Greece.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee, went even further. ''I reject the false premise that only forceful and sustained government intervention in the economy can secure this country's renewed prosperity,'' he said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emphasis on debt reduction has been particularly frustrating to observers from the left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every effort to dig the nation out of the unemployment abyss ''is being stymied by excuses about the deficit,'' said Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''It is a national disgrace that members of Congress are heading home to celebrate our nation's birthday after having voted repeatedly not to create jobs or to extend unemployment aid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heather Boushey, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy organization, said the White House had been lukewarm about stimulus measures, resulting in uncertainty among its Democratic allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't seen the administration get out in front of some of the more progressive jobs proposals,'' she said. ''There's been a wariness among the administration folks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's political aides have tended to emphasize voter worries about the deficit, while his economic advisers have been urging additional stimulus spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also have counseled patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will not be able to reverse overnight two devastating years of recession and a decade of declining economic security for the middle class,'' Alan B. Krueger, the Treasury Department's chief economist, said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Economic recoveries don't move in straight lines,'' he said in a meeting with reporters. ''However, the fact that private-sector employment expanded for six months in a row is an indication that the trend line is pointing in the right direction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a May hearing of the Joint Economic Committee, Mr. Krueger, the assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy, said that even before the start of the recession in 2007, the United States job market had already been performing weakly, relative both to the 1990s and to the rest of the industrialized world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After gaining 21.7 million payroll jobs in the 1990s, the economy lost 944,000 from December 1999 to December 2009, Mr. Krueger said in his testimony. The fraction of the working-age population that reported being employed peaked at 64.7 percent in March 2000, and fell to 58.6 percent in March 2010, its lowest level since the two recessions of 1980-82, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses, which shed large numbers of workers during the recession, have been particularly slow to resume hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Krueger's remarks at the hearing were not widely reported, their implications were clear: raising taxes can support both deficit reduction and job growth. He testified that the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 ''did not result in better performance in the labor market than was achieved in the 1990s, a period when government revenue increased, and the deficit was reduced and eventually eliminated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether that perspective will shape the policy debate will become clear in the coming months. In the meantime, some experts say that job creation and deficit reduction are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, told the House Budget Committee last week, ''It is important -- in fact I'd say it's vital -- that you continue to provide some additional temporary stimulus to the economy.'' But he added, ''Once the economy is on a sound footing, it is critically important that you do pivot as quickly as possible and address the long-term fiscal situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David M. Walker, the president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization that has focused on cutting long-term deficits, said the ''myth that we cannot address our current economic crisis and our long-term fiscal crisis at the same time'' had become an obstacle to bipartisan agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In our view, the answer is to continue to pursue selected short-term initiatives designed to stimulate the economy and address unemployment, but to couple these actions with specific, meaningful actions designed to resolve our long-term structural deficits,'' Mr. Walker testified last week to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the bipartisan panel named by Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel's report is due Dec. 1 -- four weeks after the midterm elections.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOLEDO, Ohio -- Just one day after leaders of the House of Representatives announced a ban on earmarks to profit-making companies, Victoria Kurtz, the vice president for marketing of a small Ohio defense contracting firm, hit on a creative way around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep the taxpayer money flowing, Ms. Kurtz incorporated what she called the Great Lakes Research Center, a nonprofit organization that just happened to specialize in the same kind of work performed by her own company -- and at the same address.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the center -- which intends to sell the Pentagon small hollow metal spheres for body armor that the Defense Department has so far declined to buy in large quantities and may never use -- has $10.4 million in new earmark requests from Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congresswoman, who has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Ms. Kurtz's family and her business's lobbyists, thought the quickly hatched nonprofit organization was a convenient solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They met the requirements of the reform,'' Ms. Kaptur said in an interview. ''Yes, they did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed earmarks are among dozens -- totaling more than $150 million -- from around the country that would indirectly benefit profit-making companies, according to an examination by The New York Times of House appropriation requests submitted after the new rule was imposed in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adopted because of repeated scandals over wasteful spending -- the bridges to nowhere and expensive pet projects like a water-taxi service -- the ban was intended to help eliminate earmark abuses. Critics say spending on earmarks, which added $16 billion to the federal budget last year, diverts money from higher priorities, typically does not require competitive bids and is often directed to experimental research that will never be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given the appeal of free government money, the fees that lobbyists can earn by helping businesses grab a handful of it and the persistence of lawmakers in trying to satisfy constituents or donors, the pay-to-play culture in Washington has once again proved hard to suppress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It reminds me of the line from ''Jurassic Park'' -- 'Life will find a way,' '' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has pushed for nearly a decade to curtail earmarks. ''When you have easy money like this, it finds a way, and members find a way to enable. And that is happening again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ignoring the spirit of the ban, some lawmakers are leaving it up to Congressional committees to block them, a prospect that both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill concede will be near impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No matter what they tell you, there is just no way they can police all that,'' Mr. Flake said. ''They just don't have the time or resources.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative Approaches</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have shown remarkable ingenuity in skirting the rule or veiling their requests through nonprofit organizations, the Times review found. Among the examples:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Virtual Reality Medical Center, a California-based company that sells visual simulation headgear as an experimental form of medical therapy, had sought nearly $6 million in earmarks before the ban. Soon after, company officials instead proposed that the money go to the Interactive Media Institute, a nonprofit group controlled by the center's top executives, which had been set up to sponsor educational conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An aide to Representative Corrine Brown, the Florida Democrat who submitted the request, acknowledged consulting with Virtual Reality executives and then jointly deciding to redirect the earmark. ''The rules were that nonprofits can apply, so a nonprofit did,'' said Lee Footer, a senior legislative assistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pennsylvania, <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> is likely to get as much as 80 percent of a $2 million earmark proposed by Pennsylvania State University for research on clean-burning GE locomotives. At the suggestion of the company and the university's lobbyist, according to a Penn State professor, the university is listed as the lead player in the collaboration instead of GE, as was done previously. GE executives made a series of political contributions to Representative Kathy Dahlkemper, Democrat of Pennsylvania, days after she submitted the earmark request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the Copper Development Association, a nonprofit group controlled by copper manufacturers, is pursuing a $4.1 million earmark to hire suppliers to install its members' copper products in New York City subway cars, asserting that the metal has qualities that inhibit the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a group called the Solar Energy Consortium in Kingston, N.Y., is pursuing nearly $30 million in earmarks, with the help of Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, Democrat of New York. The group, working out of a tiny office above a machine shop, does not perform its own research. Instead, it plans to pass on most of the earmark money to local businesses, some of which directly collected federal earmarks for solar projects this year but would no longer qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profit-making companies were singled out for the earmark ban because their requests, routinely submerged in giant budget bills by their allies in Congress, tended to be more questionable than those sought by nonprofit groups, which include charities, local governments and educational institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Republicans, trying to show their resolve to clean up Congress, pledged not to propose any earmarks this year, though at least three Republicans declined to go along. Democrats have submitted billions of dollars in requests; the exact total is unknown because there is no comprehensive listing of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and Appropriations Committee chairman who announced the ban, declined to comment on the new earmark rule. But his spokesman, Ellis Brachman, said he was unaware of any cases in which profit-making companies had tried to circumvent it or in which House Democrats had assisted them. He added that the panel was committed to finding such cases, if they exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Quick Response</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 9:33 a.m. on the day after Mr. Obey announced the earmark ban, Ms. Kurtz filed the necessary papers with the Ohio secretary of state for her nonprofit organization. She named herself the executive director, and that afternoon, her brother, Daniel K. Wedding, set up a Web site for the organization, even though it had not received the required federal approval to operate as a tax-free entity. With that, they considered the problem of the earmark ban solved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not illegal -- so what?'' said Carol Ann Wedding, who is Ms. Kurtz's sister and the president of Imaging Systems Technology, their family-owned business. She and other family members defend the charity as legitimate, though they offered varying explanations for its purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last four years, Imaging Systems had failed to interest the Pentagon in buying more than a few samples of its hollow metal spheres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undeterred, Ms. Kaptur helped the company arrange a total of $8.4 million in earmarks, part of it essentially to force the Defense Department to buy a large order of the metal spheres, which is pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Ms. Kaptur, a 14-term congresswoman, a member of the House Appropriations Committee and a top earmark sponsor, publicly praised the new ban, telling an Ohio newspaper that it ''struck the proper balance between retaining a role for the legislative branch in funding worthy projects and eliminating any potential for abuse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But privately, Ms. Kaptur's office encouraged Ohio companies whose earmark requests were in peril to quickly line up deals with nonprofit organizations. Members of her staff even called University of Toledo administrators to ask about forming partnerships with local defense contractors, said Frank J. Calzonetti, the university's vice president for research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Ms. Kaptur is seeking at least $12 million for the university for programs that this budget year were allocated directly to profit-making companies, with the understanding that the university will pass on most of the money to the companies previously involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of how these collaborations would work were left unresolved, Mr. Calzonetti said, though the university agreed to participate only if it could make a substantive academic contribution. And, he said, the university would get a portion -- at least $70,000 on a $1 million appropriation -- to cover the cost of a faculty member and a researcher to work with the partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the deals involved Nokomis, a Pennsylvania-based defense contractor for which Ms. Kaptur secured a $1.2 million earmark last year. (The company had opened a small office in her district -- a standard courtesy, as were the company-affiliated campaign contributions.) Now, the university would accept the earmark and then funnel most of the money back to Nokomis for that same project -- designing a new type of roadside bomb detector, Mr. Calzonetti confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the companies has a lobbyist to smooth negotiations with officials in Washington. Nokomis, for example, retains Scott Harshman, a former aide to the late Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat and longtime Appropriations Committee chairman legendary for securing earmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kurtz's business has a contract with Joseph F. Boessen, a former Armed Services Committee staff member and lobbyist at the PMA Group, a now-defunct firm under investigation over accusations that it traded campaign contributions for earmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happy to Oblige</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kaptur said she was pleased that the Ohio defense contractors could form alliances that allowed her office to resubmit the earmark requests. Her first commitment, she said, is to help the Pentagon defend the nation. But if she can deliver government money to local businesses, that is a bonus, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am a member who does fight for my region and my state,'' she said, then adding, ''I don't fight mindlessly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some House members have backed away from the type of requests Ms. Kaptur has championed. Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, for example, refused to request money for a similar collaboration between his state university and a defense contractor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, also withdrew a requested $2 million earmark to the Rochester Institute of Technology, which also had a corporate partner. But she did so only after being contacted by The Times last week. She said that she had misunderstood the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many other members said through spokesmen that they were standing by their requests and leaving it up to the House Appropriations Committee to decide if they are acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the earmark requests come from major corporations like <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span>, perhaps best known for its Predator drones. Over the last several years, the company has approached state university officials in Kentucky, Mississippi and Texas about jointly pursuing federal money to accelerate research on its patented technology to convert algae into jet fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under these agreements, about half of the earmark money goes to <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span>, officials involved in the deals said, an arrangement that would continue next year, despite the ban. But in at least one state, Texas, the company's name has been stripped this year from the publicly listed sponsors of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> spokesman, Jim Elliott, declined to comment on the project, which is also supported through competitively awarded grants. ''I don't want to talk about how we get money,'' he said. ''There are a lot of competitors out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal records show that the company has made a series of contributions to the sponsors of the requests, including Representatives Ben Chandler of Kentucky and Solomon P. Ortiz and Ciro D. Rodriguez of Texas, all Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Atomic's university partners defend the projects and their research contributions. But they concede that there is no mystery why <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> would seek local partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You think our congressman is going to write an appropriation request for some San Diego company?'' said Bruce R. Pratt, chairman of the Eastern Kentucky University Department of Agriculture, a partner with <span class="companylink">General Atomics</span> on algae research. ''Why would he do that?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: A Tally of Pet Projects: House Democratic leaders banned earmarks for private companies in March, limiting these Congressionally directed allocations to nonprofit groups, universities or government entities. Despite the ban, many Democrats have submitted requests for earmarks that would indirectly benefit profit-making companies. A sampling:; How One Business Secured Earmarks: Ms. Kaptur has also requested $10.4 million for defense-related research and development at the Great Lakes Research Center in Ohio. The nonprofit agency was created by executives at Imaging Systems Technology, a company whose owners have donated to Ms. Kaptur's campaigns. Ms. Kaptur has sent $8.4 million in earmarks to the firm since 2008. (A9)</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tired of waiting for spending to rebound on its own, retailers are taking matters into their own hands. Stores like Sam's Club, Target, Toys ''R'' Us, Staples and <span class="companylink">Office Depot</span> are offering unconventional promotions meant not only to attract visitors to stores, but also to get them feeling profligate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam's Club is introducing a program in which it facilitates loans for shoppers of up to $25,000, backed by the Small Business Administration. Target will give its credit card holders 5 percent discounts. Toys ''R'' Us is instituting a holiday fund program where it adds to shoppers' savings, and Staples and <span class="companylink">Office Depot</span> are giving away office products for a penny or at no cost.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the government programs have come to an end,'' said David Bassuk, a managing director in the global retail practice at AlixPartners, a financial consultancy. ''So retailers are taking it upon themselves to do everything they can to get the consumer to spend, even opening up their own wallets to give money back to the consumer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Persistent unemployment nationwide is threatening to inhibit consumer spending. The latest figures from the government on Friday underscored the depth of the problem, with the economy adding only 83,000 private sector jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no relief in sight from Washington, either. Congress left on recess Friday having failed to pass legislation that would have extended unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the small-business side, credit concerns are keeping some companies from spending. And on the consumer side, while spending and confidence numbers continue to be weak, personal income has risen for three months straight and savings rates are relatively high. That suggests people now have cash but are just sitting on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this backdrop of uncertainty, retailers are taking bold steps. Of the over-the-counter stimulus plans, the one at Sam's Club is the most unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam's began testing the program in May and will soon start marketing S.B.A. loans of $5,000 to $25,000 for its members nationwide. Superior Financial Group, which is managing the loans, gives Sam's members a $100 discount on the application fee, and lower interest rates, because of how much business it expects through the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company says it does not expect the program to be a big moneymaker, though it earns $50 for each financed loan. The point is to get customers spending more freely -- and, it hopes, spending at Sam's Club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Golata had been watching his spending carefully. As a contractor in Louisville, Ky., for <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span>, he drives emergency medical equipment to hospitals when M.R.I. or CT scan machines break down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he asked U.P.S. if more routes were available, the company told him there was so much work that he should bring on as many drivers as he could afford. There was just one problem: Mr. Golata owned one truck, and he was driving it all the time. Online, he had found a used white Dodge Sprinter for $12,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just a few thousand dollars in cash, he tried to get a bank loan but was denied by two local banks because the truck was too old and had too much mileage. He decided an S.B.A. loan would be too much trouble, and he rejected as absurd a loan from a commercial finance company with a 21 percent interest rate and payments of $450 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a month ago, Mr. Golata, a Sam's Club member, clicked through the retailer's Web site and found a page describing S.B.A. loans offered by the retailer. He filled out an online application, and, by the next day, got a phone call from Superior Financial telling him he was approved for a $10,000 loan, with an interest rate of 7.25 percent over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It made the payment, like, $118 a month. I thought I was dreaming,'' Mr. Golata said. Mr. Golata immediately bought the Dodge, and hired three drivers. He went from billing U.P.S. $3,000 a week to $8,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little under half of Sam's members are small-business customers, and they account for a little more than half of the revenue at the retailer. As its net sales began to slip last fall, Sam's surveyed small-business customers and found that tight credit was partly to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the survey, said Catherine Corley, vice president for member services at Sam's, a division of <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, ''fully one-third said 'I didn't buy what I needed to buy at Sam's Club because I didn't have the money.' It really motivated us to say, 'We've got to find some solutions.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam's has done only a small test of the S.B.A. loans, and so far about 200 people have applied, with about 45 percent being approved, said Tim Jochner, chief executive and founder of Superior Financial. Sam's is considering offering other financial products through third parties to help ease customers' finances, like working-capital loans or peer-to-peer loans, said Hiren Patel, director for financial services at Sam's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not necessarily trying to be a bank, we're just trying to bring to them, much as we do with products, the things they need,'' Ms. Corley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other retailers are taking slightly different routes to economic recovery. Beginning in the fall, Target will offer its holders of its Target-branded credit and debit cards 5 percent off every purchase. Target expects that it will add a percentage point to comparable-store sales in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toys ''R'' Us is asking consumers to create a sort of grown-up piggy bank, and put money into a holiday fund that can be spent only at the toy store. Toys ''R'' Us will add 3 percent to the account's balance in mid-October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And <span class="companylink">Office Depot</span> is giving away products. Trying to lure back-to-school shoppers, it will soon sell some supplies, like glue sticks and scissors, for less than $1. It also will give away other items, like markers, free, even without a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staples, meanwhile, is offering several products for a nickel or a penny, and when shoppers buy a backpack during the back-to-school period, Staples will give them a gift card equal to the cost of the backpack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On that particular one we probably don't make money, but in general what we're hoping to do is get customers into our stores,'' said Demos Parneros, president of United States stores for Staples, ''and then buy everything else that they need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, smart shoppers can take advantage of these programs without necessarily improving the stores' revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Golata, the truck driver, said he was delighted with the loan program. But if the point of it was to free up his cash at Sam's, it didn't quite work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is saving again -- so he can get another Sam's Club loan in six months and buy another delivery vehicle.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job creation has been disappointing, but first-quarter corporate profits were up 44 percent from a year earlier. Consumers are nervous, but the Dow, which was below 8,000 on the day President Obama was inaugurated, is now over 10,000. In a rational universe, American business would be very happy with Mr. Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no. All the buzz lately is that the Obama administration is ''antibusiness.'' And there are widespread claims that fears about taxes, regulation and budget deficits are holding down business spending and blocking economic recovery.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much truth is there to these claims? None. Business spending is indeed low, but no lower than one would have expected given widespread overcapacity and weak consumer spending. Business leaders are feeling unloved, but giving them a group hug won't cure what ails the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask the Obama-is-scaring-business crowd for some actual evidence supporting their claim, and they'll tell you that business spending on plant and equipment is at its lowest level, as a share of G.D.P., in 40 years. What they don't mention is the fact that business investment always falls sharply when the economy is depressed. After all, why should businesses expand their production capacity when they're not selling enough to use the capacity they already have? And in case you haven't noticed, we still have a deeply depressed economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, there has been a close relationship between the level of business investment and the ''output gap,'' the difference between the economy's actual output and its long-run trend -- which means that there's nothing surprising about low investment now, given the fact that the output gap is hugely negative. If anything, it's surprising how well business investment has been holding up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternatively, we can look directly at measures of unused business capacity. Capacity utilization in industry is up over the past year, but still far below historical norms. Vacancy rates at industrial and retail properties are at historic highs. Again, given that businesses have plenty of idle structures and machines, why should they be building or buying even more?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So where's the evidence that an antibusiness climate is depressing spending? The answer, supposedly, is that this is what you hear when you talk to entrepreneurs. But don't believe it. Yes, when you talk to business people they complain about taxes, regulations and the deficit; they always do. But the Obama's-socialist-policies-are-wrecking-the-economy chorus isn't coming from businesses; it's coming from business lobbyists, which isn't at all the same thing. Read the report on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the latest Washington Monthly: peddling scare stories about what Democrats are up to is a large part of what organizations like the chamber do for a living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or read through the latest survey of small business trends by the National Federation for Independent Business, an advocacy group. The commentary at the front of the report is largely a diatribe against government -- ''Washington is applying leeches and performing blood-letting as a cure'' -- and you might naively imagine that this diatribe reflects what the surveyed businesses said. But while a few businesses declared that the political climate was deterring expansion, they were vastly outnumbered by those citing a poor economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charts at the back of the report, showing trends in business perceptions of their ''most important problem,'' are even more revealing. It turns out that business is less concerned about taxes and regulation than during the 1990s, an era of booming investment. Concerns about poor sales, on the other hand, have surged. The weak economy, not fear about government actions, is what's holding investment down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why are we hearing so much about the alleged harm being inflicted by an antibusiness climate? For the most part it's the same old, same old: lobbyists trying to bully Washington into cutting taxes and dismantling regulations, while extracting bigger fees from their clients along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, business leaders are, as I said, feeling unloved: the financial crisis, health insurance scandals, and the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico have taken a toll on their reputation. Somehow, however, rather than blaming their peers for bad behavior, C.E.O.'s blame Mr. Obama for ''demonizing'' business -- by which they apparently mean speaking frankly about the culpability of the guilty parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, C.E.O.'s are people, too -- but soothing their hurt feelings isn't a priority right now, and it has nothing at all to do with promoting economic recovery. If we want stronger business spending, we need to give businesses a reason to spend. And to do that, the government needs to start doing more, not less, to promote overall economic recovery.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Reserve urged banks and regulators on Monday to help the nation's small businesses get the loans they needed to create jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also acknowledged that economists could not agree on why such lending has contracted substantially over the last two years.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses -- those having fewer than 500 employees -- employ half of all Americans and account for about 60 percent of gross job creation. Federal data indicate that lending to such companies fell to below $670 billion in the first quarter of this year from more than $710 billion in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons are unclear. Many entrepreneurs say that bank loan officers are denying loans to creditworthy borrowers as part of an overreaction to the bad loans of the last economic expansion and heightened scrutiny by regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But several economists paint a more nuanced picture, arguing that weak economic fundamentals and battered balance sheets have lowered the appetite for new lending. They say that demand could take years to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, acknowledged the uncertainty at the start of a daylong forum on small-business lending at the central bank's headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How much of this reduction has been driven by weaker demand for loans from small businesses, how much by a deterioration in the financial condition of small businesses during the economic downturn, and how much by restricted credit availability?'' Mr. Bernanke asked. ''No doubt all three factors have played a role.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a broad outreach effort, the Fed held 43 meetings on the financing needs of small businesses, starting on Feb. 3 in Lexington, Ky., and ending on June 30 in Shreveport, La. Two of the meetings, in Miami and Davenport, Iowa, focused on Hispanic-owned businesses. One, in Denver, was centered on the Small Business Administration's guaranteed-loan programs. At yet another, in Detroit, the challenges facing auto industry suppliers took center stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A collapse in the value of real estate and other collateral used to secure loans posed a ''particularly severe challenge'' to small businesses, Mr. Bernanke said. He recalled that a business owner at the Detroit meeting told him, ''If you thought housing had declined in value, take a look at what equipment is worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some entrepreneurs have resorted to borrowing on their personal credit cards or from their retirement accounts, he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, for their part, say that they have not so much tightened credit as returned to more traditional underwriting standards after being too lax, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But, though some lenders said they were emphasizing cash flow and relying less on collateral values in evaluating creditworthiness,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''it seems clear that some creditworthy businesses -- including some whose collateral has lost value but whose cash flows remain strong -- have had difficulty obtaining the credit that they need to expand, and in some cases, even to continue operating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernanke's cautious diagnosis set the tone for the forum, which included four panel discussions. His view was echoed by two other speakers, Karen G. Mills, the head of the Small Business Administration, and Elizabeth A. Duke, a member of the Fed's board of governors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ambivalent nature of the discussion -- after months of listening and research by the Fed -- prompted expressions of frustration from several of those invited to the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With all due respect for my banking colleagues, there is an apparent disconnect between the proclaimed 'business as usual' and the widespread problems with access to credit reported by small businesses,'' said Shari Berenbach, president of the Calvert Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Bethesda, Md., that makes loans to community development financial institutions that serve poor and working-class areas. Bank representatives maintained that meritorious borrowers were getting loans, and economists agreed that there was not much evidence of a broad refusal to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin P. Watters, chief executive of business banking at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, said the bank was taking a second look at borrowers that initially were denied loans, and was eager to make loans. ''We're really trying to get those healthy borrowers to invest again,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William C. Dunkelberg, an economist in the School of Business and Management at Temple University, said surveys showed that capital spending was at a 35-year low and that companies were still cutting, not adding, inventory. ''Credit's not an issue,'' he said. ''Customers are the issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed was not sure why lending had contracted. He highlighted the particular importance of start-up businesses. Companies less than two years old accounted for roughly a quarter of gross job creation over the last 20 years, even though they employed less than 10 percent of the work force during that time, he said, citing new research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoltan J. Acs, an economist in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University, said that in Japan stagnation had stifled entrepreneurship, and that the United States might be following a similar path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I worry about is, are we on a trajectory where start-ups are not going to recover?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the expiration of stimulus provisions that made Small Business Administration loans more attractive to borrowers and lenders - and with efforts to renew those provisions stalled in Congress - S.B.A.-backed lending all but collapsed in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total approved loans in the S.B.A.'s guaranteed loan programs fell to just $647 million for the month, down two-thirds from $1.9 billion in May, according to figures provided by the agency. It was the worst month for S.B.A. lending in years, perhaps decades. Even during the credit crisis that began in the fall of 2008 the S.B.A. approved more loan dollars than it did last month. (S.B.A. officials were unable to provide figures for the total number of loans approved in the last three months.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers who work with the S.B.A. blamed the steep drop-off on the absence of stimulus measures that raised the guarantee level on general business, or 7(a), loans from 75 percent to 90 percent and also eliminated borrower fees on both 7(a) loans and so-called 504 loans, which are used primarily to finance capital investments such as real property. These provisions largely expired at the end of May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This year we've really been concentrating on S.B.A. loans because the government guarantee is 90 percent. It's good for the customer, and we're protecting the bank as well,'' said Jack Byun, executive vice president of <span class="companylink">First Intercontinental Bank</span>, a community bank serving Atlanta's northeast suburbs. According to industry consultant Coleman Publishing, in the first half of the S.B.A.'s 2010 fiscal year (which began in October 2009), First Intercontinental made nearly $28 million in loans, making it the 45th largest S.B.A. lender by dollar volume. Once the 90 percent guarantee expired, Mr. Byun said, the bank approved ''very few'' loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers, too, were holding back, he added: ''There's a decrease in demand, because the customer has to come up with the guarantee fees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S.B.A. Administrator Karen Mills urged Congress to renew the measures. ''It's important to continue what works,'' Ms. Mills said through a spokeswoman. ''We've been able to put $30 billion in the hands of small businesses and now is not the time to pull back. Despite improvements in the economy, we need to continue providing small businesses the tools they need to grow, create jobs and lead us into recovery.'' Bills that included extensions through the end of the year have passed the House twice but not the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stimulus provisions have expired before, including for a three-week period last December. Lending fell then as well, but not nearly as far as this time. And lending in November 2009 was at its highest point since October 2008, perhaps in part because bankers raced to get loans approved before the stimulus' generous provisions expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers offered several explanations for why the 90 percent guarantee raised lending. Mr. Byun said it allowed his bank to take more risk in lending. ''If there's a 90 percent guarantee, then we are more aggressive to get the loan,'' he said. ''If it's a 75 percent guarantee, we are less aggressive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other lenders said the higher guarantee allows them to make more loans. Brian Carlson, president and chief executive of Beverly Hill-based Excel National Bank, the fourth-largest S.B.A. lender in the first half of 2010, said that bank regulators permit institutions to keep less capital in reserve for loans with higher guarantees. ''Most banks are in a difficult or tight position on capital,'' he said. ''If I make a $1 million loan with a 75 percent guarantee, I need 10 percent of the $250,000 that is not guaranteed, or $25,000, as a capital requirement. If the loan is guaranteed at 90 percent, then I only need $10,000 in capital allocated toward that loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Sloane, chairman and chief executive of Newtek Business Services, a large S.B.A. lender that is not a bank, said that the lower guarantees meant that his company would itself have to borrow more money to make the same amount of loans. (A bank uses its deposits to fund loans; a non-bank lender has to find other sources of capital to lend.) The higher guarantee, he said, ''is key to being able to lever borrowed capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sloane said that since the guarantee fell back to 75 percent, Newtek had not sent a loan to the S.B.A. for official approval. Instead, he said, the company is informally signing off on loans on the assumption that the higher guarantee will return, and will send them to the S.B.A. when it does. ''Our pipeline is at a record number,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sloane said that because loans were typically funded 30 to 60 days after they're approved, ''if this continues, you're likely to see a lot of businesses that don't have funding in September and October.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate has begun debating a small-business jobs bill that includes the higher guarantees and lower fees for S.B.A. loans. A vote could come as early as next week. If it passes, a similar bill would have to also pass the House before the provisions would become law once more.</p>

But these odd-couple relationships can be fraught with peril.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve A. Stone, a veteran product manager at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, had an idea for an innovative way to identify and track digital objects across the Web. So he set up shop for a new company in his garage in suburban Seattle, and convinced a few <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> colleagues to join him. They began building their software, working late many nights, fueled by spaghetti and takeout Subway and Quiznos sandwiches.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up, Infoflows, began working with Corbis, the big photo library and licensing company owned by Bill Gates, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s chairman, and in June 2006, the two signed a multimillion-dollar development agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four months later, things fell apart, culminating in a Washington State jury verdict against Corbis for misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and breach of contract. The jury awarded damages of more than $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Corbis said it was ''disappointed by the outcome in the trial and believes that the trial court made substantial legal errors.'' It plans to appeal and said it was ''confident that it will ultimately prevail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Infoflows-Corbis story is a striking case of a partnership between a start-up and a big company gone bad, and a catalog of pitfalls to avoid -- courtroom battles, millions in legal costs and a business in limbo for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you want is the business equivalent of no-fault divorce,'' said Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''You want the ability to experiment, fail and disengage, and move on, to keep the innovation process moving forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was no amicable split between Infoflows and Corbis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court filings and testimony, Corbis asserted that Infoflows was a poorly performing contractor that Corbis had patiently tried to work with, but finally gave up on. Except for a small sliver of technology belonging to Infoflows, Corbis said, all the work produced and the intellectual property was owned by Corbis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infoflows saw things differently. ''They took our ideas and tried to claim them as their own,'' Mr. Stone said. ''And they tried to crush a little company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Settlement talks a few months ago failed. Mr. Stone and his Infoflows colleagues were willing to be interviewed now because, they say, they want their account of events made public as they try to restart their business. They also say they hope the court ruling in their favor may deter other big companies tempted to bully a start-up, as they say Corbis did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also the case that as a result of the ruling Mr. Gates -- who owns Corbis, but is not a party to the suit -- had to personally put up a bond of more than $20 million for damages assessed. Infoflows will not get a penny of that money until the appeal process concludes, if Infoflows prevails, or a settlement is reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its statement, a lawyer representing Corbis offered an overview of its position, answered specific questions and supplied court documents and testimony, on the condition that he would not be quoted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infoflows may hold the upper hand now, but the long legal battle has taken a toll on the founders, they say. Retirement accounts and savings, they say, have been drained to pay legal fees. Still, unlike many start-ups, the Infoflows founders did have resources to battle the big company. And they had little choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2006, Corbis told Infoflows that it was terminating the contract it signed four months earlier. Mr. Stone said he was stunned but just wanted to move on. When Infoflows put up its public Web site in January 2007, Corbis filed suit, claiming any Infoflows digital content-tracking product would be illegally using Corbis's proprietary technology. Infoflows countersued the same day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infoflows, its founders say, talked to potential customers and venture capital backers. But the litigation with Corbis scared them away. ''No one wanted to come near us,'' recalled Carlo Martin, a former engineer at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>. ''It shut us down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infoflows, which had leased offices in Redmond, Wash., retreated to Mr. Stone's garage. For Mr. Stone, overseeing the legal battle with Corbis was a full-time job, but the other five founders sought outside work, mainly as consultants and contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Infoflows, the Corbis deal was a big bet on one customer. And the start-up went into the partnership without patenting its software or system for tracking digital rights, a further risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology start-ups that work with big companies, said Kevin Rivette, a Silicon Valley consultant, should take care to protect their most valuable ideas, even as they collaborate. ''Innovation without protection is philanthropy,'' said Mr. Rivette, a former vice president of intellectual property strategy for I.B.M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stone said he felt no rush to patent because he wanted the joint work with Corbis to move closer to a finished system. Infoflows, he said, would develop the underlying system for identifying and tracking digital objects across the Web, and Corbis would own the application for its photo-licensing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2006, after Corbis terminated its agreement with Infoflows, Mr. Stone met with Corbis managers to discuss details of the breakup. Corbis said the intellectual property it claimed as its own was covered in the nonpublic patent Corbis had filed back in January of that year. It was the first time Mr. Stone had heard of Corbis patenting the work, he said. ''I was shocked,'' he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corbis patent, Infoflows said, was a move on its ideas. Mr. Stone said he had an oral agreement with Corbis, supported by an e-mail exchange, that neither side would file for patents until their work was well along. Corbis denied any such agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court, a Corbis lawyer and a software designer testified that they had put the patent application together fairly quickly over a weekend. The Infoflows lawyer called this the ''immaculate invention,'' and submitted Infoflows documents intended to show that Corbis had pilfered the start-up's trade secrets. Corbis countered that most of what Infoflows claimed as its inventions was already in the public domain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case included 26,000 pages of documents and 21 depositions. Much of the trial revolved around technical matters of software and business methods. Each point was disputed, as in an interminable he said-she said argument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Corbis asked Infoflows in 2006 to help it gather evidence on a digital pirate, who was taking Corbis-licensed photos and illegally reselling them. Infoflows did, and a Corbis manager sent an e-mail message of thanks. ''First of all, let me just say how friggin awesome you guys are. Seriously, this is HUGE, and you guys ROCK!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In court, Infoflows presented the episode and e-mail message as evidence that its technology indeed worked. Corbis said Infoflows did a good job, but mainly by working long hours and using software made by others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal experts say accusations of misappropriation of trade secrets can be very difficult to prove -- more so than patent infringement -- because such business secrets can be hard to clearly identify and to show as being under legal protection. ''The court must have felt there was a real injustice here,'' observed Mr. Rivette, a former litigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is an issue for the appeals court.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, hundreds of these businesses will join in the announcement of a grass-roots campaign against tax avoidance that has already drawn support from a prominent lawmaker.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign, Business and Investors Against Tax Haven Abuse, is backed by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who in recent years has investigated offshore tax havens and the large companies and wealthy investors that use them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Levin plans to announce the campaign with its supporters, a coalition of three nonprofit groups -- the American Sustainable Business Council, Business for Shared Prosperity and Wealth for the Common Good. They will release a 25-page report that contends that American multinational corporations use havens to avoid $37 billion in federal taxes each year, a figure the groups call conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This $37 billion could be used to fund initiatives to support America's small businesses -- the nation's biggest job creators -- by increasing their access to capital, increasing their opportunities to invest and rewarding entrepreneurship,'' the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that money, the report says, ''we could establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund to provide capital investments to small community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) to increase lending to small enterprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Keener, a spokesman for a coalition member, Business for Shared Prosperity, said on Monday that 400 executives, investors and representatives of businesses had signed a petition in support of the campaign. They included a small shoe company in Maine, a consultancy in Virginia and cleaning services, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is unusual because it is the first time that small businesses have organized to combat offshore tax avoidance and evasion in a significant way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Business and Investors Against Tax Haven Abuse campaign represents the first time in recent years that business people who believe tax havens are bad for business are mobilizing publicly to end the abuse,'' Mr. Levin said Monday in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department estimated in 2009 that the international gap between taxes owed and taxes paid ranged from $43 billion to $123 billion a year for corporations and individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report calls for laws that would block transfers of intellectual property designed to evade taxes; ban shell corporations that earn profits offshore, even when a corporation's management team is based in the United States; repeal a rule that allows American corporations to reduce or eliminate their United States tax bills if 80 percent of their business takes place overseas; and set penalties for government contractors that use tax havens.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Perhaps the last best hope of Democrats to pass legislation aimed at creating jobs before the November elections seemed to be crumbling in the Senate on Wednesday as Republicans signaled that they would block a bill to expand government lending programs and grant an array of tax breaks to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrangling over the small-business measure began in earnest after Senate Democrats, breaking a two-month partisan logjam, finally succeeded in winning an extension of unemployment insurance. The vote was 59 to 39, with two Republicans joining Democrats in support of the extended benefits, which are retroactive to June 1. One Democrat, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, voted against it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the vote, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, turned to the small-business bill, one of the few items left on the Senate's dwindling agenda before the August recess. Indeed, it had been on the floor intermittently over the last several weeks, only to be pulled to make way for other legislation including the extension of unemployment insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with some Democrats viewing the small-business bill as critical to their political prospects in November, Senate Republicans were not about to let it through easily, and have insisted on a chance to offer amendments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a bid to save the bill, Democrats released a new version of it on Wednesday night without a $30 billion lending program. But Mr. Reid immediately introduced an amendment that would restore the fund, and he continued to block any Republican amendments. Democratic aides said talks with the Republicans would continue, and they were still hopeful that some form of the measure would be approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama called on the Senate to approve the bill in a statement in the Rose Garden on Monday. ''We all have to continue our efforts to do everything in our power to spur growth and hiring,'' he said. ''And I hope the Senate acts this week on a package of tax cuts and expanded lending for small businesses, where most of America's jobs are created.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also raised the issue in his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday. The White House said Mr. Obama would continue pushing for the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are the engine of private sector job creation, and the president will fight against any attempts by the partisan minority to block progress on legislation that helps our economic recovery,'' a spokeswoman, Amy Brundage, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana and chairwoman of the small-business committee, who is a main author of the legislation, said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, seemed intent on denying Mr. Obama and the Democrats a chance to pump up the economy ahead of the midterm elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think Senator McConnell knows and believes this bill could actually create millions of jobs and doesn't want to give the president and Democrats credit for doing what we do, which is standing up for the middle class,'' Ms. Landrieu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Democrats don't stand for small business, I don't know what we stand for,'' she added. ''I don't want to go into this election standing for Wall Street and big business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main point of disagreement is the centerpiece of the legislation: a proposed $30 billion lending program that would make credit available to small businesses through local banks. Some Republicans have decried the proposal as a mini ''bailout'' and said they would vote against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most prominent potential Republican supporter of the bill, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and the senior Republican on the small-business committee, said Wednesday that she firmly opposed the $30 billion program because it echoed the huge bailout of Wall Street, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which has become a political liability for lawmakers who supported it even though many economists say it was a success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has all the quality and features of the TARP program,'' Ms. Snowe said in an interview outside the Senate chamber. ''I think we've been down that road.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Ms. Snowe opposed, Democrats were trying to persuade other Republicans, including Senator George LeMieux of Florida, to support the bill but seemed to be coming up short. A senior Republican aide said the bill would be approved only if Democrats dropped the $30 billion plan. In a letter to Mr. Reid and Mr. McConnell, the Independent Community Bankers of America and 29 state community banking associations urged approval of the lending plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is dropped, what would be left is a package of slightly more than $12 billion in tax breaks for small businesses, including provisions that would allow quicker tax write-downs of capital expenditures, known as accelerated depreciation, as well as a break on capital gains taxes from the sale of certain small-business stock if the stock is held for more than five years. Administration officials said a pared bill would still be helpful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would also expand several Small Business Administration loan programs, increasing loan limits and, in some cases, eliminating borrower fees. And it would allow small business to carry back general business tax credits to offset their tax bills from the previous five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell said Mr. Obama and the Democrats had only themselves to blame for the delay in acting on the small-business measure, because they had repeatedly pulled it off the floor and had also denied Republicans an opportunity to offer amendments. ''If the president wants to criticize someone for slowing it down, he should point the finger at his own party for repeatedly taking it off the floor,'' Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extension of unemployment insurance provides benefits through November to millions of Americans who have been out of work for six months or more, ending a politically charged fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $34 billion unemployment measure now heads to the House, where approval as early as Thursday was expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats were harsh in their criticism of Republicans who held up the unemployment money by refusing to vote for it unless some way was found to keep the costs from being added to the deficit.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- At the core of some of the major policy fights in Washington these days is a ferocious competition between Republicans and Democrats over which party is the champion of America's small businesses -- a mantle that each side views as crucial to shaping economic policy and winning the November elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle was on full display on Wednesday as Senate Democrats pushed ahead with efforts to pass a bill that would increase lending to small businesses and provide tax breaks, and President Obama visited the Tastee Sub Shop in Edison, N.J., where he ordered a ''super sub with everything,'' to highlight his party's small-business agenda.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides agree that the nation's 27 million small businesses will be a big factor in the economic recovery. Beyond that, however, the gloves come off, as Democrats say Republicans are stalling the small-business bill and Republicans say that Democrats will strangle small businesses with higher taxes and heavy-handed regulation -- though Mr. Obama, in New Jersey, emphasized that he had cut taxes for small businesses eight times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the sandwich shop, Mr. Obama said there should be no argument. ''Surely, Democrats and Republicans ought to be able to agree on this bill,'' he said. ''Helping small businesses, cutting taxes, making credit available. This is as American as apple pie. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They are central to our identity as a nation. They are going to lead this recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tug of war for the affection of small-business owners was a central issue in the year-long debate over major health care legislation, and it stands to be an even bigger issue in the battle this fall over extending the Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans, with support from the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business, have begun making the case that allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the top two income brackets would harm small-business owners, impede the recovery and perhaps even lead to a double-dip recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats counter that just 3 percent of tax returns in the top two brackets show any business income, meaning that most small-business owners stand to benefit from the Democrats' push to continue the tax cuts for individuals earning less than $200,000 and families earning less than $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the small-business bill itself, which has languished in the Senate for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the midterm elections just three months away, Senate Republican leaders see little reason to hand Mr. Obama another legislative achievement, let alone one that would bolster the Democrats' efforts to debunk the image that the Republican Party has long cultivated as the primary champion of small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats on Tuesday evening introduced yet another version of the legislation aimed at winning over Republican supporters. But the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Democrats should only blame themselves for the delay in passing the bill, noting that it was repeatedly shelved to deal with other issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell also sharply criticized the Democrats' economic policies. ''Spending, debt, regulations, more government -- none of it has worked,'' he said. ''And now they want to raise taxes on the very small businesses that are trying to create jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To counter the Republican opposition, Democrats are turning to groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the independent business federation -- traditionally Republican allies -- in hopes that they will help twist the arms of some Republican senators into voting for the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House has already approved a package similar to the one in the Senate, which would extend and expand tax cuts for small businesses to invest and hire, and create a $30 billion lending program within the Treasury Department, to be administered through community banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a crucial test vote last week, two Senate Republicans, George LeMieux of Florida and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, voted with Democrats in favor of the $30 billion lending program, even as other Republicans denounced it as a mini ''bailout'' that would encourage community banks to make risky loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by that vote, Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana and chairwoman of the small-business committee, continued to make a forceful case for the bill on the Senate floor on Wednesday even as Democratic leaders struggled to resolve procedural disputes with the Republicans that threatened to kill the measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Eighty-one percent of the jobs lost in America were from small business,'' Ms. Landrieu said. ''If we do our job right,'' she added, ''this is the bill that will jump-start, jolt, be a catalyst.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Landrieu met Wednesday morning with a number of advocacy groups who are supporting her bill and urged them to press Republicans to support the measure. The bill's fate seemed likely to be decided in a procedural vote on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats say that the Republicans' reputation as an ally of small business is undeserved, and that advocacy for small businesses is really a way of cloaking efforts to help big, wealthy corporate interests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The American people know one thing: They are the party of big business,'' the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said in an interview. ''All you have to do is look at what they voted against here in the United States Senate. I have nothing against big business, but to think that they are good for small business is a stretch of the imagination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama sought to take the fight out into the country on Wednesday with his visit to the tiny but popular Tastee Sub Shop, which was cleared of customers as counterterrorism agents patrolled its low roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama ordered a six-inch ''super sub'' -- he declared that at nearly 49 he can no longer eat the 12-inch variety -- and sat down at a table with the owner, Dave Thornton, and the owners of three businesses in nearby towns. ''We've weathered the storm well here at Tastee,'' Mr. Thornton told the president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to administration officials the other business owners -- of an Italian restaurant, a paper manufacturer and a home energy services company -- had benefited from lower-cost government loans and tax cuts.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Thursday rejected a bill to aid small businesses with expanded loan programs and tax breaks, in a procedural blockade that underscored how fiercely determined the party's leaders are to deny Democrats any further legislative accomplishments ahead of November's midterm elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure, championed by Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, had the backing of some of the Republican Party's most reliable business allies, including the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business. Several Republican lawmakers also helped write it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Republican leaders filibustered after fighting for days with Democrats over the number of amendments they would be able to offer. A last-ditch offer by Democrats to allow three was refused by the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The majority leader has graciously given us three amendments and what I'm saying is three amendments is not enough; he knows that,'' Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. ''We are not expecting to have an unlimited number of amendments, but three amendments will not suffice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demise of the measure, at least for now, signaled that Democrats would fare no better on other legislation that they had hoped to finish before summer recess begins at the end of next week, including a scaled-back energy bill. The Senate is expected to confirm Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, but that may be its only substantive action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 60 votes needed to advance the legislation, the tally was 58 to 42, with Democrats unanimously in favor and Republicans all opposed. The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, switched his vote to no at the last minute, a parliamentary step that allows him to call for a re-vote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lawmakers said a deal was still possible. Meanwhile, the Senate turned to a bill that would provide $26.1 billion in aid to states to help cover Medicaid costs and prevent teacher layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote on the small-business bill followed several emotional exchanges on the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is the tradition in the United States Senate: majority rules, but you accommodate the rights of the minority,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who is the senior Republican on the small-business committee. ''We're faced with a procedural impasse here because we're being denied the opportunity to offer some amendments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also chastised Democrats as dillydallying on the measure, repeatedly pulling it off the floor to deal with other matters. ''We need to create jobs in America,'' she said. ''This bill has been on the floor for three weeks and three substitutes -- 81 days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Landrieu harshly criticized Mr. McConnell for blocking the measure, and warned that some businesses might fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our businesses have picked up enough weight; they can't handle that weight,'' she said in a floor speech. ''And if we don't give them some help now, today, many of them aren't going to be here -- I want the senator from Kentucky to know -- when we show up in September.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would create a $30 billion lending program within the Treasury Department, to be administered through local banks. It would also provide more than $12 billion in tax breaks, and would expand or enhance existing lending programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three Republican amendments that Democrats seemed open to debating would eliminate a provision in the new health care law requiring businesses to file 1099 forms reporting when they buy more than $600 in goods from other businesses, extend a tax credit for biodiesel fuel and extend a credit for research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans had also wanted amendments on other topics, including the estate tax, nuclear loan guarantees, border security and the expiring Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator George LeMieux, Republican of Florida, who helped draft the bill, said Democrats had taken a bipartisan measure and created a partisan fight over it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This small-business bill should pass, and it should pass with relevant amendments,'' Mr. LeMieux said. ''Before I am a Republican, I am a Floridian and an American, and this bill is good for our country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With tensions running high, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, noted that ''if just one'' Republican had voted with the Democrats -- a pointed reference to Mr. LeMieux -- the bill would move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LeMieux shot back, ''Half the truth is no truth at all.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Indian company with rich American backers is about to raise up to $350 million in a stock offering closely watched by philanthropists around the world, showing that big profits can be made from small helping-hand loans to poor cowherds and basket weavers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, is one of the biggest players in the field known as microfinance, which involves loans, often as small as $20, that banks might consider too tiny and risky to bother with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SKS was set up as what philanthropists call a ''social enterprise'' -- a business based on the concept of doing well by doing good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is no question that the company's 41-year-old Indian-American founder, Vikram Akula, and investors who include prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists will do very well indeed from the I.P.O. Mr. Akula has already privately sold shares worth almost $13 million, and he still holds stock options potentially worth $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether the social good will be as amply rewarded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span> is not the first microlender to go public, and there has long been debate over whether social enterprises should be turned into giant commercial operations. Proponents of commercial microfinancing say the money raised can provide even more loans to the needy than relying only on charitable donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the I.P.O. for SKS, one of the field's biggest stock offerings yet, has caused its own type of controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disputes involve two charitable microfinance organizations that helped Mr. Akula put SKS on its feet and financed it through its early days. It is not clear what will happen with the money those groups will make from the I.P.O.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one of those groups -- five Indian trusts that now hold the assets of Mr. Akula's original nonprofit version of SKS -- two board members resigned in March over his plan to steer funds toward his original nonprofit group rather than granting them to many charitable entities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other nonprofit ensnared in controversy is a Seattle-based group called Unitus, which holds a stake in SKS that will be worth millions after the I.P.O. The group's board shocked the nonprofit community this month by saying that all of the organization's 40-person staff would be laid off and that Unitus would no longer be involved in microfinance activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That stunned donors of Unitus, which was set up a decade ago specifically to support microfinance. As recently as June, a newly hired chief executive at the group had been discussing ambitious new projects with potential supporters, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In charity circles, people wondered about the motives of the Unitus board members, at least four of whom had invested in <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span> themselves and thus would reap profits from the I.P.O.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Unitus is closing down, that shows what is the real result of this I.P.O.,'' said Muhammad Yunus, an economics professor who is considered the father of microfinance and has been critical of the SKS stock offering. ''You are now encouraging the profit-maximizing part, and the nonprofits are closing down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Grenny, the chairman of Unitus's board and an SKS investor, declined to say what would happen to Unitus's proceeds from the offering. Because Unitus is listed as a ''promoter'' of the stock offering, he said he could not comment without violating Indian law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's all speculative at this point, anyway,'' he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grenny said he and the other board members would be donating the proceeds to charities -- although he would not say whether Unitus would be among them. In two of the cases he said, the investments were made through charitable foundations the directors were involved with and the proceeds would go to those foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big Unitus donor is the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic and investment venture of an <span class="companylink">eBay</span> founder, Pierre Omidyar. The Omidyar group's managing partner, Matt Bannick, said he was surprised by the Unitus board's decision to scale back, because he was impressed by its plans for future nonprofit microfinance projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt that not only had Unitus done a tremendous amount of good with that model, but also that it remains highly relevant,'' Mr. Bannick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omidyar Network had been concerned enough about the structure of the Unitus board that last autumn it paid for a study by a management consultant. According to two former Unitus executives, the study concluded that some directors had too many nonprofit and for-profit roles with Unitus -- particularly one, Geoffrey Woolley, who was chairman of the investment fund running Unitus's profit-making investments and was an investor in those funds and in SKS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Woolley resigned from the board last fall, but Mr. Grenny said he would now be brought back to help plan Unitus's future beyond microfinance. Mr. Woolley declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unwinding of Unitus stands in contrast to the way Accion, another nonprofit group that focuses on microfinance, handled a $140 million windfall from the 2007 public offering of the Mexican microlender Compartamos. Accion, which still holds a 9 percent stake in the Compartamos, has used the money to expand its microfinance operations, and its executives and directors had no investments in the operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Unitus board, in the news release announcing its decision to withdraw from microfinance, said the group's remaining assets would directed into ''new early-stage, poverty-focused philanthropic activities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with Unitus's remaining skeletal staff expected to be gone by autumn, and with Mr. Grenny declining to discuss the matter, it is not clear who will manage the group's soon to be sizable financial holdings, or how they will be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The board members aren't full-timers or experts,'' said Timothy Ogden, a philanthropy consultant and editor of the blog, Philanthropy Action. ''I don't know how you avoid wasting the millions of dollars the organization is supposed to get through the I.P.O. and its stake in SKS, if you don't have the staff to make smart choices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In India, there are also questions about how nonprofit assets will be handled after the SKS I.P.O.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SKS's roots lie in a nonprofit microfinance organization, known as SKS Society, that Mr. Akula set up in 1997. To help it grow faster, in 2005 Mr. Akula set up a profit-making offshoot, <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, to attract commercial financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one doubts that the money <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span> raises in the offering will enable it to make even more loans to needy applicants. As of March it had about 6.8 million borrowers, holding $624 million worth of microloans, making SKS among the biggest of the world's 1,800 or so microfinance organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controversy lies in the five trusts that served as the bridge between the original nonprofit SKS Society and <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Akula started the profit-making <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, virtually all of the company was owned by the trusts. Over time, as other investors came in -- including the American firm Sequoia Capital and the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla -- the trusts' stake was diluted to 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trusts still stand to benefit in a big way from the public offering. They are selling shares worth up to $42 million and will continue to own a stake worth as much as $175 million -- collectively making them one of the biggest endowments in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new, supposedly independent board was created last fall to oversee the trusts and the new wealth they will have. But that structure quickly fell apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the board's first meeting in March, two of the handful of directors resigned: Narayan Ramachandran, who previously headed the Indian operations of the investment bank <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, and Anu Aga, a prominent philanthropist and former chairwoman of an Indian industrial company, Thermax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ramachandran and Ms. Aga referred requests for comment to the company. But several people close to the situation said the two had left over differences with Mr. Akula -- who at the time was not a member of the trust board -- about how to spend money from the offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Akula wanted the trusts to support education, health and other programs for borrowers of SKS through the nonprofit SKS Society. The two board members reportedly preferred instead to establish a grant-making institution similar to a private foundation that could funnel that money to other, already established social programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Akula declined to discuss the trusts or other specifics relating to the I.P.O., citing Indian and American securities rules. He and a friend, who is a professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, are the only board members. The company's prospectus says three independent directors are being recruited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khosla, the Silicon Valley investor, said Mr. Akula's approach would measurably help SKS borrowers. Giving grants, he said, would spread the money too thinly to too many groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Akula has become something of a celebrity in India, and some people who know him -- including his ex-wife, Malini Byanna -- said he wanted to continue controlling the trusts and SKS Society because he has political ambitions in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to understand -- every loan is a future vote,'' said Ms. Byanna, a Chicago-based lawyer who has been involved in a long legal battle with Mr. Akula over custody of their son, Tejas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at a news conference in India on Monday, Mr. Akula, who was born in India but grew up in Schenectady, N.Y., and is still an American citizen, denied that he had political ambitions. ''I will continue with SKS until poverty is eradicated in India,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS President Obama and Congress search for ways to jump-start job creation in our stalled economy, their best strategy may be right under their noses -- in the voluminous backlogged files of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the agency, after all, that issues the patents that technology startups and other small businesses need to attract venture capital to pay salaries. Three-fourths of executives at venture capital-backed startups say patents are vital to getting financing, according to the 2008 Berkeley Patent Survey, a national study of patents and entrepreneurship. And startups are responsible for almost all the new jobs created in the United States since 1977, according to a study by the Kauffman Foundation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, since 1992, Congress has diverted more than $750 million in patent fees to other purposes. That has left the patent office itself underfinanced and burdened with a backlog of 1.2 million applications awaiting examination, more than half of which have not had even a first review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To revitalize America's engine of entrepreneurship -- and create as many as 2.5 million jobs in the next three years -- Congress should, first, give the patent office a $1 billion surge to restore it to proper functioning. This would enable the agency to upgrade its outmoded computer systems and hire and train additional examiners to deal with the threefold increase in patent applications over the past 20 years. Congress should also pass pending legislation that would prohibit any more diverting of patent fees and give the office the authority to set its own fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the patent office is back to operating effectively, the backlog of 1.2 million applications should yield, judging from history, roughly 780,000 issued patents, about 137,000 of which would go to small businesses. Then, going forward, the agency could grant an additional 88,000 patents within three years. By 2013, small businesses would have received some 225,000 patents that they could then use to secure financing to build their businesses and hire more workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not every patent creates a job or generates economic value. Some, however, are worth thousands of jobs -- Jack Kilby's 1959 patent for a semiconductor, for example, or Steve Wozniak's 1979 patent for a personal computer. It's impossible to predict how many new jobs or even new industries may lie buried within the patent office's backlog. But according to our analysis of the data in the Berkeley Patent Survey, each issued patent is associated with 3 to 10 new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So our guess is that restoring the patent office to full functionality would create, over the next three years, at least 675,000 and as many as 2.25 million jobs. Assuming a mid-range figure of 1.5 million, the price would be roughly $660 per job -- and that would be 525 times more cost effective than the 2.5 million jobs created by the government's $787 billion stimulus plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To encourage still more entrepreneurship, Congress should also offer small businesses a tax credit of up to $19,000 for every patent they receive, enabling them to recoup half of the average $38,000 in patent office and lawyers' fees spent to obtain a patent. Cost, after all, is the No. 1 deterrent to patent-seeking, the patent survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the average 30,000 patents issued to small businesses each year, a $19,000 innovation tax credit would mean a loss of about $570 million in tax revenue in a year. But if it led to the issuance of even one additional patent per small business, it would create 90,000 to 300,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, fully financing the patent office and creating an innovation tax credit could mean as many as 2.5 million new jobs over three years, and add up to 600,000 more jobs every year thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It only makes sense to help innovative small businesses make their way to the patent office and, once there, find it ready to issue the patents that lead to new jobs.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE modern-day versions of the kindly old doctors and business owners around Stockbridge, Mass., that Norman Rockwell loved to paint are finding that their plans to sell their businesses and retire on the proceeds must be delayed, if not abandoned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Keator, whose family's wealth advisory, the Keator Group, is located one town over, said the primary issue was not the decline in the value of their businesses -- though the values have fallen, like those of most other small businesses -- but banks' hesitation to lend money. In one case, Mr. Keator said, a dentist client found out he would have to retain a 40 percent interest in the practice if he wanted to sell it, because the bank would not lend more than 60 percent of the selling price to a young dentist just out of school.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This situation is being repeated among small businesses, and sowing regret for what could have been: if only they had sold their businesses when they had the chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who wanted to sell their business three years ago are somewhat regretful,'' said Steven H. Goodman, president of the SHG Financial Group. ''But most of the people I know in those situations are working hard to run those businesses and keep them going.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, business owners as varied as doctors, car dealers and manufacturers are having to make tough decisions about how best to realize the fruits of decades of labor. With tough standards for bank financing, sellers may have to find well-heeled buyers or finance a significant part of the deal themselves. Agreeing to be paid back over time is not ideal, particularly for someone who wants, or needs, the money now. But in many cases, sellers do not have a choice: they are sick, they have lost their drive or they do not have children who want to, or could, take over the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the worst things that happens is they take their foot off the gas and the business decreases in value,'' said Barbara Taylor, an owner of Synergy Business Services, a business brokerage in Rogers, Ark., who also contributes to the small-business blog of The New York Times. ''You're not doing yourself any good by hanging on to it if you're not able to run it. It's better to go out and sell it now than end up with an unsellable business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How small-business owners manage this process is going to have a tremendous impact on their ultimate level of wealth. But making the decision may seem less overwhelming if you see it through the lens of the old Wall Street ratings systems: sell, hold or buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SELL The one major advantage of selling a small business now is the tax rate. It is likely to go up -- most advisers are predicting the capital gains rate will rise to 20 percent, from 15 percent, in the next year or so. While the price you get for your business today is probably lower than it was during the boom and lower than it may be in a few years, your after-tax profit could be higher now than if you wait and the tax rate is increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is the business worth? That can be an emotional question. Many business owners do not want to believe, any more than homeowners do, that their companies are worth less now. If anything, the attachment to a higher value for the business may be stronger because of all the time people put into building and running their company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're getting some car dealers saying, 'I will sell and I want X because I could have gotten X four years ago,' '' said Thomas Hayes, who runs an automotive brokerage focused on the Northeast. ''They're not going to get back to the crazy prices of four to five years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One solution for the owner who needs to sell at least part of his business is to use an employee stock ownership plan, said Ed Mooney, senior vice president with the wealth strategist group at BNY Mellon. These plans allow the existing management to borrow money to buy a portion of the business and use those funds to pay the founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're becoming more prevalent because some other forms of financing are not available,'' Mr. Mooney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mooney said it was easier to set up an employee stock ownership plan for businesses with inventory and a long history of sales than for an advisory firm or consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, if the goal is to pass the business on to family members, this is actually a great time. An owner could sell interests in a family limited partnership or a limited liability company and take advantage of the lower value of the business -- and the taxes associated with the sale, Mr. Mooney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOLD What exactly would you do with the money you received from selling the business? If you don't have an immediate need for the cash, this may be an argument for holding on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That transition to having a pile of money and not having the revenue of your company is not an appealing transition right now because of the distrust of Wall Street,'' said Shawn Rubin, a managing director for the wealth management division at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> Smith Barney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he could envision a situation in which someone received $8 million for the business but then had to live on an after-tax annual return in a portfolio of 2 percent, or $160,000, an amount far less than the person was earning running the company. ''Plus, you no longer have all the tax benefit of owning a business,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option for those who want to hold on but not run the business anymore is to pay someone a lot of money to take over the day-to-day operations until the market picks up. The upside is continued income; the downside is the risk. ''But if I've been running the business for 30 years, I'm reasonably confident I can weather this storm,'' said Mr. Goodman of the SHG Financial Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUY Finding a buyer is a challenge, yes. But the bigger challenge is finding one who can get the financing to buy your business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hayes said buyers for car dealerships are now split evenly between existing owners with several dealerships to their name and a proven record of success, and first-time owners who are struggling to find creative ways to finance the acquisitions. Banks are not only shying away from financing dealership purchases, but manufacturers require anyone running a franchise to maintain a certain amount of money in the business, often in excess of $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to come up with that money, many first-time dealers have turned to investors who look at a dealership as just another investment, Mr. Hayes said. ''They're not making any money in the stock market, and they're looking for a better return,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not just true for car dealerships, which have been in a dark period. Ms. Taylor, who works with light manufacturers and construction companies, said the percentage of the company that they needed to hold in a sale had increased three times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Keator said his doctor clients were either retaining big ownership stakes, accepting much lower prices or just not retiring. He described the mentality this way: ''I'll bring in an associate and have him work for some sweat equity and get him financing later.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And maybe then the doctor can realize the value of his years of work.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI, India -- In India, waiting in line is not for the soft-elbowed.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a line becomes necessary -- say, while boarding a plane -- some dutiful citizens will rise and form its initial trunk. Then, when the trunk appears too long to some, it sprouts branches. People create their own lines by standing next to, say, the fourth person in the trunk and hoping that others line up behind them. This process continues until you have a human evergreen tree, a single-file trunk of tender fools with impatient foliage on both sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a feline quality to standing in Indian lines. Certain parts of the man behind you -- you don't know which -- brush against you in a kind of public square spooning, the better to repel cutters. (Women do less touching.) Still, this is no deterrent to cutters. They hover near the line's middle, holding papers, looking lost in a practiced way, then slip in somewhere close to the front. When confronted, their refrain is predictable: ''Oh, I didn't see the line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a churning India, the line has new resilience. Businesses are becoming vigilant about enforcing queues, and a growing middle class, more well-off and less survivalist, is often less eager to cut. In this way, India's experience seems to feed into a tradition of seeing line etiquette as a marker of modernity, of graduating from chaos to order, whims to rules, brutality to gentility, scarcity to abundance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality may be more complicated, though, for in India and elsewhere, the reigning idea of modernity involves not just an evolution into queuing but also an evolution out. As scrums succumb to queues, queues are succumbing to the free market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of the scrum, the queue and the market begins, in most versions, in a Hobbesian state of nature in which the scrum controlled all. People got what they got based on their ability to push and pull, maim and slaughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It required new ideas -- of fairness, equality and the like -- to replace scrums with lines. Internet discussion boards are full of stories about societies that were once terrifying free-for-alls -- that is, until progress, meaning lines, came. The idea has even been printed in the pages of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, in a description of queuing in Hong Kong:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> opened in 1975, customers clumped around the cash registers, shouting orders and waving money over the heads of people in front of them. <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> responded by introducing queue monitors -- young women who channeled customers into orderly lines. Queuing subsequently became a hallmark of Hong Kong's cosmopolitan, middle-class culture. Older residents credit <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> for introducing the queue, a critical element in this social transition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James L. Watson, the Harvard scholar whose research led to the entry, has noted that <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> ''did not, in fact, introduce the queue to Hong Kong.'' But such is the association between globalization and lines in the Hong Kong imagination that the belief stuck, he has written. This line-as-civilization notion is popular among Britons, who sometimes boast that they invented lines. This year, their government announced plans to make aspirants for citizenship answer questions about ''the revered British practice of forming an orderly line for everything from buses to sandwiches,'' as The Daily Telegraph put it. But the line not only speaks of civilization. It also stands for dysfunction: dole lines in recessions and depressions; lines in the Soviet Union to buy basics like meat and toilet paper; lines to get driver's licenses worldwide; lines to register complaints; lines in which slum-dwelling women wait to defecate behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with such lines, humans tend to imagine progress as an escape from linear waiting. As a <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> advertisement put it many years ago, ''Waiting is frustrating, demoralizing, agonizing, aggravating, annoying, time consuming and incredibly expensive.'' Contained in that last word is a hint of <span class="companylink">FedEx</span>'s -- and the modern world's -- solution: the free market. Why wait? Just pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Russian malls rise on the ground where Soviet lines once wound; the more affluent villagers in developing countries buy key-locked portable toilets to avoid the morning queue; governments issue ''rush'' visas so that business travelers can jump the line for a few hundred extra dollars. The line-jumping once reserved for the world's commissars is now a middle-class commodity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see it here in India. Even as it moves toward more orderly lines in some spheres, the line is under attack in others, challenged by the market. The famous Hindu temple in Tirupati, in southern India, now has a regular idol-viewing tour and a V.I.P. one, for those who pay. Even as new nightclubs bring rope-line culture to India, many also sell premium memberships that let you skip the line and walk in. As with lines over scrums, markets have much to offer over lines. They are more efficient. They work well for those fortunate enough to have more disposable money than free time. They mop up much of the daily agony of waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market also changes a culture. A line conceives of people as citizens, presumed equal, each with an identical 24 hours a day to spread among the lines around them. A market conceives of people as consumers, presumed unequal, with those who can pay in front of the others. It allocates efficiently, but it eliminates a feature of line culture: the idea that, in line at least, we are no better than anybody else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a way, the market's spread is a return to another kind of scrum, one in which financial, and not physical, might means right. Perhaps one day lines will be remembered as antique, a quaint system in which things were granted simply for having shown up early, an interlude of relative equality between the scrums that reigned before and after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 15, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the emergence of the queue in India overstated what was known about the nationalities of the people shown in line. While the they were gathered outside a hospital in India, they were not necessarily Indians.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S a recipe for a role model: economic anxiety and America's inherent optimism. Enter that paragon of self-reliance, the entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are the president of a very important company -- You Inc.,'' said Thomas J. O'Malia, director of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Southern California. ''And that's true regardless of whether you are starting your own business or working inside a large organization.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurial ideal has been in ascent for years. But the shaky economy, it seems, is making the mystique of the entrepreneur a meme of the moment as never before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is the rise of the entrepreneurial role model just the latest self-help fad? Or is there real substance to the concept of entrepreneurship? Can it be studied and learned?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There seems to be no shortage of effort. Courses in entrepreneurship are now offered by more than 1,200 American universities, and by thousands more organizations including community colleges, small-business development centers and chambers of commerce. Many of the courses are continuing education programs for people with job experience. They include one-week courses, night classes, online offerings and graduate degree programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The courses vary widely, but they typically seek to leave students with some blend of two things: an entrepreneurial mind-set and a tool kit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a start-up or inside a big company, the entrepreneurial approach emphasizes the pursuit of opportunities with small teams and few dollars, quickly and flexibly. The mentality, experts say, is that of the insurgent ''attacker'' rather than the established ''defender.'' Look first to customer needs -- solving some problem and getting paid for it -- to build a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And keep the F-word in mind -- focus,'' advised William K. Aulet, managing director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Entrepreneurship Center. ''The No. 1 reason new businesses fail is lack of focus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One course the M.I.T. center offers is an intensive, one-week entrepreneurship development program that costs more than $8,000 (companies and governments often pay some or all of the costs for their managers).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see that the essence of the entrepreneurial spirit isn't so much about money as it is about passion,'' said Tetsuya O'Hara, 47, who took the M.I.T. course last December. ''It's a perspective that goes beyond business, forcing you to think about what matters most to you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. O'Hara, director of advanced research and development at Patagonia, the outdoor clothing maker, said he had applied the program's thinking in his job, which involves working with outside companies to explore new technologies and business concepts. Before the entrepreneurship program, he had a list of almost 200 projects he might pursue. Today, he has winnowed that list to two priority projects. ''I already got a lot of return from the course,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another participant, J. Patrick Bewley, vice president of global marketing strategy at <span class="companylink">Acxiom</span>, a consumer data marketer, said one insight he took from the program was the importance of assembling strong teams of people with open minds, willing to experiment, learn rapidly and constantly refine ideas to improve them. ''You have to build that culture of resilience within your group,'' said Mr. Bewley, 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both opportunity and necessity are motivations for starting new businesses. A report in May, based on data from the Census Bureau, found that new businesses were formed in 2009 at the highest level in 14 years, despite the weak economy. At the least, challenging economic times can prompt people to rethink their options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what happened to Saudia Davis, a former movie publicist, who worked promoting independent films like ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding.'' She lost her job in 2007, when her employer cut her department. ''I could find a new job or gamble and put everything on the table to start my own business,'' recalled Ms. Davis, 32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She chose to take the entrepreneurial plunge. Her grandmother had been a house cleaner, and Ms. Davis had long thought that house cleaning could be made more healthy and environmentally friendly for the clients and the cleaners. Her company, Greenhouse Eco-Cleaning, in Brooklyn, was founded to pursue that vision of cleaner cleaning. It uses no toxic cleaning agents like ammonia or formaldehyde, and checks the allergies of clients and their pets to avoid using materials that might aggravate those conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Davis had never started a business before, and her work experience in movie promotion and her education, as an English and Africana studies major at Bowdoin College, were scant preparation. She found a business-building course called FastTrac, offered by a nonprofit economic development organization in New York, the Industrial and Technology Assistance Corporation. She took the 12-week course of evening sessions in 2008, with a development grant paying for half the $1,000 tuition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The course work, Ms. Davis recalled, covered business functions like accounting, operations and marketing. ''But it also gave me an understanding of what it takes and how all the slices of the pie that go into making a business come together,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, her company employs 12 people and has 600 household and office clients. Initial plans to manufacture green cleaning products have been postponed -- too capital-intensive and distracting, Ms. Davis said. One lesson learned, she adds, is that the entrepreneurial journey is all-consuming. ''The closest thing I have to vacation is sleep,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FastTrac coursework is developed by the Kauffman Foundation, a philanthropy with $2 billion in assets, dedicated to entrepreneurship research and education. The FastTrac courses are offered in 37 states, by local development organizations, chambers of commerce and other groups. The courses range in cost from $700 to $1,500 depending on the course, teaching venue and the audience, though grants and scholarships are often available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kaplan, the private education company, announced in July that it would begin offering some FastTrac courses online, for $882 a course. And the Kauffman Foundation earlier this month overhauled its free Web site, www.entrepreneurship.org[http://www.entrepreneurship.org], with resources for aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurial mindset, says Bo Fishback, the Kauffman Foundation's vice president of entrepreneurship, is a personal asset that can be applied to any field. ''It's a mentality that sees every problem out there not as a setback but as an opportunity to fix,'' he said. ''Some people will start businesses, but others will take that mindset with them into corporations and government.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It worked out that way for Carrie Coker Britt. After three years working for an Atlanta law firm as a recruiter and administrator, Ms. Britt decided against going to law school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Ms. Britt attended Georgia Tech's business school, and joined a program that puts doctoral science students, law school and business school students in teams to work on start-up projects. The goal of the program is to teach people from different disciplines to work together to accelerate the entrepreneurial process in high-tech start-ups. One team project she worked on won a competition at Georgia Tech and a $10,000 prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today Ms. Britt, 32, works as a software sales representative for I.B.M., covering thousands of accounts in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi. Her job, she says, requires quickly researching industries and figuring out how I.B.M. technology can help individual businesses. ''It's very entrepreneurial, fast-paced, and you're constantly looking for new and better ways to be successful,'' Ms. Britt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, she adds, there is another benefit to having gone through the entrepreneurial program, Ti:ger, for Technological Innovation: Generating Economic Results. ''It was critical to getting the job I have now,'' Ms. Britt said. ''It differentiated me from other candidates.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS a small-business owner, you may feel isolated. Without a large organization's resources, you may long for a sounding board for your frustrations and fears or a discreet, impartial adviser with whom to discuss the tactical and strategic challenges of running a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mentors like teachers, coaches, colleagues and friends may have helped guide you through various life stages, but your existing counselors may lack the skills or knowledge to assist with your current venture. Whether you need consultation from a seasoned executive or commiseration from a peer, there are strategies you can use to build the strongest, most effective mentoring relationships. Here are some suggestions based on the experiences of small-business owners and mentoring professionals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASSESS YOUR NEEDS Rigorous self-assessment should precede your search for a mentor. ''You should understand your values, passions and motivation before asking someone to invest in you,'' said Richard Caruso, who left a finance career in 1989 to found <span class="companylink">Integra LifeSciences</span>, a regenerative medicine company in Plainsboro, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You need to consider your strengths, weaknesses and management style to know what types of mentors will be useful. Are you looking for someone with functional or industry expertise to help with an immediate business issue? Or would you benefit from an outsider's perspective? Do you need a senior adviser or a peer? Short- or long-term relationships? Group mentoring or one-on-one interaction? Answering these questions will help narrow your search. You might consider industry and trade groups, alumni or entrepreneurs' organizations, government-run small-business development centers or online communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Female and minority entrepreneurs often find it beneficial to enlist advisers of like gender or race. Dee Elliott, vice president at King Relocation Services in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., who also owns the travel Web site YouGottaGoTravel, said female mentors empathize with problems of work-life balance and business etiquette. ''Women have to be professional, yet remain open,'' she said. ''We have to be more careful about how we're perceived.'' In 2003, Ms. Elliott founded the mentoring program at the Orange County, Calif., chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSIDER CHEMISTRY If the mix of personalities is not right, find someone new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lena West, founder of xynoMedia, a social media strategy and development firm in Yonkers, met with several advisers before she found the right fit. ''Some mentors want to live vicariously through you or always want you to do things their way,'' she said. ''Don't get discouraged if a mentor doesn't work out. Just have a clear goal, accept the misfire and move on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GO VIRTUAL Traditionally, mentoring has been a face-to-face affair, but Web-based businesses have been using social networking tools to connect small-business people with counselors across the globe. Distance mentoring can give you access to people you otherwise may never ''meet'' and permits you to search for the specific characteristics you desire in a mentor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Druckenmiller Jr., co-founder of TheOpenSea.com, an online community of boaters and marine professionals, sought counsel on PartnerUp, a Web site that matches entrepreneurs with associates and business services, when he needed guidance on his start-up. ''Using the Internet allowed me to gather unbiased opinions from other small-business owners quickly,'' he said. ''It was the most efficient way to get advice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Jones, program director of MicroMentor, said his site worked like ''Match.com for entrepreneurs,'' aiming at underserved small-business owners like women and minorities. Subscribers create profiles and seek relationships with peers or senior mentors on the site. While participants use the Internet to make connections, once comfortable, partners exchange contact information and communicate by phone, by e-mail or in person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to try the Internet but are unsure which site is right for you, go first to Buzgate.org, where visitors can hunt for reputable organizations based on their needs and location. This aggregator site provides explanations for and direct links to associations like Score, Women's Business Centers and economic development agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAKE CHARGE A mentor used to be a judicious elder who imparted wisdom at leisure to a promising upstart. Now mentees are expected to steer the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be candid about goals and expectations. Establish protocols for when and how often to meet and how best to communicate. Prepare questions and think through options before broaching topics. Successful mentoring relationships have both structure and accountability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many affiliations persist past their agreed-upon timeframe, but each party should assess the value of the bond periodically. Both mentor and protege should benefit and remain engaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAKE RULES Encourage honesty and build trust -- through contracts, if necessary. Trust is essential, so avoid counselors with conflicts of interest, like competing businesses. ''As a new entrepreneur, you realize quickly that everyone has ulterior motives,'' said Alan Marnett, who established BenchFly.com, a career-development site for scientists, with help from mentors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Venture Mentoring Service, which guides the university's constituents. The service requires mentors to sign confidentiality agreements and pledge not to invest in businesses led by mentees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choose only the most prudent, tactful advisers. ''It's extremely important to protect information, whether it's about a new product or challenges an entrepreneur is having in his family -- the whole pillow-talk aspect,'' said Brian Costanzo, senior vice president of global membership at Entrepreneurs' Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because trust is harder to build online, Web sites like PartnerUp and MicroMentor encourage users to rate mentors' acumen and reliability. Still, warns David Hemler, senior vice president of small-business services at the <span class="companylink">Deluxe Corporation</span>, PartnerUp's parent company, everyone should do due diligence and ''be cautious sharing proprietary information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEK LOTS OF OPINIONS Do not expect one mentor to cover everything. Cultivate multiple mentors for your personal and professional development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One person is not a guru,'' said Sherwin Greenblatt, director of M.I.T.'s mentoring service, which provides entrepreneurs with up to four advisers who work together. ''With a team you get quality control of ideas and there's a social aspect. Everyone is learning from the others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balance your instincts with others' opinions. Entrepreneurs often receive conflicting advice: ''trust your gut'' versus ''be open to advice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disagreements with mentors are inevitable. ''Your gut feelings can be strong, especially when there's a niche you understand better than anyone else. But the more significant the decision, the more I incorporate my mentors' advice,'' Mr. Marnett said. ''If you keep rejecting your mentors, they're going to lose interest.'' You need not follow all recommendations, but if you're routinely disregarding an adviser, it may be time to part ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mentors can also help highlight obstacles or weaknesses you're avoiding or cannot see. Shannon Cassidy, executive director of Bridge Between, a Philadelphia-based executive coaching firm, cited a diffident protege who preferred not to attract attention with clothes or make-up. Her mentor encouraged her to revamp her image and took her shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This woman's entire brand changed,'' Ms. Cassidy said. ''She had more confidence. It takes creativity on the mentor's part and openness from the mentee. Sometimes it's helping someone create a business plan and sometimes it's helping her pick out a scarf. The relationship can extend into any area of life.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margo Strotter considered herself proof that the revival of Bronzeville was under way. She opened a sandwich and smoothie bar at 45th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue in early 2006 and waited for other businesses, inspired by a booming real estate market, to follow her lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years later, she and Nicole Jones, owner of the designer shoe store next door, are still waiting. No new stores have opened among the empty lots on their street corner since 2008, when development was stalled by the credit crisis and the city's failed Olympics bid.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Strotter and Ms. Jones -- along with the owners of a jewelry boutique, a coffee house and a menswear store -- are among the commercial pioneers who tried to cash in on the buzz surrounding the South Side neighborhood that was once blighted by high-rise housing projects. Now their ventures are a cautionary tale: They are struggling to stay open and instill a sense of community on a street that is quiet during the day and has little sign of night life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bronzeville is one of many West Side and South Side areas that lured developers eager to take risks at the height of the national real estate boom. Revitalization of the South Loop was well under way by 2004 and attracted new restaurants, condominiums, coffee shops and a Target store. Speculators began looking at the depressed land prices in neighborhoods from North Lawndale east to South Shore and north to Edgewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The boom petered out before everybody could make realistic investments,'' said Garth Taylor, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Chicago Information Center. ''The risks became unreasonable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago developers, Mr. Taylor said, ''would rather force another 50,000 square feet of unwanted retail in the middle of Lincoln Park.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Strotter is one of a dozen black entrepreneurs since 2003 who have started businesses on the south end of the Cottage Grove Corridor. Their vision was to recreate the ''Black Metropolis'' of the 1950s, when Bronzeville was a bustling center of Chicago's black middle class and a renowned night-life destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything was here, the butcher, the baker,'' Ms. Strotter said. ''After church, you might go to the skating rink, the theater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That legacy, plus the area's location near downtown and the lake -- and its desirable housing stock -- were among the reasons the entrepreneurs decided to locate there. Ms. Trotter was also encouraged by a local community development group started by Alderman Toni Preckwinkle (4th Ward).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a booming real estate market and Grand Boulevard's crime rates falling after demolition of Chicago Housing Authority high-rises, the commercial possibilities were promising: a sports bar, a fitness club, a shopping mall, a supermarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers spread their blueprints across the tables of Ms. Strotter's cafe -- the only sit-down restaurant for blocks -- to map their plans for Bronzeville's transformation. They were interested in the empty lot across the street and another one two blocks south. They promised they would be back, but they have been slow to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vacant lots were on the verge of being developed and were going to be worth millions of dollars,'' said Steven Rogers, director of the Levy Institute for Entrepreneurial Practice at Northwestern University. ''Now they won't be developed for the next three years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The juxtaposition of boarded buildings and new condominiums in the far North Side Edgewater community and the South Side's South Shore tell a similar story of boom and bust, Mr. Rogers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the financial crisis neared, developers were willing to make financial bets on former West Side and South Side slums, Mr. Taylor said. The risks were highest in the areas where public housing projects had been razed, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those hoping to cash in on the projected influx of condominium buyers are now stranded with no clear consumer base -- though there are some higher-income-earning professionals, the neighborhood's residents also include former public housing residents, students, and the elderly .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelby Thomas still saw potential in 2009 when he opened a day spa. He even viewed the quiet streets as a positive quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas, who previously worked at upscale spas on Michigan Avenue, has yet to turn a profit since he began offering facials, massages, waxing and accupressure to clients who come mainly from the suburbs. To cut costs, in May he began living in the spa, which is in a spacious loft that was built in 2008, and he drew up a budget that did not include cooking gas or air conditioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I unplug everything,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I don't cook.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a neighborhood where the more affluent residents are accustomed to driving north to the Loop's shopping districts to buy luxury items, survival also depends on cross-promotion. Mr. Thomas encourages his clients to visit Faie's African Art Gallery next door, where paintings and sculptures can sell for several thousand dollars, or Fort Smith's Gift Shop, where the store's namesake sells his custom-made jewelry. Business owners say the sense of a shared project -- creating a retail district without the help of big-box chains or wealthy developers -- is what holds them together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit Quad Communities Development Corporation, founded by Ms. Preckwinkle, offers incentives to attract small businesses to the neighborhood, including marketing and consulting, and helps them find real estate agents, grants and loans. The organization is also negotiating with commercial developers to create a 60,000-square-foot retail plaza on 47th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, which would include office and rental units, was postponed when the condominium market collapsed. One of the developers, the Skilken Corporation, secured financing earlier this year, and construction is slated to begin by the end of 2011, said Frank Petruziello, a principal with Skilken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago Housing Authority is planning a mixed-use housing project four blocks north of 47th Street on Cottage Grove Avenue on the former site of the Washington Park Homes, but ground-breaking is still years away and financing for the project is uncertain, said Matthew Aguilar, a spokesman for the housing authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those development prospects, and the general spirit of community building, have not been enough to keep everyone in the Cottage Grove commercial district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending three years on 44th Street and Cottage Grove, Cory Gilkey, the owner of the trendy clothing store Leaders, gave up. Worried about crime and disillusioned by the trash-strewn vacant lots, boarded-up buildings and other remnants of blight on his block, Mr. Gilkey moved in January 2009 to North Wells Street with its better foot traffic for ''peace of mind,'' he said. He also opened another store in Wicker Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got burglarized a few times, and the police said it was because we were an expensive store,'' Mr. Gilkey said. ''I have clients from England, Japan and Germany, and we would be concerned about their safety.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all the visions for Bronzeville's comeback were not enough to keep him there, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were promised there would be a total shopping metropolis,'' Mr. Gilkey said, ''but in my three years, I never saw anything done. We couldn't get inspired by anything down there.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEMPE, Ariz. -- Benjamin Pearcy, a candidate for statewide office in Arizona, lists his campaign office as a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>. The small business he refers to in his campaign statement is him strumming his guitar on the street. The internal debate he is having in advance of his coming televised debate is whether he ought to gel his hair into his trademark faux Mohawk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pearcy, 20, is running for a seat on the Arizona Corporation Commission, which oversees public utilities, railroad safety and securities regulation. Although Mr. Pearcy says he is taking his first run for public office seriously, the political establishment here views him as nothing more than a political dirty trick.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pearcy and other drifters and homeless people were recruited onto the Green Party ballot by a Republican political operative who freely admits that their candidacies may siphon some support from the Democrats. Arizona's Democratic Party has filed a formal complaint with local, state and federal prosecutors in an effort to have the candidates removed from the ballot, and the Green Party has urged its supporters to steer clear of the rogue candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are people who are not serious and who were recruited as part of a cynical manipulation of the process,'' said Paul Eckstein, a lawyer representing the Democrats. ''They don't know Green from red.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Steve May, the Republican operative who signed up some of the candidates along Mill Avenue, a bohemian commercial strip next to Arizona State University, insists that a real political movement has been stirred up that has nothing to do with subterfuge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Did I recruit candidates? Yes,'' said Mr. May, who is himself a candidate for the State Legislature, on the Republican ticket. ''Are they fake candidates? No way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make his point, Mr. May went by <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, the gathering spot of the Mill Rats, as the frequenters of Mill Avenue are known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are you fake, Benjamin?'' he yelled out to Mr. Pearcy, who cried out ''No,'' with an expletive attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are you fake, Thomas?'' Mr. May shouted in the direction of Thomas Meadows, 27, a tarot card reader with less than a dollar to his name who is running for state treasurer. He similarly disagreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are you fake, Grandpa?'' he said to Anthony Goshorn, 53, a candidate for the State Senate whose bushy white beard and paternal manner have earned him that nickname on the streets. ''I'm real,'' he replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gathered around was a motley crew of people who were down on their luck, including a one-armed pregnant woman named Roxie whom Mr. May befriended sometime back and who introduced him to the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democratic Party is fuming over Mr. May's tactics and those of at least two other Republicans who helped recruit candidates to the Green Party, which does not have the resources to put candidates on ballots around the state and thus creates the opportunity for write-in contenders like the Mill Rats to easily win primaries and get their names on the ballot for November. Complaints about spurious candidates have cropped up often before, though never involving an entire roster of candidates drawn from a group of street people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's unbelievable. It's not right. It's deceitful,'' said Jackie Thrasher, a former Democratic legislator in northwest Phoenix who lost re-election in 2008 after a Green Party candidate with possible links to the Republicans joined the race. ''If these candidates were interested in the democratic process, they should connect with the party they are interested in. What's happening here just doesn't wash. It doesn't pass the smell test.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona, where Democrats, Republicans and independents each represent about a third of the populace, is known for its political hardball. Challenging nominating petitions is common. Election-related lawsuits are filed with regularity. This is not the first election in which a party has accused another of putting forth candidates to hoodwink voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the Mill Rat candidates, the Democrats smell a rat in other races, including one in which a roommate of a Republican legislator's daughter ran as a Green Party candidate in a competitive contest for the State Senate. They cite a variety of state and federal election laws that the Republicans may have violated in putting forward ''sham'' candidates for the Green Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view, though, is different along Mill Avenue, where the first-time candidates appear to have been emboldened by the exercise, as Mr. Pearcy's street corner campaign speech last Thursday night attests. Dressed up spiffily, he described himself as the illegitimate son of a stripper who had had run-ins with the law and a tough childhood but who had pulled his life together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been homeless,'' he said, his eyes darting back and forth. ''I got a place. Anyone can do it. We're all good enough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was nodding all around, more than when he went into his pitch to solve the budget deficit through the installation of solar panels. As Mr. Pearcy went on, Mr. May whispered ''focus, focus, focus'' into his ear to get him back on track and help prepare him for a debate in early October, which will be televised across the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reading tarot cards has taught Mr. Meadows, who is known for his purple and green jester hat, to talk a good game. ''This is not the land of the free,'' he told the loungers on the sidewalk, pitching himself for treasurer. ''It's the land of what's for sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grandpa, widely known in the area through the pedicab he drives for hire, is against higher taxes and for God in the classroom. The other night, he was supposed to debate his Democratic and Republican rivals in the race but after seeing only the Democrat on stage, he decided to watch from the back. ''I got a bad vibe,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. May, who served as a Republican legislator from 1998 to 2002, said, ''Even if I wanted to control these guys, they're uncontrollable.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City agencies handed out more than $5.3 billion in contracts between July and December 2009, but only $87 million, or 1.6 percent, went to businesses owned by women and minority candidates, the report says. Fifteen agencies met none of their contracting goals for this period. The number of contracts secured by such businesses continues to be less than half the mandated number.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report's findings, which were based on data published [pdf] by the Department of Small Business Services in April, present the latest challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ability to promote racial and gender diversity within his administration, and his efforts to empower minority-run businesses throughout the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not doing anywhere near enough to create opportunities for women and minorities,'' said Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn, who, along with Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, also of Brooklyn, prepared the report. ''We have a long way to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council passed a law aimed at increasing the ability [pdf] of minority- and women-owned businesses to compete for city contracts in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law applies only to contracts of less than $1 million and sets goals of 25 to 35 percent of such contracts going to women and minority candidates. According to the report, only 12.5 percent of contracts under $1 million went to such candidates during the period studied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law established contracting goals for each city agency and left the Department of Small Business Services to oversee the program. Unlike a quota, a goal is not legally binding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Departments of Sanitation, Parks and Recreation, Transportation, and Environmental Protection, which award some of the city's most lucrative contracts, each failed to fulfill a single contracting goal, the report said. While the city set 368 contracting goals across 35 agencies, it met only 49 of them, or 13 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the mayor, said in an e-mail: ''We'll review the report, but on first glance there seem to be some major flaws with it. We have a long way to go, but the city's efforts to expand the Minority- Women-owned Business Enterprise program have led to unprecedented gains, including contract awards of more than $1.3 billion over the last four years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials noted that the numbers the councilmen analyzed did not include subcontracts, where the city says it has done better. And for many city contracts, the bidding process is sealed, making it impossible for city agencies to know who the bidders are before awarding the contracts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He fumes at strangers who call him a traitor for agreeing to manufacture in Zhuzhou, China, a new solar panel production device that his company developed in the United States.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love my country,'' said Mr. Provini, chief executive of 10-employee Natcore Technology in Red Bank, N.J. ''It makes me crazy that I've got countries that want to do things with us, but not here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Provini acknowledges that further refinements are needed to the technology, which involves replacing a costly furnace in the manufacture of solar panels with a room-temperature process. But his experience in trying to commercialize it highlights the challenges that clean energy entrepreneurs face in the United States -- and the opportunities that await in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American venture capitalists are the main source of money for many clean energy start-ups because most commercial banks are leery of lending to businesses with no proven revenue. But venture capitalists are reluctant to make long-term financial commitments, Mr. Provini said, and want clear timetables for when they can get their money back with a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They want to come in, make a killing and get out,'' said Mr. Provini, who spent most of his career on Wall Street, including as president of <span class="companylink">Ladenburg Thalmann</span> Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he spoke with a Congressional aide and visited a Washington law firm, <span class="companylink">Baker Botts</span>, seeking advice on government assistance. But available grants came with too many restrictions, and were hard to find and apply for, Mr. Provini said. What Natcore really wanted was money for its own research and help finding joint-venture partners with the right technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in Brazil, Taiwan and particularly China were more interested, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Andrew Barron, a Natcore co-founder who developed much of the technology as a professor at Rice University, spent two months at the University of Wales a year ago. There, Bin Chen, a research fellow from Zhuzhou, spoke to him during a shared car ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Chen called his father back home, who put him touch with He Jianbo, the deputy director of Zhuzhou's development zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. He quickly invited Mr. Provini to Zhuzhou, rented him a hotel room, lined up local partners and put together a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natcore owns 55 percent of the joint venture and licenses the technology for sale in China only, while putting up only 15 percent of the money for the venture, which has a tax exemption for at least three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel what China is doing is taking chances on new technologies, investing relatively small amounts of money understanding that some of those technologies will blossom,'' Mr. Provini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Rogers, an adviser to the United States energy secretary, said his department had many grants available of all sizes, and that the competitions for them effectively identified companies that investors might also want to finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the best technology,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''I think we have the best manufacturing here in the United States.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many Chinese clean energy executives are skeptical, saying that the United States was losing its lead even in the production of the sophisticated factory equipment needed to make solar panels, and now retained an advantage only in the earliest stages of research.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEY are not exactly a New York Six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fashion always loves a moment, and none has captivated the industry quite so thoroughly in recent times as the ever-booming population of impressive young designers who have staked their flags proudly in Manhattan. Not a decade ago, the captains of industry were asking themselves who could revive American fashion in the eyes of the world, since the big guns of New York had grown stale, retired or expired, and Paris reclaimed the mantle as the place to be. A Paris Six emerged, as Cathy Horyn, fashion critic for The New York Times, noted in 2005, citing a small group of designers who held the most profound influence over global fashion at the moment, comparable to the Antwerp Six of the early 1990s, or the Japanese designers who dominated Paris in the two decades prior.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is most exciting about what is happening in fashion now, however, is that it is not just six names who are making waves in New York, but an entire generation of designers who have the potential to transform what we think of as American fashion. The majority of designers showing during New York Fashion Week, which begins today, started their labels within the last decade, chasing the dream of fashion in a city that has not always been so hospitable to talented designers. In fact, very few who started here since the 1980s managed to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are more new designers working in New York fashion than at any point in its history, a rush of tenderfeet that one can say with some certainty began in 2002, when Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, two students at Parsons the New School for Design, sold their senior collection to Barneys New York and became the toast of the industry with their label, Proenza Schouler. Their example changed the way young designers looked at their careers. They no longer had to apprentice for years or scream to be heard -- New York was crazy for the new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The savviest among them have created businesses that have eclipsed their predecessors in both scale and speed. Alexander Wang, who started his street-meets-couture collection in 2007, reached $25 million in sales last year; Phillip Lim, his contemporary, has flagships in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Seoul. Their generation, which grew up with the Internet and the ease of access to information, is keenly aware of the power of fashion today in popular culture. They are also incredibly well connected, having formed a mutual support network through the many new initiatives designed to promote designers in New York, and uniquely suited to the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I suppose this is the first generation that has had access to everything in the palm of their hand,'' said Simon Collins, the dean of the school of fashion at Parsons. ''They can find factories on their phones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the new designers are a handful who have shown the greatest potential, six of whom The New York Times invited to a round-table discussion about their generation, their designs, their business strategies and their futures. Joseph Altuzarra started his sharp women's collection after working at Givenchy in Paris. Sophie Theallet, who worked for years in Paris before coming here, is the latest winner of a grant from the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue magazine. Alexa Adams and Flora Gill, of Ohne Titel, bonded while working for Karl Lagerfeld and found their work complementary. (Ms. Gill was traveling and unable to attend.) Wayne Lee, whose label is Wayne, got her start as a buyer at Barneys. Max Osterweis, of Suno, happened on a great idea while he was traveling in Kenya -- to build a collection that celebrated its textiles and helped revive a garment industry there. Patrik Ervell began making men's wear after working at magazines like V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows is a transcript of that conversation, edited for space and clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you feel that you are part of something that is happening right now? Do you sense this shift taking place in fashion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: I would say I do. Especially when I was in school, you just had these huge labels, like bigger older labels, and there was an expectation that you were going to work for them. There wasn't a sense that anyone could start their own design label. But I feel like, even since we started, you are seeing all these people at the same time. I don't know what goes through people's minds, why we are doing the same thing at the same time, but definitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Is there something that happened that caused that change? Is there any one reason people started thinking, I can start my own line now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: The only thing I can say is the globalization of fashion, which I think is really amazing. There used to be an idea of an American fashion, French fashion or European fashion, and maybe an Asian fashion or a Japanese fashion. It's not that way anymore. If you are inspired by different designers and different places in the globe rather than just American fashion or New York fashion, then I think people feel much more open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: There is a definite sense of community here, which is very different from somewhere like Paris or Milan. I think it exists more in London, but the idea that you can succeed as a young designer is something very important in the industry in New York. It is something that people want to support. They are looking for talent, and they are looking for new things. I also think, when you look at Paris or you look at Milan, there are just so many really big, huge houses. This is a very practical matter, but they take up a lot of room on the schedule and budgets in general for stores. It's just a lot more difficult to break into those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. And you think New York has more room for new faces, new lines?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: Yes, people are always looking for what's new, which can be detrimental, because you could be a flash in the pan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Sophie and Joseph, you both worked in Europe but you decided to start your businesses here. How do you think your presence affects what people think of as American fashion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: For me, I think it's very important to be in New York because, as Joseph said, you don't have the weight of the old-fashioned couture houses that exist in Paris. You don't have this big group, so it's possible for you to make something in New York because the people are willing to know about you and they give you that chance, and I think it's fantastic. You don't find that in Paris for sure, because it's more closed. I was inside that Paris business, but here it's more open. All the designers know each other, we hang out together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What do you think defines American fashion today? It always used to be good old-fashioned sportswear and practical clothes. Now it seems something that's hard to put your finger on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: There isn't really an aesthetic school you can point to and say, this is what's happening in New York. It really is varied, and there are a lot of directions. But maybe what you can point to is that there is room for a lot of smaller, very specific points of view. I think that is unique here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: I started with the concept I wanted to do something useful and helpful in Kenya and start a business there. I had been collecting textiles there, and somehow I thought fashion would be really easy, because I didn't know anything about it from a business point of view. But I also felt there was a need to have a print-driven line, and I wanted to make clothes for friends so I just did it. And then I realized how hard it was once I started, but we were lucky enough to have support early on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. LEE: You have to be a designer who is receptive to what your customers want, but at the same time you have to have your vision. For me, inspiration comes from when I am away from fashion. I really enjoy going to museums, to new places. That is really when I pick up inspiration. It's from my surroundings, the book I'm reading, people I'm with, conversations I'm having. At the same time you have to have your vision, but you also have to be receptive to what customers' needs are, so you try to find a medium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What about production, figuring out the retail and editorial worlds? How did you go about doing it? Was it hard for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: Well, I had worked at other companies before in Paris as well. And I think that was very helpful when I was setting up the company. Just having a global vision of how things generally work with the press aspect and the commercial aspect was something that guided me through how I set up my company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: Doing it in Kenya where there is not a tradition of high-end women's wear being made was incredibly difficult. There's no kind of industry that is pre-existing. We have to work a little bit ahead of schedule just because we've got such a big, difficult production monster that somehow I've created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Who gave you the best advice?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: For me, the most important incubator for my business was the store Opening Ceremony. I had things in the store, like two or three pieces, when they opened, and really grew within that store for the first two years or so before it was anywhere else. That process of building up very slowly, before having any showing to the press or anything, was really valuable for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: For my part, it was Janet Brown, in Port Washington. She was a retailer. I was doing a company called Motu Tane before, and that company stopped. She called me and she said, no, no, no, you cannot stop. You have to continue what you are doing. I am going to call every retailer to say to wait for you, and she said to my partner, you are to function like an iPod. She helped us to make that decision to continue and make Sophie Theallet a brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Did you say function like an iPod? What does that mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: Yes, to be really strong, and you are to make decisions really fast, and don't think about the problems that you are going to have. You have to go, and that's it. We don't want to hear about complaining or whatever. Just go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Well, that brings up an interesting point. Michael Kors, just before the C.F.D.A. awards this year, made a comment about how quickly the spotlight shines on new labels today. He said: ''The spotlight is so quick, it's really hard to start anything under the radar. I don't know if you can still let a business percolate and grow naturally.'' How do you all cope with the speed of exposure that is a result of the media frenzy, as well as the Internet age, and can you work it to your advantage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: We got a lot of attention, even before we had a single piece in a store. We had Time magazine come to Kenya to spend a week with us two or three months before we had anything in the stores because they were interested in the business model. I also talked to you before I had a single piece in a store, which meant that we had to control our growth, because our capacity wasn't there. We still control it, because we are building the capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: I think you can control the limelight. I mean, you don't have to say yes to everything. You can pick and choose and decide how you want to grow. Of course the Internet part is a little harder to control, but at least for magazines and for written press, I think that you can completely control how much exposure you get. The way I look at the development of the brand, it has been really important to wait for the right things to come along and not just jump on the first story that was offered to us. It is true that there is a thirst for newness in New York, and it's easy to build something up, but when you are building it so fast, it's also very easy to collapse. I think if you control the way that you build your brand, image-wise, but also in terms of distribution, you have a much more stable base over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: I would definitely agree with that. For all of us who are new, it's actually a huge opportunity. It's almost like, not a democratization of fashion, but something where there is this limelight that is looking for new things. You get the choice of what exposure you want, instead of begging to be part of a story of older brands and bigger companies. I especially like all the blog and Internet press, because I think it's really interesting to see all different people's viewpoints. Fashion doesn't have to be so monolithic or just one voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What goes through your head when you have a show?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: Anxiety and stress. It's not fun at all. I mean, really, it's such an archaic way of showing clothes if you're just doing a runway show with people sitting down. It's kind of bizarre if you think about it. It doesn't really make that much sense, the logistics of it, getting everybody there on time and sitting down. But at the same time there is a kind of magic that happens. So it has its plusses and minuses, but what you think about is that it is incredibly stressful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: I would love to send a tape to the journalists and that's it, but it's not possible, really, because the people complain about the show, but at the same time they need to go to the show to see what you are doing. I know it's not an easy way, so I'm doing a presentation this year, so it will be a bit different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. There's a lot of noise around the shows these days. What do you think is driving the either the interest in New York in fashion or in Fashion Week?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: I think it's the energy, and fashion as entertainment, which I think is a shame. I'm interested in more of a craft tradition or working with interesting materials or the idea of a personal relationship with clothing. Everyone wants to go to a show, but you can see it in any picture anywhere on the Internet one hour afterwards -- or at the same time if we stream the shows. In terms of who I wanted to reach, there is a specific person who feels something in common with the clothes, rather than the idea of fashion as reality entertainment or drama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: There is also a lot of curiosity in general. To me, a lot of it is fueled by blogs and the Internet. Look at Anna Dello Russo's fame, thanks to the Internet. It's incredible to me that people outside of the industry know who Carine Roitfeld or Anna Dello Russo are because it's such a really small, insular heart of the fashion industry. A lot of people that I seem to see in front of show venues are just there to take pictures or to see people going into the show, not even necessarily trying to get in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Does that ever make you feel like a novelty in that regard, having everybody watching you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: If you choose to do fashion, anyway, you make the choice to be watched. Somewhere, even if you don't want to say it, you want the people to watch after you. We're all here because we want success. That is also the reality of why we are doing what we are doing, because we can do another job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.We're also at a point where there are a lot of new initiatives that are designed to help designers survive in New York, from the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue and the Fashion Incubator around the corner. Have these things really helped designers in New York?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: Yes, definitely. These initiatives are very specific to New York. They were definitely a big draw when I decided to open the company in New York. I think there is a monetary and financial aspect to all of these initiatives. They just help you out with money. But there is also a huge press aspect to it as well and exposure that is very rare. It doesn't really exist in other cities. It doesn't exist in Paris. It doesn't exist in Milan. The amount of exposure you get from the C.F.D.A. Vogue Fund is really astonishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Who inspires you as designers? Who are your role models?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: I think, not necessarily aesthetically, but as a business, Dries Van Noten is a really interesting business, because it's based on clothes, which seems pretty much near impossible. It's privately owned. It seems like a very stable business. And it's a pretty big business. Whenever I go into an appointment with a store and I ask what's selling well, it's always Dries Van Noten, pretty consistently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: I like Dries as well, and I think Junya Watanabe and Rei [Kawakubo] I like quite a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: Even before we started our company, I have always been inspired by the way Raf Simons has grown his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: When I was a teenager in the '90s, I was looking a lot at Helmut Lang. When I think about what's a good business model or what's a good approach to treating a brand and all these things, I always think the way he did it was impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: Of course, Azzedine Alaia, for the way that he is, because he is doing collections exactly as he wants. Dries, as you say, for the way that he makes a business, and Prada also. And Yves Saint Laurent for his personality and for what he did in fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. LEE: I really admire Martin Margiela. He is very visionary, but he has always paced his exposure, and his line always stays true to what he believes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. So not one American designer? Do you think that's telling?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: I was thinking about this before. A business like Ralph Lauren I admire. I just don't know if that is something that can really be achieved anymore. That level and that size, that all-encompassing product range, that lifestyle. I just think it doesn't feel like it's really possible anymore. On that scale, something like Prada is a little more attainable. What I think is interesting about Prada is that there is also this idea of a created heritage. Prada is not that old of a brand, but it feels really old, which I think is really smart, which is what Ralph Lauren did. Essentially he appropriated America as his legacy and his heritage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What did you mean when you said it would be impossible just to sell and design clothes today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: That's exactly what I meant. There is a very interesting disconnect, sometimes, between what clients are looking for and what buyers are looking for and what designers are making. You can do something really well in Italy with beautiful fabric, and it's going to cost $2,000 at retail, but Zara is going to make the same thing in Portugal, one month later, for $250. The people who are really discerning will buy your product, but most of them will just want the look of what you made and buy it at Zara. I think it's become harder to have a big business based on clothes. There are very practical financial concerns, like you have much smaller margins. There's demand for high-quality clothing with high perceived value at a lower cost. We've tackled this issue by keeping our cost structure very, very small. We're an extremely small team, basically making sure that we build our sales before building basically the infrastructure of our company and the cost structure of a company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: I don't know if I've figured out the secret, but something that has helped a lot, especially in the last six months since we launched it, is online retail, selling at retail price directly to the customer online. That has changed the way the business is run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: Do you sell internationally online?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: We do, but mostly the orders come from North America, which is understandable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: We've had a huge amount of growth in China, which has really been interesting. I guess politically or economically, you are seeing there is more money in China, and people are interested in buying clothing from new designers. They are really open, so for us, we've seen a lot of growth there. It's been surprising and interesting. Age really isn't an issue for us in Asia, especially in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Is China on your minds today? Everyone in the industry is trying to figure this out. Given that yours are new businesses, what can you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: For me also, Asia -- non-Japan Asia -- has been really big for me, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and also now starting mainland China. It's a mystery to me, because I've never been there, but at the same time, it seems to work and they seem to be interested. They buy it well and they are informed. It's been a really big part of our growth in the last year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: Do you make a different product line for them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: No. Same wholesale prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: We don't do different sizing. We do the same thing as we do for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. We've heard from a lot of stores that young women in their 20s are just not as brand loyal as their predecessors might have been. How do you as designers deal with this generation that is shifting away from brands?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: I actually think it's fantastic because it's not so much about people obsessing over a brand, or over perceived luxury. I don't know about everyone here, but that's the way I dress. If I see something I love, whether it's vintage or our own clothes or some shoe I find really beautiful that I see, that's how I dress rather than feeling like I'm only going to buy one look. Someone's going to tell me how I should dress? Or what my look for the season should be, and I'll buy a designer head to toe? I just don't think that's realistic to how people want to dress. And to me, I think it's freeing for how we design our clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you have to design a certain number of sweaters and pants with the stores and magazines in mind? Especially online sites where they are really focusing on categories when you're shopping?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: I think about categories, definitely. You want a well-rounded collection. I don't want to just have some items and then miss out on something else. We also see what people are interested in, in terms of what we buy, what sells better, or what people are particularly interested in. The good thing about having your own business is that you see how you are being received, but also, you have the power to make the decision of what you are actually going to design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What was the single best decision that you have made?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: I think just starting small and slow, and that's not everyone's approach. It was mine. I literally just started with two or three pieces in a friend's store and just built it very gradually from there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: To apply to the C.F.D.A., because it made my name recognized as an American brand. People were thinking I was a Frenchwoman who does fashion and comes to New York to sell to New York, which I am not doing. My company is American, and everything that I am doing actually is done in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. LEE: I think the single best decision was for me to have a smaller company structure. I take over a lot more responsibilities, and, in a way, I get to learn a lot more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: I'd have to agree, that's also the best decision I've made, to keep the company very small and the infrastructure very small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAMS: I would say for me, probably to work with another partner. Myself and Flora design together, and we have a third partner, Stephen [Courter], who works with us on the financial side, on the press and sales, and also merchandising. That has been really freeing and helpful for us, business-wise, because we can focus on the collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: For me, I think it was hiring Erin [Beatty], who I design with. For one, she knew what she was doing, and two, she also has worked in big companies and small companies, so she also had a big say in how we structured the company. I definitely needed a lot of hand-holding. I probably still do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Well there's also a new generation of press out there, the fashion bloggers. What do you think of them? Do you take them as seriously as you take the traditional media, or more so? And whom do you follow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: I think some of them are really insightful and have really interesting things to say. Going back to Twittering and things like that, I think there's an advantage in keeping that at arm's length as a designer. If people know that you're going to the grocery store or...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: ...doing your laundry...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALTUZARRA: I think it's like a pendulum, and now we're in this moment where it's just very extreme. I have a feeling that if all of a sudden, if everyone is Twittering, and everyone is live-streaming their show, there is going to come a point when everyone is going to want to see the show that is not live streamed. They are going to want to know what someone who is not Tweeting is doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What do you think the future of this city's fashion is going to be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: I thing it's becoming more and more huge. I think people are really watching more and more what's going on in New York with all these new designers. I think people are looking at what's going on, because there is a lot of effervescence and it's great. It's a takeover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ERVELL: I'm guessing it's probably harder to start a company now than it was four years ago. The economy, it's a completely different world now. Maybe there was a window where there was a lot of space to start new. To start new now might be harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. One last question: How do you know that you've made it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. OSTERWEIS: Give us a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. THEALLET: When I'm going to have an atelier the way that I dream, because so far, I am a really small company. I have like two persons working with me: my partner, myself and my seamstress and that's it. So when we know that we are going to make it, I'm going to send you a postcard from an island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. LEE: I think we've all made it. We're all actualizing our dreams. We're all doing what we want to do, so in a sense, we've made it.</p>

All Rights Reserved.   </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are deeply worried about the economy and their jobs -- and about whether their elected representatives in Washington have a real plan for digging out of this mess. They are right to be worried. But this week, at least, voters were given a clear choice about the direction the country can take in November and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama -- who took too long to engage this debate -- gave two sensible and, finally, passionate speeches. He said that to create jobs and stabilize the economy, the federal government will have to help businesses invest more, and it will have to spend some more, for a while longer. And he said that the country will never be able to wrestle down the deficit if Congress gives in to Republican demands to extend $700 billion in unjustified and unaffordable tax breaks for the wealthy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speeches were a pointed rebuttal to Representative John Boehner, the House Republican leader, who has spearheaded his party's implacable opposition. In a speech in Ohio last month, billed as the definitive Republican position on the economy, he declared that ''the prospect of higher taxes, stricter rules and more regulations'' was choking recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president was exactly right when he said that Mr. Boehner's proposals were nothing more than a return to the past decade of economic mismanagement; the same policies that helped turn budget surpluses into crippling deficits nearly destroyed the financial system and cast millions of Americans into long-term joblessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do we return to the same failed policies that ran our economy into the ditch,'' he asked on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immediate battle is over President George W. Bush's tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Mr. Obama wants to make the tax cuts permanent for families that make less than $250,000 a year and let the tax cuts expire for those who make more -- about 2 percent of taxpayers. Mr. Boehner says he wants to extend all of the tax cuts for two years -- although there is little doubt that the goal of Republicans is to extend all of them permanently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes good sense to extend the middle-class tax cuts temporarily because the weak economy needs the boost, but it makes no sense to extend them for the rich. Middle-class Americans spend tax breaks, while wealthy taxpayers generally save them. In the longer term, more revenue will be needed to keep rebuilding the economy and meet health care and other obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're not surprised that Mr. Obama avoided that hard truth. But Mr. Boehner and his party's position is an utter denial of reality. In the real world, it was lower taxes for the rich, lax rules and deregulation that hurt middle-class Americans and dragged the economy to this dangerous pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boehner's much professed concern for small businesses is misdirection. The tax cuts that Mr. Obama would let expire would affect very few owners of small businesses -- how many do you know who make more than $250,000 a year? -- by any common-sense definition of that term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boehner said he was fed up with ''Washington politicians talking about wanting to create jobs as a ploy to get themselves re-elected while doing everything possible to prevent jobs from being created.'' Amazingly enough, he was not talking to Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama did more than just rebut Mr. Boehner. He also offered some sound ideas -- some that also had Republican support, at least until Mr. Obama raised them. He proposed on Wednesday to allow businesses to write off all the investments they make in 2011, rather than over several years, to close loopholes that reward businesses that send jobs overseas and to permanently extend a research and development tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama again called on Congress to pass legislation that would make more credit available to small businesses -- legislation that Senate Republicans, for all their claims of concern for small businesses, have delayed passing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is any good news from Mr. Boehner and other Republicans it is that they suddenly want to seem eager to shed their reputation as the Party of No. This week, they suggested that they might be open to some of Mr. Obama's ideas, which include a $50 billion initial investment to create jobs improving roads, rail lines and airports -- as long as those projects were not paid for by taxing billionaires, oil companies and other wealthy corporations. That, of course, is just how Mr. Obama intends to pay for them -- and just how he should.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's speeches were a robust effort by the president to rally Democrats for the election. It has been a long time coming. And we wish that Democratic leaders in Congress could show the same clear thinking and the same willingness to go head to head with the Republicans. Some commentators are likely to say that Mr. Obama should not have given a national stage to Mr. Boehner, a relative unknown despite his immense power in Congress and his ambition to be the next speaker of the House. But that is just what he needed to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For far too long, Mr. Boehner and others have been dominating the political debate with insincere sound bites, Jedi mind games and plain bad economics. How can they claim to care about the deficit and insist on more tax cuts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, unfortunately, is that they can, and they have, because Mr. Obama has sat on the sidelines and most Congressional Democrats have run for the hills. We are glad to see Mr. Obama fully in the fight.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Many Democrats have joined Republicans in pushing for the repeal of a tax provision in the new health care law that imposes a huge information-reporting burden on small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To improve compliance, the law requires businesses to file a 1099 tax form identifying anyone to whom they pay $600 or more for goods or merchandise in a year. Businesses will also have to send copies of the form to their vendors, suppliers and contractors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses denounce the requirement, and even the national taxpayer advocate at the Internal Revenue Service, Nina E. Olson, said the reporting burden might ''turn out to be disproportionate as compared with any resulting improvement in tax compliance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House is nervous about a repeal, fearing that it could set a precedent for rolling back other unpopular features of the law. Moreover, the reporting requirement is expected to lead to a significant amount of revenue -- $17 billion over 10 years -- to help pay for the expansion of coverage and other health initiatives. It is unclear whether Democrats and Republicans can reach agreements on repealing the provision and on finding a way to offset the loss of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the law, businesses will be required to report purchases of items like office equipment, food and bottled water, gasoline, lumber and plumbing supplies if payments to any vendor in the course of a year total at least $600. They will, in many cases, also have to report payments for things like travel and telephone and Internet service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual reports must include the vendor's address and taxpayer identification number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and some lawmakers say the reporting requirement will induce businesses to pay more of the tax they owe -- just as individuals are more likely to pay tax on dividends and interest income knowing that such information has been reported to the I.R.S. by mutual funds, banks and other corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Republicans, Representative Dan Lungren of California and Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska, are leading efforts to repeal the reporting requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late July, 239 House Democrats voted for repeal, but the bill did not get the two-thirds majority needed for approval under the expedited procedure used then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate is scheduled to vote on a repeal, as an amendment to a small-business jobs bill, soon after it reconvenes this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama strongly supports the jobs bill, which would provide loans and tax breaks to small businesses. But he has not embraced a repeal of the reporting requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Republicans want a full repeal. In a recent speech, the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said the ''1099 mandate'' showed how the health care law could ''wreak havoc on employers and entrepreneurs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans also see the new requirement as an example of the intrusive role they say the I.R.S. will play in enforcing the health care law, including its requirement for most Americans to carry insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Democratic leaders prefer a proposal by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, that would reduce the scope of the reporting requirement. Under Mr. Nelson's plan, businesses with 25 or fewer employees would be exempt from the new requirement, and the reporting threshold for larger businesses would be set at $5,000, rather than $600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nelson says more than 90 percent of companies would qualify for the small-business exemption under his proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Johanns said this ''half-measure'' was unacceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Cathcart, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business, said many businesses would still have to keep track of their payments to each vendor to see if they exceeded the $5,000 threshold for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, a vulnerable Democrat running for re-election, voted for the health care law but supports Mr. Johanns's effort to repeal the reporting requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We must not create unnecessary burdens for small businesses that serve as the backbone of Arkansas's economy,'' Mrs. Lincoln said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help make up for the loss of revenue, Mr. Johanns would cut spending from a new prevention and public health fund. Mr. Nelson would increase taxes on big oil companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the House, Representative Scott Murphy of New York has led the Democratic efforts to repeal the reporting requirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This 1099 reporting was a well-intentioned provision to try to catch people who were cheating on their taxes,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''But it has some unintended consequences and could be a huge hassle for a lot of small businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reporting requirement was in the health care overhaul bill unveiled in mid-November by the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. But it drew little attention at the time -- it was one of more than 15 revenue-raising measures in the bill -- and many lawmakers were apparently unaware of it when they voted for final passage of the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four Democratic senators who voted for the bill have sent a letter to the I.R.S. expressing concern that ''the new requirements may place a hardship on small businesses.'' The letter was signed by Evan Bayh of Indiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, lawmakers have complained about the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid voluntarily. Reducing this gap is a top priority for some lawmakers, but resistance to the new reporting requirement shows how difficult it is to achieve that goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report on the tax gap, the I.R.S. said that ''there is a serious problem with underreporting'' of income by sole proprietors, who own unincorporated businesses by themselves. The Bush administration twice urged Congress to help close the gap by expanding information-reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Olson, the independent taxpayer advocate, said the new reporting requirement would apply to over 38 million businesses, including 26 million sole proprietorships and 2 million farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The I.R.S. will face challenges making productive use of this new volume of information reports,'' Ms. Olson said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MODERN tools of data analysis -- fast computers, smart software and vast troves of digital information -- often open the door to new insights. Consider the subject of jobs in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the assumption has been that small business is the economy's dynamic engine of job generation. Look at the numbers broadly, and that is the irrefutable conclusion: two-thirds of net new jobs are created by companies with fewer than 500 employees, which is the government's definition of a small business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But research published last month by three economists, working with more recent and detailed data sets than before, has found that once the age of the businesses is taken into account, there is no difference in the job-producing performance of small companies and big ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Size plays virtually no role,'' says John C. Haltiwanger, a co-author of the study and an economist at the University of Maryland. ''It's all age -- start-ups are where the job-creation action really occurs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-ups account for much job destruction as well. Within five years, half of these businesses have folded. Yet the survivors are prime candidates to join the young, dynamic companies that make an outsize contribution to innovation, productivity gains and job growth, Mr. Haltiwanger says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So any serious discussion of job creation, it seems, should look at the business tactics and policy steps that are most likely to nurture more of these promising corporate upstarts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing that can be tricky, however, and government small-business initiatives are often misguided, according to Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School. Government programs to stimulate bank lending, he says, are not geared to entrepreneurial start-ups. Those new companies need equity investment to fund risk-taking, free of the financial burden of paying interest on loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lerner is concerned about the impact of the Obama administration's plan to raise the tax on long-term capital gains -- profits on investments held more than a year -- to 20 percent from 15 percent for taxpayers with household incomes of at least $250,000. It could well reduce early-stage equity funding by angel investors, typically individuals who provide the seed capital for new companies well before venture capital firms put in money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capital gains taxes are an important part of the calculus of angel investors,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the small-business sector as a whole, individual income tax rates are an important issue, and small-business lobbying groups are fighting the administration's proposal to raise the top rate to 39.6 percent from the current 35 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet that is not the perspective of start-ups. Most young companies make precious little income during their first few years, and their leaders are focused on hitting it big, not on tax rates. In the 1970s, for example, when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs founded their companies, the top income tax rate was 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For entrepreneurs, the marginal income tax rate doesn't make any difference,'' says David Friend, 61, a founder of six companies over the last three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mr. Friend is the chief executive of Carbonite, a five-year-old technology company based in Boston. It grew out of the observation that few people make backup copies of digital photographs, personal records and documents that they have stored on their computers -- and often lose them if a hard disk crashes or a notebook machine is lost or stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Friend and his co-founders set out to build an easy-to-use online backup service for consumers and small businesses. It stores their information remotely and offers unlimited storage for $55 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carbonite's revenue is doubling annually, to an estimated $40 million this year, Mr. Friend says. Its employment in the United States, largely engineers and marketing staff, has more than tripled in the last two years, to 132.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Barry Silbert, 34, start-up success has been a result of spotting a market opportunity and, then, deft execution. Five years ago, as a young investment banker, Mr. Silbert recognized the growth in restricted stock issued to corporate managers. This stock cannot be traded on public exchanges, so he wanted to set up a new marketplace to trade those shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silbert began in a tiny office in New York City with five people, two telephones and a few desktop computers. Their trading technology consisted of Excel spreadsheets, he recalled. It was a ''lean start-up'' before that term was widely used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But that meant we were profitable almost from the start,'' says Mr. Silbert, the chief executive of the company, called SecondMarket.Today, SecondMarket is best known for dealing the private shares of fast-growing tech start-ups like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and LinkedIn. These companies have not yet gone public, but former employees and others often want to sell their shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SecondMarket is growing rapidly, he says, with revenue of $35 million last year, and its work force has more than doubled in less than two years, to 150. It plans to expand abroad, in Asia and Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Silbert, work-force issues trump taxes as a long-term concern. Like many other entrepreneurs, he advocates granting more residence visas to skilled immigrants, especially those who attend American universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The best and the brightest from other countries come here, and then we're not letting them stay,'' he said. ''That will damage innovation and job creation in the United States.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREIGN-BORN entrepreneurs have long played a big role in American start-ups. A study that tracked technology and engineering start-ups from 1995 to 2005 found that one quarter of them had a foreign-born chief executive or head technologist; by 2005, the surviving companies generated $52 billion in sales and employed 450,000 workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that policy makers are looking to accommodate highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs, says Robert Litan, an economist at the Kauffman Foundation. As one example, he points to legislation proposed this year by Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana. Called the Start-Up Visa Act, it would grant visas to immigrant entrepreneurs who create jobs in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this economic environment, I think job-creating ideas that don't cost money are going to get a fair hearing,'' Mr. Litan says.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Senate advanced legislation to aid small businesses on Tuesday after months of Republican resistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama strongly supports the bill, which would provide loans and tax breaks to small businesses, and its swift enactment seems assured.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Republican senators, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and George LeMieux of Florida, joined Democrats in clearing a procedural hurdle for the bill by a vote of 61 to 37 -- all but guaranteeing that the Senate will approve the bill later this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House, which has already approved similar legislation, is expected to then put its final stamp of approval on the measure without delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some House Democrats are pushing for changes, but that would require another round of votes and the White House and Democratic leaders seem eager to send the bill to Mr. Obama for his signature, given the contentious and unpredictable atmosphere of the election season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Mr. Obama praised the Senate action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a bill that would cut taxes and help provide loans to millions of small-business owners, who create most of the new jobs in this country,'' he said, adding, ''Small businesses across the country have been waiting for Washington to act on this bill for far too long.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With another round of primary elections under way, Congressional Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday continued to clash over the expiring Bush-era tax cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, announced that he wanted to attach a major piece of immigration legislation -- called the Dream Act -- to the annual Pentagon authorization bill, which he hopes to bring to the Senate floor next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dream Act would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who arrived in the United States before age 16, resided in the country for five years, earned a high school diploma or an equivalency degree and then completed two years of college or military service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The military bill is already more contentious than usual because it contains a provision allowing the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy regarding gay personnel in the services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid's decision only raised the political stakes. (His own re-election campaign in Nevada, for instance, could hinge partly on the turnout of Hispanic-American voters.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid, at a news conference, noted that Congress had been unable to move forward with comprehensive immigration legislation but said that the Dream Act was an important step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kids who grew up as Americans should be able to get their green cards after they go to college or serve in the military,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Democrats were loading up the annual Pentagon measure with too many unrelated issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to have a number of extraneous measures in it that have nothing to do with defense, which is making it needlessly controversial,'' Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, has already said he will try to block the legislation over the effort to repeal ''don't ask, don't tell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, as part of the debate over the small-business measure, efforts to repeal or roll back a new tax-reporting requirement for the nation's businesses failed Tuesday when neither party managed to muster the 60 votes needed to advance its approach to the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses led efforts to repeal the information-reporting requirement, a little-noticed provision of the new health care law that they said would impose a huge new burden of paperwork and administrative work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the efforts to reduce paperwork facing many small businesses fell victim to lingering disagreements about whether to make any changes to the health care legislation enacted in March after bitter partisan debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To improve compliance, the new health care law requires businesses to file tax forms known as 1099s identifying anyone to whom they pay $600 or more for goods or merchandise in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses will also have to send copies of the form to their vendors, suppliers and contractors. The forms are already widely used to report various kinds of payments of taxable income other than wages, like interest income or dividends. But the health care law requires filing the forms in many more instances than they were typically used before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise of the requirement was that businesses would be more likely to pay taxes on their income if they knew that the income was already being reported to the Internal Revenue Service by their business partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional tax experts said the reporting requirement would induce businesses to pay more of the tax they owe, generating $17 billion of additional revenue in the next 10 years. The money would help pay for coverage of the uninsured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid, who praised Mr. Voinovich and Mr. LeMieux for their support in advancing the measure to aid small businesses, said the bill was ''the most significant thing we have done since the stimulus bill was passed to create jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. LeMieux said the measure was badly needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to pass,'' Mr. LeMieux said moments after the procedural vote. ''It's the right thing to do. It's going to be very good for my state. We have got almost two million small businesses. They are struggling. I visited businesses over August, and they can't get financing.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWICE in the last decade -- in 2002-3 and 2008-9 -- thousands of companies suspended or shrank their 401(k) matching contributions to save money during economic downturns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more recent dropouts are trickling back now, but fewer than half of the companies that shed their match have restored it so far, and many are paying a lower amount than previously. Some companies are considering permanent changes in the way they calculate their share. Consultants and investment managers say it could take at least a year before many employees again get the contribution they received previously -- and many never will.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the caution reflects the uncertain economy. But many companies are rethinking their whole benefits strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a hesitancy to put a match back in this time around, unlike last time,'' said Robert A. Liberto, a senior vice president for Segal Advisors, an investment consulting firm based in New York. ''They don't want to suspend it again in a short period of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have compelling reasons to resume the practice, in which they match, though often not fully, the amount that employees themselves put into their 401(k) plans, up to a specific percentage of salary. <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span> says as many as 9 percent more people join these plans when a match is offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, about 95 percent of plans offer a match (including the 2008-9 suspensions), according to <span class="companylink">Hewitt Associates</span>, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the economy collapsed in fall 2008, approximately 8 percent of plans suspended their match and an additional 1 to 2 percent reduced it, Hewitt says. About 5 percent took similar actions in 2002-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As balance sheets have improved over the last nine months, the matches have reappeared in fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Fidelity surveyed 300 corporate clients in March, it found that 44 percent said they had reinstated their match or planned to. In October, only 27 percent had said so. However, Hewitt found the opposite when it queried 300 companies late last year and again in mid-August: although 80 percent in the first poll had expected to bring their match back in 2010, only about one-third had done so by August. That is a much slower pace than in 2002-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are returning in stages. <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> suspended its match in February 2009, brought it back at half the original level last January and recently announced that it would restore the full contribution next January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the first restoration, ''the economy seemed to be beginning to emerge from the recession, but there was still uncertainty in the global economy,'' Jess Bunn, a <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> spokesman, said. Now, he added, ''our financial performance is considerably stronger, due to an increase in global trade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new matches may not look exactly like the old ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelity clients are tweaking the match formula to provide incentives for employees to save more, said Beth McHugh, the vice president for market insights. Instead of going dollar-for-dollar on the first 3 percent of salary that an employee contributes, for instance, an employer could match half of the first 6 percent. The maximum cost to the company would be the same, but the new formula could spur workers to increase how much they save.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more radical potential change is to tie the corporate donation to profitability, rather than giving a fixed percentage. Robert McAree, a senior vice president for Sibson Consulting (a sister company to Segal Advisors), said that as many as one-fourth of the clients that had cut back their match were considering this approach. So are 2 percent of the 60 match-dropping companies surveyed this spring by <span class="companylink">Towers Watson</span>, another benefits consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies that explored the profit-sharing strategy decided against it, said Robyn Credico, a senior retirement consultant in <span class="companylink">Towers Watson</span>'s Alexandria, Va., office. ''It sounded like a good idea, but you have to come up with metrics,'' she said. ''You have to define 'profit.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 2 percent of the respondents in the <span class="companylink">Towers Watson</span> survey expected their match to be permanently smaller, but experts say that even a shrunken or unreliable match is better than none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You should still save in the plan,'' Ms. Credico said, ''because the match is free money, no matter how small it is.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday approved a multi-billion dollar package of tax breaks and government-backed loans for small businesses, as Democrats sought to use the muscle of their majorities to pursue a Congressional agenda that would make their case for retaining control in the House and Senate this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After surmounting months of Republican opposition to approve the small-business measure and send it to the House, Democrats -- over sharp Republican objections -- set up a floor showdown for next week over a Pentagon policy bill that also touches on the politically charged issues of immigration and gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pentagon bill would not only allow the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, but would also include legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who arrive in the United States before age 16, reside here for five years, earn a high school degree and complete two years of college or military service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immigration language is being added at the behest of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who is eager to mobilize Hispanic voters for his re-election campaign in Nevada, and it reflects a broader Democratic effort to secure support from Hispanic Americans nationwide by promising a comprehensive immigration bill in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To underscore that commitment, President Obama met in the Oval Office on Thursday with three prominent Hispanic Democrats: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Representatives Nydia M. Velazquez of New York and Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the House, Democrats are pressing forward with legislation to promote American manufacturing, an issue of major resonance in some of the battleground states of the Rust Belt, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed effort by Democrats to use their power in Congress to promote their agenda comes as a New York Times/CBS News poll shows voters dissatisfied with Democrats but even more so with Republicans. That could give Democratic incumbents, who are trailing in many polls, an opening in a year when they seem certain to lose seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the measures are not likely to be completed before lawmakers leave Washington to campaign in early October, but Democrats said the legislative push was a good way to show voters, particularly their party's base, that they were battling on numerous fronts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We live in an information age,'' said Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington. ''Every day that can define what you are for and what you're not for is helpful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the two parties also locked in a major fight over what to do about a set of expiring tax cuts, the legislative maneuvering was infuriating Senate Republicans, who said the Democrats were abusing the floor to try to score political points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said the Democrats were turning a normally bipartisan military measure into a vehicle to advance social policy priorities like immigration and gay rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The majority leader is turning legislation on our national defense into a political football,'' Mr. McCain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid seemed only to inflame Republican anger when he conceded in a floor speech that the Pentagon measure had virtually no chance of being adopted until after the election but nonetheless called on Republicans to allow debate to begin next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This bill should be an easy one,'' said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ''We should be a united body and give our troops a responsible defense policy bill they need, and then the defense appropriations bill they need. Without strings. Without games. And save the politics for the campaign trail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reid scheduled a procedural vote for Tuesday, and Democrats need the support of 60 senators to bring the bill to the floor. The Democrats now nominally control 59 seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats said they also intended to offer an amendment to the military bill that would end the practice of ''secret holds'' in the Senate, by which lawmakers can block a bill under the cloak of anonymity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the prospect of potentially steep losses in November, Democrats, led by President Obama, are counting on the small-business measure to illustrate their efforts to revive the faltering economy, and to define Republicans as obstructionists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote on the small-business measure was 61 to 38, with just two Republicans, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and George LeMieux of Florida, joining Democrats in favor of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Voinovich is retiring after this year, and Mr. LeMieux is leaving after serving as a temporary successor to Mel Martinez, who retired last year. Every other Republican voted no except Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, who was absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to providing tax breaks and enhancing a number of existing aid programs within the Small Business Administration, the legislation will create a $30 billion lending program within the Treasury that will channel government-backed loans through community banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he was disappointed that more Republicans had not supported the measure, Mr. LeMieux said, ''I'm just glad we were able to pass it.'' He noted that Florida has more than two million small businesses that stand to benefit from the legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, the primary author of the bill, said she wished it had been approved eight months ago and blamed Republicans for delaying it. ''Every week that we've waited to pass this bill has been another tough week for small businesses throughout this country,'' Ms. Landrieu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that local bankers were eager to begin making loans and that credit could begin flowing shortly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Democratic leaders said they hope to pass the bill quickly and send it to Mr. Obama, who is eager to sign it.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FASHIONISTAS and fans of late-night television have Coco, and now Madison Avenue has Co -- or, to be precise, Co:.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co:, with a colon, is the name of an agency being opened in New York by Ty Montague and Rosemarie Ryan, who surprised Madison Avenue in March by disclosing that they would leave their senior posts at the giant JWT for an entrepreneurial venture. The name -- perhaps one of the pithiest for any agency -- is meant to suggest the Co: business model by evoking words like co-creation, collaboration and co-venturing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fittingly, Mr. Montague and Ms. Ryan had been co-presidents of the North American operations of JWT, part of WPP; she arrived at the agency in 2004 and he joined a year later. Mr. Montague had also been chief creative officer for North America. They joined a lengthy list of top executives of large agencies who have recently left to open their own shops, take ownership stakes in smaller agencies or, in some instances, quit advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in a period of great change in the business,'' Mr. Montague said in an interview. He and Ms. Ryan, who are both 47, are ''in a period of our lives to do our own things,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ryan, who joined Mr. Montague for the interview, chimed in, ''Or never do our own things.'' (They frequently finished each other's sentences during a 30-minute chat, discussing their plans with a reporter for the first time since they left JWT.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair said they knew the world was not waiting for another agency, but one with a nontraditional approach may be welcomed by marketers looking for different approaches to solving problems and selling products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Montague and Ms. Ryan, whose titles at Co: are co-founders, described the agency as a ''brand studio,'' likening it to a movie studio that provides money and infrastructure to a continually changing lineup of actors, writers, directors and producers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Co:, ''teams are formed around individual client needs,'' Mr. Montague said, ''and when the needs are satisfied, the teams are dispersed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To form those teams, Co: will draw from a list of ''co-conspirators'' -- 40 agencies, consultancies and firms that specialize in tasks like media services, digital and interactive marketing, public relations, social media, design, brand identity, event marketing, technology, ideation and gaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's forming relationships with specialist experts,'' Mr. Montague said, or, he added, laughing, ''coalitions of the willing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those potential collaborators -- a mix of established and fledgling agencies -- include Big Spaceship, Blue State Digital, Campfire, Collins, Consigliere, Creative Feed, DKC Public Relations and Integrated Marketing, Horizon Media, MediaLink, Naked Communications, Powell Communications, Propellerfish, Red Bricks Media, Vast Ventures and Victors &amp; Spoils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ty and I have always been looking for something to work on together,'' said Brian Collins, chief creative officer at Collins in New York, which works on design, brand experiences and brand strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Collins compared how he will work with Co: to when he led the Brand Innovation Group at <span class="companylink">Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide</span> and collaborated with agencies like <span class="companylink">AKQA</span> and <span class="companylink">Wieden &amp; Kennedy</span> on assignments for clients like <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>. Co: is opening with four clients, two of which Mr. Montague and Ms. Ryan named: Madison Square Garden, for the New York Knicks, and <span class="companylink">MTV Networks</span>, for the Spike cable channel. The others are a ''luxury conglomerate'' and a consultancy, Ms. Ryan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Jacobs, senior vice president for marketing and ticket sales at the MSG Sports unit of Madison Square Garden, said he was attracted to Co: because the task he confronts -- ''how do you reignite the deeply passionate relationship that existed between the City of New York and the Knicks?'' -- is ''so clearly not an 'advertising exercise' '' but rather requires ''a multidisciplinary approach, part strategy, part storytelling, part brand creation, part technology, part design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to access the various resources Co: offers and throw some of our own in there,'' Mr. Jacobs said, to determine ''what is the future of fan engagement'' with the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co: is also interested in generating revenue through investing in or starting businesses, which agencies like Anomaly and <span class="companylink">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</span> also do in addition to marketing work. That explains the presence of Vast Ventures on the list of collaborators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm an adviser to Ty and Rosemarie and plan to be a 'co-conspirator,' looking at opportunities with them to potentially invest in,'' said Doug Chertok, chief executive at Vast Ventures in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And I plan to invest in Co:,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co: is opening with two senior executives in addition to Mr. Montague and Ms. Ryan. They are Neil Parker, 45, chief strategy officer, who was most recently global head of strategy at <span class="companylink">Wolff Olins</span>, part of the <span class="companylink">Omnicom Group</span>, and Richard Schatzberger, 33, chief technology officer, who was most recently director for creative technology at <span class="companylink">Bartle Bogle Hegarty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plans to hire a fifth senior executive, Ms. Ryan said, a chief commercial officer who would ''help us run the co-venture side.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Montague said the pair ''had a great run at JWT,'' but ''it just felt it was time'' to ''cast our lot outside'' the realm of worldwide agency networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for being entrepreneurial in this economy, tough times often bring on ''a period of innovation,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Starting a business is energizing, exciting and a little bit scary,'' Mr. Montague said. ''When you wake up every day, you don't quite know what's going to happen next.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Congress and President Obama wrestle over whether to let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthiest Americans, one of the most heated aspects of the debate, in Washington and in neighborhoods across the country, is how a tax increase would affect small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama wants to extend the cuts for most taxpayers. But he proposes eliminating them for the top 2 percent of wage earners, whose taxes would rise. Opponents of the plan warn that a tax increase would batter hundreds of thousands of small businesses -- from Silicon Valley start-ups to mom-and-pop convenience stores -- and prevent them from creating the jobs that might lift the sagging economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a body blow to the small-business community,'' said Grover Norquist, president of the conservative advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that emotional appeal, Internal Revenue Service statistics indicate that only 3 percent of small businesses would be subject to the higher tax, and many studies of previous tax increases suggest that it would have minimal impact on hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 97 percent of all businesses owners do not earn enough to be subject to the higher rates, which would be levied on income of over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among the 750,000 businesses that would be subjected to the higher rates in 2011, many are sole proprietors -- a classification so amorphous it can include everyone from corporate executives who earn income on rental property to entertainers, hedge fund managers and investment bankers. Because 80 percent of America's 32 million businesses are sole proprietorships, 90 percent of the tax cut would be derived from businesses without employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade groups lobbying to extend the tax break for wealthy Americans argue that when hobbyists and home-based enterprises are removed from the equation, the total number of businesses affected is closer to 8 percent. Those companies are responsible for nearly half of all business revenue generated in the country, and according to the conservative American Enterprise Institute, would be less likely to invest or hire if subjected to higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much of the research over the last two decades has found that increases in top tax rates can lead to an increase in the formation of small businesses, as wealthy individuals apparently begin start-ups to avail themselves of the more generous tax breaks offered to businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Higher taxes may lead individuals to seek self-employment because the opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance are greater,'' according to a report released this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which surveyed more than 20 studies on the effects of taxes on hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intensity of the debate is a testament to the place that small businesses hold in the culture as a symbol of American ingenuity. That reverence has grown stronger in recent decades, as the decline of large manufacturers has made the economy rely on start-ups and small businesses to create jobs and entire growth industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the way the I.R.S. classifies small businesses is vastly different from the public perception of the neighborhood dry cleaner or the small tool-and-die shop. A report released by the Joint Tax Committee in July found that many of the tax returns categorized as small businesses were actually filed by wealthy taxpayers who earned business income through limited partnerships or S corporations to allow their firms to avoid paying corporate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study found that in 2005, 19,000 of those small businesses had revenue of more than $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats say they are trying to aim tax relief at the small businesses that most need it. On Thursday, they won Senate approval of a bill to offer $12 billion in tax breaks intended to encourage small-business investment and to create a $30 billion fund to encourage community banks to lend to modest-size companies. The measure is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an eye on the deficit, Mr. Obama has said that the country cannot afford the $700 billion it would cost to extend the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans over the next decade. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she supports Mr. Obama's proposal, but it is unclear whether she has enough support in her caucus for the measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tax cuts at the high end have not produced any jobs; it only increased the deficit,'' Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said Thursday. ''We're still paying the price that they have contributed to the deficit all along.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, warned that eliminating the tax cuts on top individuals would quash many businesses just as they started to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you own a 100-worker metal fabrication plant, and your taxes go up 17 to 24 percent, you'll likely stop hiring or lay off workers to compensate,'' he said. ''Small businesses create 70 percent of new jobs, so it's disastrous for job creation to raise taxes on small businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Thompson, a business owner in Zanesville, Ohio, said his company would be forced to make modest cuts in capital spending if the tax breaks expired, but would not change its hiring decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson and his brother Tim own Primary Aim L.L.C., which operates 29 Wendy's fast-food restaurants in Ohio and West Virginia and employs 1,000 people. Although the company averages $42 million in revenue a year, Mr. Thompson said, he draws a salary of less than $250,000 and files as a limited liability company because the rates are lower than the corporate business tax. The company also pays him in dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate, but he declined to specify how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in the restaurant business, so you have to have enough people to serve your customers,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''We wouldn't have as much for capital, upgrades like paving the parking lots, new technology like cash registers, remodeling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Rys, tax counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, said a survey of his organization found that the businesses most likely to be subject to the tax increase were those employing 20 to 250 workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those are the businesses that employ a quarter of the work force and the ones that are most likely to be hiring,'' Mr. Rys said. ''A tax increase means that's less money that those businesses have to spend on growing their business and more money that they're sending to Washington.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 29, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Sept. 18 about the potential effect on small businesses of the Obama administration's proposals for extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts described imprecisely the businesses that would continue to enjoy lower taxes. Companies with no employees would derive 90 percent of the tax benefits if the cuts were extended. Most, but not all, of those businesses are also sole proprietorships, but being a sole proprietorship does not necessarily mean the company has no employees.</p>

''That's just not sustainable for any business,'' Ms. Burton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, she seriously considered dropping health care coverage altogether or shutting the bookstore's doors. But relief arrived in the form of the new health care law. Beginning this year, the law provides generous tax credits to small businesses struggling to maintain health coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After sorting through the somewhat complicated requirements, Ms. Burton discovered her store was eligible for the full credit, which will give the business a rebate of $21,000 this tax year. So for now, the King's English is still in business, and Ms. Burton and her employees have kept their insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people really need their insurance, and I'm right there with them,'' Ms. Burton said. ''I have a son with special needs, and I don't know what would happen to him or us without this insurance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over one-third of Americans work for small businesses with fewer than 100 employees. If you're one of those workers, you know that very few small companies offer comprehensive health insurance -- or for that matter, any health insurance at all. Even when they do, premiums can be prohibitively expensive, because small businesses can't negotiate the discounts given to large group plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help close that gap, the government this year is offering a tax credit to companies with fewer than 25 full-time workers and average wages of less than $50,000 a year. To qualify, employers must pay at least 50 percent of their employees' health care premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses with 10 full-time employees or fewer earning an average of $25,000 or less are eligible for the largest credit, 35 percent of their health insurance premium costs. Companies with larger numbers of employees earning more receive smaller credits on a sliding scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every small shop will qualify for the credits, but a recent study by two advocacy groups, Small Business Majority and Families USA, estimated that 84 percent of small businesses were eligible. (This includes firms that currently offer some type of coverage.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One health care foundation, the Commonwealth Fund, said in a recent report on small business and the new health law that up to 16.6 million workers were employed by eligible companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tax credit and other provisions in the health care law are designed to repair the weaknesses in the health care system and bring small employers on a level playing field with large companies,'' said Sara R. Collins, vice president for affordable health insurance at the Commonwealth Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you own a small business, it might pay to familiarize yourself with the new provisions in the health care law. They may convince you that you can afford to offer health insurance or keep your existing policy in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're an employee at a small company, you could learn the details yourself and make sure your employer is ready to take advantage of the coming changes. Entrepreneurs are busy and not always plugged into these kinds of administrative changes. Your input may mean the difference between getting insurance or going without.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREDIT QUALIFICATIONSA simple worksheet on the I.R.S. Web site (bit.ly/9uXsqM) helps to show whether your firm has the proper number of employees and average salaries to qualify for the new tax credits. The site also has clear explanations of how the credits work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no application process; the business owner simply files one additional form with the company tax return. Start pulling together the figures now, though. The tax credit begins in the 2010 tax year, so the payoff will come as soon as next January, said John Arensmeyer, chief executive of Small Business Majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit is set to expire in 2016, on the assumption that by then most small businesses will have made the transition to the insurance exchanges, where policies will be more affordable and premium costs will be the same for all participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DROPPED COVERAGE Effective Sept. 23, insurance companies will no longer be permitted to deny coverage to people simply because they have gotten sick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, some insurers tried to find errors in a customer's application, then used them as an excuse to deny payment for a large claim. Employees of small businesses were particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law makes this practice illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PREVENTIVE CAREStarting in September, all new health care plans must pay for preventive care, including physicals and other wellness programs. This extra care may mean extra costs for small-business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, the government has set aside $200 million in grant money over five years to help small employers provide programs like smoking cessation, nutrition, physical fitness and stress management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wellness programs are easy for large companies like <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> or I.B.M., but a small firm doesn't have the bandwidth to absorb the administrative costs,'' said Mr. Arensmeyer. Companies with fewer than 100 employees may apply for grants, which are administered by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFFORDABLE OPTIONS Small businesses will have even greater tax benefits once the new state health insurance exchanges are up and running in 2014. The maximum tax credit will increase to 50 percent at that time -- but companies must buy insurance through the exchanges to be eligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, insurance companies will not be able to charge more in premiums based on sex, age or health status. In the past, small companies with older or ill workers were hit with huge premium increases in their company plans, said Ms. Collins of the Commonwealth Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened to Ms. Burton. Three employees, including Ms. Burton, have entered their 60s in the last few years. They are charged higher premiums than other employees because of their age. As a result, health insurance costs for the company, already on the rise, have skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the older employees ended up relocating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were really skating on thin ice,'' said Ms. Burton. ''If she hadn't left, I'm not sure we would have made it through last year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law should help prevent large premium increases. Plus, small companies that have had trouble finding or deciding on an affordable plan should find the job easier with the streamlined exchange options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Currently small businesses pay 18 percent more for the same coverage that large businesses have,'' Mr. Arensmeyer said. The new law, he believes, will go a long way toward closing that gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 23, 2010, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about benefits in the new health care law for small businesses misstated the effect of rising insurance costs on a bookstore in Utah. Health care costs have grown to account for a third of the store's payroll expenses, not its revenue. The article also misidentified the source of the comment that small-business employees had been particularly vulnerable to certain lapses in insurance coverage. The observation was made by several people who were interviewed; the comment was not by John Arensmeyer, chief executive of Small Business Majority.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMAGINE you are a venture capitalist. One day a man comes to you and says, ''I want to build the game layer on top of the world.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't know what ''the game layer'' is, let alone whether it should be built atop the world. But he has a passionate speech about a business plan, conceived when he was a college freshman, that he says will change the planet -- making it more entertaining, more engaging, and giving humans a new way to interact with businesses and one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you give him $750,000, he says, you can have a stake in what he believes will be a $1-billion-a-year company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interested? Before you answer, consider that the man displays many of the symptoms of a person having what psychologists call a hypomanic episode. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -- the occupation's bible of mental disorders -- these symptoms include grandiosity, an elevated and expansive mood, racing thoughts and little need for sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Elevated'' hardly describes this guy. To keep the pace of his thoughts and conversation at manageable levels, he runs on a track every morning until he literally collapses. He can work 96 hours in a row. He plans to live in his office, crashing in a sleeping bag. He describes anything that distracts him and his future colleagues, even for minutes, as ''evil.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is 21 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what do you give this guy -- a big check or the phone number of a really good shrink? If he is Seth Priebatsch and you are <span class="companylink">Highland Capital Partners</span>, a venture capital firm in Lexington, Mass., the answer is a big check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this thought exercise hints at a truth: a thin line separates the temperament of a promising entrepreneur from a person who could use, as they say in psychiatry, a little help. Academics and hiring consultants say that many successful entrepreneurs have qualities and quirks that, if poured into their psyches in greater ratios, would qualify as full-on mental illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is not to suggest that entrepreneurs like Seth Priebatsch (pronounced PREE-batch) are crazy. It would be more accurate to describe them as just crazy enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's about degrees,'' says John D. Gartner, a psychologist and author of ''The Hypomanic Edge.'' ''If you're manic, you think you're Jesus. If you're hypomanic, you think you are God's gift to technology investing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attributes that make great entrepreneurs, the experts say, are common in certain manias, though in milder forms and harnessed in ways that are hugely productive. Instead of recklessness, the entrepreneur loves risk. Instead of delusions, the entrepreneur imagines a product that sounds so compelling that it inspires people to bet their careers, or a lot of money, on something that doesn't exist and may never sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So venture capitalists spend a lot of time plumbing the psyches of the people in whom they might invest. It's not so much about separating the loonies from the slightly manic. It's more about determining which hypomanics are too arrogant and obnoxious -- traits common to the type -- and which have some humanity and interpersonal skills, always helpful for recruiting talent and raising money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some V.C.'s have personality tests to help them weed out the former. Others emphasize their toleration of mild forms of mania, if only because starting a business is, on its face, a little nuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need to suspend disbelief to start a company, because so many people will tell you that what you're doing can't be done, and if it could be done, someone would have done it already,'' says Paul Maeder, a general partner at Highland Capital. ''There are six billion human beings on this planet, we've been around for hundreds of thousands of years, we're a couple hundred years into the industrial revolution -- and nobody has done what you want to do? It's kind of crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON a recent Saturday evening, Seth Priebatsch is sitting in his office/bedroom in the 26,000-square-foot space that houses Scvngr (pronounced ''scavenger''), which he founded in early 2009. Dozens of toy race cars fill a bookshelf on one wall; the other is covered with lists and drawings. The sofa where he crashes in his sleeping bag lies between the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He will explain the genesis of Scvngr, and offer a sort of guided tour of his mind, while sitting on a stool in his bare feet, wearing jeans and a Princeton T-shirt. A pair of Oakley sunglasses are perched, as they nearly always are, atop his head -- part talisman, part personal branding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is lean, smiley and partial to the word ''awesome,'' which he uses as a noun -- as in ''an extra dose of awesome.'' He speaks quickly and with what sounds like a Canadian accent, which seems odd because he was raised in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He first pitched Scvngr as a freshman at Princeton, to a professor linked to an annual business plan contest open to undergraduates and graduates. ''I told him I wanted to build the game layer on top of the world,'' Mr. Priebatsch recalls. ''And he didn't say, 'You're insane.' So I said, 'And I want everyone in the world to help me build it.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scvngr won first prize, which came with $5,000 and emboldened him to apply to a seed financing company, DreamIt Ventures, which gave him $35,000. The victory also caught the eye of a venture capitalist, Peter Bell of Highland Capital, who read about Mr. Priebatsch's prize while surfing the Web one night. Mr. Bell popped off an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was Saturday night, pretty late,'' Mr. Bell recalls. ''I said, 'If you ever come to Boston, I'd love to meet you.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Priebatsch replied immediately: he'd decided to drop out of Princeton and move to Boston. The university would be around a long time, he reasoned, but the moment to start Scvngr was fleeting and couldn't wait a few weeks, let alone three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, what is this potentially globe-altering enterprise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Scvngr is a game that you play on your phone, and playing Scvngr is incredibly easy,'' he begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game allows you to compete and win rewards at stores, gyms, theaters, museums and so on. A Mexican restaurant, for instance, might offer half off your next soda if you fold the tin foil on your burrito into origami, then snap a picture of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this sounds like little more than a gimmicky way to lure in consumers, well, you haven't listened to Mr. Priebatsch long enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We play games all the time, right?'' he says. ''School is a game. It's just a very badly designed game.'' <span class="companylink">American Express</span> cards, with their escalating status, from green, to gold to black -- they are a game. So are frequent-flier miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But game dynamics aren't consciously leveraged in any meaningful way, and Scvngr does that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, apparently, has enormous implications. ''If we can bring game dynamics to the world, the world will be more fun, more rewarding, we'll be more connected to our friends, people will change their behavior to be better. But if this is going to work it has to be something that anyone can play and that everyone can build.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, he says, is the key: Scvngr is both a game and a game platform. Anyone can create a Scvngr challenge, free, using four default games or tools the company offers. There are now 20 million Scvngr challenges in the United States, according to the company, most of which are simple tasks, like ''stand in this spot and say something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, about 1,000 companies and organizations -- including the New England Patriots, <span class="companylink">Zipcar</span>, <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and Warner Brothers -- pay Scvngr to create and manage their challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last decade was the decade where the social framework was built,'' he says -- most successfully by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. ''The next decade will be the decade of games.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging this pitch by reading it, as opposed to hearing it in person, is like appraising a song based solely on its lyrics. Mr. Priebatsch describes Scvngr and the future it portends with burbling fluency, as if it were a country he has visited and one that you must see. He is especially good at giving ''the game layer'' an aura of inevitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hardly clear, though, that such a layer will catch on or, if it does, whether Scvngr will be the company to build it. The field of location-based tech games is crowded, and include standouts like Foursquare and Gowalla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The particulars of Scvngr seem nitpickable, too. The game's points will earn you whatever goodie is offered on the spot, but there is nothing else you can do with them. And some users have found Scvngr's challenges to be pretty lame. More than a few of the contests seem like barely veiled marketing ploys -- like retailers that ''challenge'' you to come up with three words that describe the store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reviews so far have split the crowd. As of last week, a third of the roughly 1,000 people who had weighed in on the latest version of Scvngr in the iPhone's <span class="companylink">App Store</span> gave it the highest rating and one-third gave it the lowest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not relevant to having fun,'' read one review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Priebatsch's pitch has worked, at least by the standards of start-ups, most of which die in the blueprint phase. Part of the reason could be pinned on the investing and tech world's raging case of Next Zuckerberg Syndrome -- the urge to find another Mark Zuckerberg before he starts another <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody inspires N.Z.S. without a promising idea, intelligence and a lot of charisma. Scvngr today has 60 employees, many of them veterans of very successful tech start-ups. As of December of last year, it also had $4 million from Google Ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any list of the qualities that have netted all this talent and money should include Mr. Priebatsch's quasirobotic work ethic. He does not socialize. He no longer reads books, nor does he watch TV or movies. He works from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m., seven days a week. He was reluctant to have a photographer visit for this article because he worried that it might distract employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doesn't he miss going to bars, just hanging out, being 21? Here's where Mr. Priebatsch starts to sound like a teenage Vulcan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had friends at Princeton; I'm sure it'd be fun to see them,'' he says. ''But I know that what I'm going after is huge and others are going after it, and if they're not, they're making a mistake. But other people will figure it out, and every minute that I'm not working on it is a minute when they're making progress and I'm not. And that is just not O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE hypomanic temperament is, of course, not limited to entrepreneurs. It's found in politics (Theodore Roosevelt) the military (George S. Patton), Hollywood (the studio head David O. Selznick) and virtually any field where outsize risks yield enormous rewards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the business world has contributed more than its share of hypomanics, particularly the abusive, ornery kind. The most colorful of the breed was arguably Henry Ford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He epitomizes the unhinged, entrepreneurial spirit,'' says Douglas G. Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University and author of ''Wheels for the World,'' a book about Mr. Ford and his company. ''He became monomaniacal in his belief that the internal combustion engine should be fueled by gas, at a time when everything was electric, and nobody thought you could put gas on a hot motor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ford could be both charmer and ruthless jerk. When he visited rural America to extol the horseless carriage, listeners were often left hoping that he would run for president. With employees, on the other hand, he was an autocrat who never brooked dissent. He clung so stubbornly to his vision -- black cars, and only black cars, for the masses -- that the company almost went bust when rivals like General Motors started offering more choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all conversations about contemporary hypomanics start with the Apple chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. Like Mr. Ford, he is a pitchman extraordinaire with a vaguely messianic streak, and, like Mr. Ford, he can anticipate what people will want before they even know they want it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jobs is also routinely described as a despot and control freak with a terrifying temper, says Leander Kahney, author of ''Inside Steve's Brain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even the prospect of a chewing out by Steve Jobs makes people work 90 hours a week,'' says Mr. Kahney. He treats employees as tools, Mr. Kahney went on, as a means to an end, with the end defined as a universe of Apple products and services that are tailored precisely to his specifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would argue that Jobs has used his control freakery to advantage,'' Mr. Kahney says. ''The hallmark of Apple is the way it controls the entire user experience -- the ads, the stores, the iPods. Nothing is left to chance. That comes from Steve Jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scholars in organizational studies tend to divide the world into ''transformational leaders'' (the group that hypomanics are bunched into, of course) and ''transactional leaders,'' who are essentially even-keeled managers, grown-ups who know how to delegate, listen and set achievable goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both types of leaders need to rally employees to their cause, but entrepreneurs must recruit and galvanize when a company is little more than a whisper of a big idea. Shouting ''To the ramparts!'' with no ramparts in sight takes a kind of irrational self-confidence, which is perfectly acceptable, though it can also tilt into egomania, which is usually not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a grid personality scorecard, across 10 or 12 dimensions, attributes that are critical to success,'' says Michael A. Greeley, a general partner at Flybridge Capital Partners in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to spot the really erratic characters, whom Mr. Greeley calls ''rail to rail'':</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One day they get up and their favorite color is pink. The next day, it's green. I've worked with hypomanics, and where I think it can be quite insidious -- people like this turn on colleagues quickly. An employee could be an incredible contributor, and then, after one mistake, they are out of the lifeboat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEFORE Highland Capital invested in Scvngr, Peter Bell gave Seth Priebatsch's life and resume the vigorous frisking that is standard in the venture capital business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Priebatsch was 19 at the time, which meant that he didn't have a lot of former colleagues or bosses. What he did have, however, was a surprisingly long track record in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scvngr is actually the third company that Mr. Priebatsch has founded. At the age of 12, with money from his parents, he started Giftopedia, a price-comparison shopping Web site. When he was in eighth grade, the company had eight employees -- six in India, two in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody who worked for him ever asked him his age, and he never volunteered it. ''I wouldn't say that I kept my age a secret,'' he says. ''I just never offered that information. Nobody knows how old you are on the Internet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All communications were handled via e-mail and Skype, often while he was typing on a laptop while sitting in class. For a long time, his teachers thought that he was simply taking copious notes, but he was actually sending instructions overseas with a wireless connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One day, I forgot to hit the mute button on my laptop and it started ringing during French class,'' he recalls. The Giftopedia server was down that day, and it was a crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got up and told my teacher, 'I'm really sorry, but I have to take this call.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giftopedia was profitable, but a little late to the field, Mr. Priebatsch says. Ultimately, he sold the domain name for five figures and, at 17, founded PostcardTech, which created and mailed out promotional mini-CDs on behalf of tourist destinations and universities. For that company, he rented part of a factory in China, which, he said, was time-consuming but surprisingly easy and didn't even require a trip to Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Priebatsch handed PostcardTech off to some friends, who did little with it, and the company has since folded. But it left Mr. Priebatsch with a chunk of money -- he won't say how large -- that he has since invested in Scvngr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gartner, the author and psychologist, says he believes that hypomanics come by their disposition genetically. But it is hard to tease out what Norman and Suzanne Priebatsch -- a biotech entrepreneur and a financial adviser at SmithBarney, respectively -- bequeathed through their DNA and what they instilled in Seth and his older sister, Daniella Priebatsch, as they grew up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because chez Priebatsch sounds like boot camp for the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With both my kids, my wife and I pushed them very hard,'' says Norman Priebatsch, who is a native of South Africa. ''Very invasive, very intrusive, doing things, planning things continuously.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a child, when Seth started to read along with his father -- high-level math, physics and history books were the staples -- the elder Mr. Priebatsch would often turn the books upside down, adding a degree of difficulty to the experience, and presumably some fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that Seth can now read as quickly upside down as right-side up, something to keep in mind if you ever find yourself sitting across a desk from him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People assume that if you've got a sheet of paper in front of you that no one else can read it,'' he says, ''and that is false.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacations, Seth says, made school seem relaxing. He and his sister were expected to research destinations -- Istanbul, Shanghai and Rome, for instance -- and then plan most of the itinerary down to the hour. On the trips, they would tour all day and night, leaving time for the children to upload photos to a laptop and type up a detailed account of everything they'd seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were the scribes of those trips; that was a requirement,'' says Daniella, who now works on a sales team at <span class="companylink">Google</span>. ''Every detail -- what it was like at the museum, people we met. Even the room number of the hotel, in case it was a good room and we ever came back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rigor and intensity of Seth's upbringing have left him with a peculiar combination of rarefied skills and mundane deficiencies. He is a gifted software engineer but a terrible driver. (''I hit things,'' he says.) He's perfectly at ease negotiating with V.C.'s, but has had just one girlfriend, a relationship that ended abruptly when someone asked how long they'd been dating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We answered simultaneously and she said six months and I said two weeks,'' he recounts, sounding amused. ''Two weeks earlier we'd had this conversation, and I said, 'And so now we're dating, correct?' And she said yes.''</p>

At the same time, he regards the $750,000 investment as a bet on Mr. Priebatsch as much as a bet on his company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Seth has such a fertile mind; you just know that he'll attract great people to the company,'' he says, ''and the ideas will continue to flow and morph until he finds something great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You also get the sense that Mr. Priebatsch won't stop, even if Scvngr is a glorious triumph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like winning,'' he says. ''I'm addicted to the act of winning, the process. When you are in the act of winning, everything is great. Once you've won, that's boring. It's cool, it's better than having lost, but it's boring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great piles of money would not slow him down, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not anti-money,'' he says. ''I like nice bikes, I like nice computers. I like that money is a representation of success, but the actual entity itself is not interesting for me. There is little that I would want that I don't have, and the things that I want money can't buy.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurial journalism, broadly speaking, simply refers to pulling journalism, business and technology closer together. CUNY already offers a course in entrepreneurial journalism, and this new master's program will extend the traditional degree program to two years from 18 months. The courses in the program will focus on the business of managing media, and the study and creation of new media business models, and it will offer students apprenticeships at New York City start-ups.</p>

Shepard, the founding dean of the school and a former editor in chief of BusinessWeek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school will also offer a certificate in entrepreneurial journalism for midcareer journalists ''who have worked in traditional mainstream media, who understand they need new skills and will come back to get them,'' Mr. Shepard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The journalism school offers a converged curriculum in which students are able to study media across all platforms, including digital, broadcast and print. Students also choose a subject of concentration in arts, business, urban or international reporting. The center will be led by Jeff Jarvis, an associate professor and the director of the school's interactive journalism program, and will reside in the school's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $10 million center will receive $3 million in funding from the Tow Foundation, $3 million from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and additional grants and contributions from the journalism school. The first degrees are expected to be awarded in the spring of 2012.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the debate about whether to extend the Bush tax cuts has focused on big economic issues: how the decision might affect the fragile economy, the widening federal deficit and hiring by small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the political battle drags on, however, it has also veered into a more basic matter of fairness, whether a person who earns more than $200,000 a year should be taxed at rates similar to those who make $5 million.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has proposed preserving the cuts for middle-class Americans and letting them expire for the top 2.5 percent of taxpayers -- individuals who make more than $200,000 a year and families whose income exceeds $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others in Congress have questioned why ending what Mr. Obama frequently calls ''tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires'' should also raise taxes on families making $250,000. The Senate will not vote on the matter until after the midterm elections, and some Democrats are pushing for a compromise that would leave the cuts in place for those higher up the income scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the $250,000 level is too low,'' said Senator James Webb, Democrat of Virginia. ''I'm asking that it be raised.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One proposal being discussed is a millionaires' tax, which would create one or two additional tax brackets for the wealthiest Americans and eliminate the Bush tax cuts only for those who earn more than seven-figure incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress have thus far held firm to the dividing line of $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families. And others warn that making the tax code more complicated often has the unintended consequence of encouraging taxpayers to circumvent the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you make the tax law simpler, more easily understood and fairer, you end up with a higher level of compliance and more revenue,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, co-sponsor of a tax overhaul plan that would eliminate many deductions and exemptions and reduce the total number of brackets from six to three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders in the Senate announced last week that they would not vote on the matter until after the elections on Nov. 2 because some Democrats in tight races worried that Mr. Obama's plan would leave them vulnerable to campaign attack ads accusing them of raising taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the opposition to the plan has come from those who warn that ending the cuts, even on the wealthiest, would further weaken the struggling economy and harm small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the cuts will have expired for everyone on Jan. 1 unless Congress takes action, lawmakers are virtually certain to revisit the issue in the lame-duck session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of the debate is the fact that, like most Western countries, the United States has a progressive tax code that levies higher rates on people with higher incomes. But the concept of class and the issue of taxes are both so politically charged that discussions about how to calibrate those rates and how much income qualifies someone as rich in the contemporary United States are incendiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the presidential campaign in 2008, the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, set off a fury when he was asked the dividing line between middle class and rich and replied that it was $5 million, a statement he said was intended as a joke. Mr. Obama's response was $150,000, a figure that is three times the median family income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With unemployment at 9.6 percent and the economy languishing, discussions about the financial pressures facing the wealthiest Americans can quickly devolve into shouting matches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A University of Chicago professor earlier this month wrote a post on an academic blog complaining that if Mr. Obama's proposal became law, he and his wife, who earn more than $300,000 combined, might have to lay off their housekeeper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responses to the post were so visceral and angry that the professor, M. Todd Henderson, deleted it from the Internet, saying that the ''electronic lynch mob'' had made him fear for his family's safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in some expensive sections of the country, many families with income levels near the $250,000 cutoff insist that they have more in common with middle-class Americans than millionaires or billionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You take a couple in Westchester County, a police officer with a lot of overtime and a principal at a public school,'' said Vincent R. Cervone, a certified public accountant in New York City. ''They're grateful to be working. They aren't in danger of eviction or starving. But the cost of the average house is $500,000 -- five times the national average. Taxes are higher than the rest of the country. If they have a couple of children in college, can you call them rich? Not by any common-sense standard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute over what income level qualifies as rich is caused, in part, by the tendency of people to gauge their own wealth by comparing themselves to those closest to them. A study released this month by two Princeton University professors found that in most of the country, people feel comfortably middle class if they earn $70,000. But in New York City, the figure was $165,000. The median income in New York City is $55,980, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. Bradford DeLong, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said many of the top earners in the United States did not consider themselves rich because they compared themselves to the statistically small segment of the people who earned more than them, rather than the much larger segment who made less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is pathetic and embarrassing that somebody with five times the median household income, someone in the top 2 or 3 percent of the population, thinks of himself as just another 'average Joe,' '' said Professor DeLong, who was a deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury Department in the Clinton administration. ''Why don't you ask someone who makes $40,000 or $50,000 a year if they have a lot in common with a family making $250,000?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that families making $250,000 are sometimes being invoked in the same terms as billionaires is a symptom of one of the paradoxes of the American tax system: at the same time that wealth has become far more concentrated in recent decades, the tax code has become far less precise in differentiating levels of affluence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's tax code not only has far lower rates than it had a half century ago, it has fewer brackets -- just six. Mr. Obama's plan would raise the top bracket (which affects income for individual filers who earn over $382,550) to 39.6 percent, from 35 percent. It would also raise the second-highest bracket to 36 percent, from 33 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's plan would charge the same rate on the 382,551st dollar of earnings as it would on the 30 millionth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax brackets at the upper end of the income scale were not always drawn so broadly. In 1970, when someone earning $37,000 had the buying power of a $200,000 income today, there were 25 income brackets. The taxpayer with $37,000 was taxed at the middle of the scale -- 13 of the brackets charged higher rates to those with higher income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress reduced the number of brackets in the 1980s in an effort to make the tax code simpler and to cut down on the abuse of shelters and deductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 30 years, however, the percentage of total income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans has grown sharply -- to 23.5 percent in 2007, from about 9 percent in 1979. And the income share of the top 0.1 percent has grown even faster -- to 6 percent in 2007 from 2 percent in 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has used those income gains to argue that his plan is fair; at a town hall meeting last week, the president noted that 85 percent of the cost of extending the upper-income tax cuts would go to benefit ''millionaires and billionaires.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is unclear what, if anything, Congress will do to address the issue. Republicans uniformly oppose letting any of the tax cuts expire. Democrats have vowed to pass Mr. Obama's plan after the elections. Given that they are likely to lose seats -- and possibly control of one or both houses of Congress -- it is uncertain whether they will follow through, compromise or simply extend all the cuts for a limited period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric J. Toder, an economist at the Tax Policy Center, said that while the overall tax system was progressive now, there was historical precedent for creating new brackets to address a shift in income to the very highest end of the scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason they fiddle around with the rate schedules and new brackets is to fine-tune,'' he said. ''The economic question is, What economic effects do you get in terms of sheltering income and how would it affect investment? But politics, not economics, will determine the outcome.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over at AOL Small Business, Rod Kurtz recently asked his board of directors what questions they like to ask prospective employees. The answers were interesting and got me thinking. Here are some of mine:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tell me the most stressful situation you experienced at your last job with a customer.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer often gives me a sense of how people cope with difficult situations. It can reveal whether they speak honestly about their own actions, whether they learn lessons and what their attitudes are toward customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why did you really leave your last job? Were you fired? Did you hate your boss?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The follow-ups often elicit a new story. If they tell me that their leaving was ''mutual,'' that's a signal that there is more to the story. If they say ''it was time to move on,'' I ask, ''what does that mean?'' I want someone who is honest and forthright and doesn't hide behind cliches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've learned that different questions work for different jobs. The manager of my picture-framing business, for example, hires people to do ''pick-ups'' -- they retrieve finished framed pictures from a room full of racks for customers. She routinely asks interviewees if they have ever thought about becoming a librarian; those who say they have thought about it tend to do the job best and to stay around the longest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she told me this, I thought it was bizarre. ''How did you figure that out?'' I asked. She just did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What works for you?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the companies that hope to take on Apple in the white-hot market for tablets are industry giants like Dell, <span class="companylink">Google</span>, HP, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and Samsung. But among the startups looking to become tablet contenders, Kno stands out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first wrote about Kno in June, when the company unveiled a dual-screen tablet aimed at college students. The knock against the chunky, 14-inch screen was its heft; it weighs 5.5 pounds, or nearly four times more than Apple's iPad, and each slab was more than half an inch thick.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems as if the criticism was heard. On Monday, months before the first tablet, called the Kno, will ship, the company is unveiling a second model. The new Kno is a single-screen version of the previous device. Both are expected to begin shipping in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From the college perspective, the overwhelming feedback is that the dual panel is great, but some students think a single panel is better for them,'' said Osman Rashid, a founder and the chief executive of Kno. ''At the end of the day, we don't want to lock anyone out of our system because of form factor.'' Mr. Rashid said the single-panel model is likely to appeal to the K-12 market in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kno's mission is to create not only hardware, but also a software system geared for students that will allow them to read textbooks, take notes and perform other tasks. The software system is expected to work not only on Kno's tablets, but also on PCs, iPads and other devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shedding half its bulk and weight is certainly a move in the right direction for Kno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the tablet's biggest fans is Marc Andreessen, the Netscape founder who is now a venture capitalist and a director at <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> and Skype. Mr. Andreessen recently led a $46 million round of financing for Kno. That brought the total raised by the startup to $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether that is enough to help Kno break into the tablet market remains to be seen.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it came to the actual details of governing, Senator Russ Feingold, a Democrat of Wisconsin, trounced his Republican challenger, Ron Johnson, in a debate in Wausau, Wis., on Monday night. He knew that the new health care law will not reduce Medicare spending but will slow its staggering rate of growth. He knew that a vast majority of small businesses would not pay higher taxes if rates went up on the wealthy and that global warming isn't caused by sunspots. He knew that without the 2009 stimulus there would be at least 1.5 million fewer people with jobs.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson, on the other hand, proudly proclaimed recently that he doesn't ''think this election is about details.'' That's as good an explanation as any of why -- in Wisconsin as in so many states -- candidates like Mr. Johnson are ahead in the polls. Insurgent Republicans don't need details when they can play on the furious emotions of voters who have been misled into believing that positive changes like the health care law are catastrophic failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public's lack of attention to detail, and Mr. Johnson's willingness to exploit it, could end the career of Mr. Feingold, who in three terms has distinguished himself for trying to bring fairness to campaign finance and decency to national security, among other achievements. He has routinely crossed party lines to work with Republicans and has had the courage to break with his own party more often than almost any other senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He voted against confirming Tim Geithner as Treasury secretary, citing Mr. Geithner's personal tax issues. He refused to support the Wall Street reform package because it did not go far enough. He was the only senator who voted against the misguided Patriot Act in 2001. He has supported gun rights -- more than we like -- and has opposed hate crime measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feingold's independent mind, and his refusal to follow the big-money line on issues like trade, campaign finance and Wall Street reform, should have endeared him to Tea Party members and other independents who are angry at Washington conformists. If they had taken the time to listen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they are supporting Mr. Johnson, a wealthy plastics manufacturer unknown to them six months ago. Mr. Johnson says he had long believed government restricted business and individual liberties (we're not clear which ones he has in mind) but decided to run for office when the health care bill was passed, claiming that President Obama was trying to create a socialist state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the debate, Mr. Johnson called the bill ''an incredibly expensive overreach.'' When Mr. Feingold noted that it would provide coverage for pre-existing conditions and allow young people to remain on their parents' policies, Mr. Johnson said that it created too much paperwork for small businesses. While dishing out untruths, he said Mr. Feingold voted to cut Medicare benefits, which he has also said in a mailing to older voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Democrats are running away from their solid accomplishments of the last two years, apologizing for their association with President Obama. Mr. Feingold is one of the very few with the self-confidence to offer a full-throated defense of his votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Wisconsin electorate he faces seems to have lost its progressive streak and become more like other Midwestern states. Several polls have shown that the number of likely voters who consider themselves conservative has risen from a quarter of the electorate to nearly half. The misinformation and simplistic solutions propounded by talk radio and the Republican Party are having an effect even in a state that preferred Mr. Obama by 14 points two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the country, the Obama voters who were so energized in 2008 are rueful and dispirited, taking their cue from the timid races run by so many fearful Democratic candidates. Mr. Feingold is making the case that there is a choice to make on Nov. 2 and that there is a need for thoughtful voices in Washington.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE opening scenes of ''The Social Network,'' in which Mark Zuckerberg's character embarks on a manic marathon coding session with his friends, rang eerily true to 23-year-old Jared Hecht. That's because he lived through it -- although not at Harvard and not in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hecht is one of the creators of a group text-messaging application called GroupMe, released in late August after a similar all-night affair.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We literally stayed up for 24 hours, fueled by Red Bull and pizza, to create our company,'' he said. ''So seeing the scene where Mark creates Facemash'' -- <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s predecessor -- ''was like, 'Wow, we've been through that before.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the newest class of entrepreneurs developing the next generation of Web-based companies, ''The Social Network'' is the first time many have seen their startup culture splashed on the big screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much as ''All the President's Men'' and ''Wall Street'' (the original and definitely not the remake) became obsessive movie-going experiences for young journalists and budding Masters of the Universe, the film has become a cultural touchstone for people in the tech world, who finally see on screen a world they recognize as their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Startups have been around since 1939,'' said Chris Wiggins, an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia who runs a group called HackNY that matches computer science students with internships at startups, among other things. ''I can't recall a film like this about one before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Lorenz, a former American studies professor at Georgetown University, said that films revolving around the lives of geeks using the Internet rarely make it beyond cult status. Typically, he said, the subject has been ''a box-office bust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, the ''cultural phenomenon'' of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was such that it probably helped the movie move past niche appeal. In its first two weeks, ''The Social Network'' pulled in more than $50 million at the box office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Peyton, 26, a creator of an app called MessageParty, said the film perfectly ''hit on the founder mentality.'' Added Ms. Peyton: ''You don't do anything else. You wake up in the morning, go to your computer, work until you pass out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Peyton caught the film with her co-founder, Jason Gavris, 23, after a long Sunday spent redesigning their application. ''Over the summer we lived down the street from the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> offices, and our house was pretty much like that -- minus the drugs and girls,'' she added with a laugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the digerati, picking apart fact from fiction and debating the fairness of Mr. Zuckerberg's acerbic portrayal have saturated sites like Twitter, Tumblr and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and nearly worn out their welcome as conversation starters tossed out over beers at the end of a tiring day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexa Hirschfeld, 26, who runs the online invitation site Paperless Post, stood in line to see the movie on opening night along with two other founders, Mike Hudack, of the online video site Blip.tv, and Sam Lessin, of Drop.io, a private file-sharing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, she said, ''I called my brother, who is my co-founder, and we laughed about the lines, the Hollywoodized parts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I even tweeted some of those Winklevii lines,'' she added, referring to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twins who contend that Mr. Zuckerberg stole the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> idea from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE movie hit especially close to home for Ms. Hirschfeld because she was part of the same 2006 class at Harvard as Mr. Zuckerberg -- before he dropped out. ''I used to joke that I hadn't even put my book bag down and the guy had made $150 million,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most interesting part was hearing people talk about the tech industry on the way out after the movie,'' she said. ''It's a real-world mirroring of what's happening online in the last five years, how much <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has become part of the conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was no question you had to see this film right away or you'd be left out of nearly every conversation for the next few weeks,'' said Adam Schwartz, 24, a co-founder of a fashion startup called Source4Style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schwartz did his best to aid those efforts. He organized an opening night screening for the film in conjunction with the NY Tech Meetup, a monthly meet-and-greet for the local technology and media industry. Three hundred people piled into a theater in downtown Manhattan to watch the film together; another 150 names filled a waiting list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many startups, including the 30-plus-employees of Foursquare, a location-based social networking app and darling of the tech scene, the outing was a welcome break from the endless grind of writing code and fixing software bugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to describe what it's like the first time you see people using your product,'' said Dennis Crowley, a founder of Foursquare. ''There are a few moments in the film that capture that. You get the glimpse of how excited the campus in Boston was; then it goes beyond that. We're getting into a similar place where people are getting excited about us the way they were getting excited about <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case in point? The thrill of watching throngs of moviegoers in the theater pull out their phones to check-in using Foursquare before the film rolled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's where the similarities stop, Mr. Crowley said. ''The best perk we have around our office is free M &amp; M's,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a busy afternoon in the West Wing late last month, President Barack Obama seemed relaxed and unhurried as he sat down in a newly reupholstered brown leather chair in the Oval Office. He had just returned from the East Room, where he signed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 -- using eight pens so he could give away as many as possible. The act will be his administration's last piece of significant economic legislation before voters deliver their verdict on his first two years in office. For all intents and purposes, the first chapter of Obama's presidency has ended. On Election Day, the next chapter will begin.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he welcomed me, I told him I liked what he had done with the place. Gone was George W. Bush's yellow sunburst carpet (it says ''optimistic person,'' Bush would tell practically anyone who visited), and in its place was a much-derided earth-tone rug with inspirational quotations. The curved walls now had striped tan wallpaper, and the coffee table had been replaced by a walnut-and-mica table that, Obama noted, would resist stains from water glasses. The bust of Winston Churchill was replaced by one of Martin Luther King Jr. The couches were new. He told me he was happy with the redecorating of the office. ''I know Arianna doesn't like it,'' he said lightly. ''But I like taupe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was something incongruous about the president of the United States checking out reviews of his decor by Arianna Huffington, well, let's face it, he has endured worse reviews lately. The president who muscled through Congress perhaps the most ambitious domestic agenda in a generation finds himself vilified by the right, castigated by the left and abandoned by the middle. He heads into the final stretch of the midterm campaign season facing likely repudiation, with voters preparing to give him a Congress that, even if Democrats maintain control, will almost certainly be less friendly to the president than the one he has spent the last two years mud wrestling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While proud of his record, Obama has already begun thinking about what went wrong -- and what he needs to do to change course for the next two years. He has spent what one aide called ''a lot of time talking about Obama 2.0'' with his new interim chief of staff, Pete Rouse, and his deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina. During our hour together, Obama told me he had no regrets about the broad direction of his presidency. But he did identify what he called ''tactical lessons.'' He let himself look too much like ''the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.'' He realized too late that ''there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects'' when it comes to public works. Perhaps he should not have proposed tax breaks as part of his stimulus and instead ''let the Republicans insist on the tax cuts'' so it could be seen as a bipartisan compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, he has learned that, for all his anti-Washington rhetoric, he has to play by Washington rules if he wants to win in Washington. It is not enough to be supremely sure that he is right if no one else agrees with him. ''Given how much stuff was coming at us,'' Obama told me, ''we probably spent much more time trying to get the policy right than trying to get the politics right. There is probably a perverse pride in my administration -- and I take responsibility for this; this was blowing from the top -- that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That presumes that what he did was the right thing, a matter of considerable debate. The left thinks he did too little; the right too much. But what is striking about Obama's self-diagnosis is that by his own rendering, the figure of inspiration from 2008 neglected the inspiration after his election. He didn't stay connected to the people who put him in office in the first place. Instead, he simultaneously disappointed those who considered him the embodiment of a new progressive movement and those who expected him to reach across the aisle to usher in a postpartisan age. On the campaign trail lately, Obama has been confronted by disillusionment -- the woman who was ''exhausted'' defending him, the mother whose son campaigned for him but was now looking for work. Even Shepard Fairey, the artist who made the iconic multihued ''Hope'' poster, says he's losing hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps that should have come as no surprise. When Obama secured the Democratic nomination in June 2008, he told an admiring crowd that someday ''we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I read that line to Obama and asked how his high-flying rhetoric sounded in these days of low-flying governance. ''It sounds ambitious,'' he agreed. ''But you know what? We've made progress on each of those fronts.'' He quoted Mario Cuomo's line about campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. ''But the prose and the poetry match up,'' he said. ''It would be very hard for people to look back and say, You know what, Obama didn't do what he's promised. I think they could say, On a bunch of fronts he still has an incomplete. But I keep a checklist of what we committed to doing, and we've probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we talked about during the campaign. And I hope as long as I'm president, I've got a chance to work on the other 30 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But save the planet? If you promise to save the planet, might people think you would, you know, actually save the planet? He laughed, before shifting back to hope and inspiration. ''I make no apologies for having set high expectations for myself and for the country, because I think we can meet those expectations,'' he said. ''Now, the one thing that I will say -- which I anticipated and can be tough -- is the fact that in a big, messy democracy like this, everything takes time. And we're not a culture that's built on patience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Obama has been seeking guidance in presidential biographies. He is reading, among others, ''The Clinton Tapes,'' Taylor Branch's account of his secret interviews with Bill Clinton during the eight years of his presidency. ''I was looking over some chronicles of the Clinton years,'' Obama told me, ''and was reminded that in '94 -- when President Clinton's poll numbers were lower than mine, and obviously the election ended up being bad for Democrats -- unemployment was only 6.6 percent. And I don't think anybody would suggest that Bill Clinton wasn't a good communicator or was somebody who couldn't connect with the American people or didn't show empathy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall of 1994, things were even better than Obama recalls: unemployment was in fact 5.6 percent. If the feel-your-pain president had trouble when the economy was not nearly as bad as it is now, with 9.6 percent unemployment, then maybe the issue for Obama is not that he is too cool or detached, as some pundits say. When the economy is bad, even the most talented of presidents suffer at the polls. ''There is an anti-establishment mood,'' Rahm Emanuel, the former Clinton aide who served as Obama's first White House chief of staff, told me before he stepped down this month. ''We just happen to be here when the music is stopping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be bad form for the president to anticipate an election result before it happens, but clearly Obama hopes that just as Clinton recovered from his party's midterm shellacking in 1994 to win re-election two years later, so can he. There was something odd in hearing Obama invoke Clinton. Two years ago, Obama scorned the 42nd president, deriding the small-ball politics and triangulation maneuvers and comparing him unfavorably with Ronald Reagan. Running against Clinton's wife, Obama was the anti-Clinton. Now he hopes, in a way, to be the second coming of Bill Clinton. Because, in the end, it's better than being Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, I made my way through the West Wing talking not only with Obama but also with nearly two dozen of his advisers -- some of whom spoke with permission, others without -- hoping to understand how the situation looks to them. The view from inside the administration starts with a basic mantra: Obama inherited the worst problems of any president in years. Or in generations. Or in American history. He prevented another Great Depression while putting in place the foundation for a more stable future. But it required him to do unpopular things that would inevitably cost him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He got here, and the expectations for what he could accomplish were very high and probably unrealistic,'' Pete Rouse told me. Indeed, David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the masterminds of the 2008 presidential campaign, said they cautioned Obama after his victory to brace himself for a precipitous drop in his popularity given the severity of his challenges. ''I told him at some point that at the end of '10, his approval rating could be low- to mid-30s,'' Plouffe told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even if the White House saw it coming, this is an administration that feels shellshocked. Many officials worry, they say, that the best days of the Obama presidency are behind them. They talk about whether it is time to move on. While not in the 30s, Obama's approval rating in surveys conducted by The New York Times and CBS News had fallen to 45 percent last month from 62 percent when he took office -- just a point above where Clinton was before losing Congress in 1994 and three points above where Reagan was before the Republicans lost a couple dozen House seats in 1982. Joel Benenson, Obama's pollster, pointed out that even at 45 percent, the president's popularity eclipses that of Congress, the news media, the banks and other forces in American life. ''We are in a time when the American public is highly suspect of any institution,'' he said, ''and President Obama still stands above that.'' Obama's team takes pride that he has fulfilled three of the five major promises he laid out as pillars of his ''new foundation'' in an April 2009 speech at Georgetown University -- health care, education reform and financial reregulation. And they point to decisions to end the combat mission in Iraq while escalating the war in Afghanistan. ''History will judge Obama that the first two years were very productive,'' Rouse says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is possible to win the inside game and lose the outside game. In their darkest moments, White House aides wonder aloud whether it is even possible for a modern president to succeed, no matter how many bills he signs. Everything seems to conspire against the idea: an implacable opposition with little if any real interest in collaboration, a news media saturated with triviality and conflict, a culture that demands solutions yesterday, a societal cynicism that holds leadership in low regard. Some White House aides who were ready to carve a new spot on Mount Rushmore for their boss two years ago privately concede now that he cannot be another Abraham Lincoln after all. In this environment, they have increasingly concluded, it may be that every modern president is going to be, at best, average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're all a lot more cynical now,'' one aide told me. The easy answer is to blame the Republicans, and White House aides do that with exuberance. But they are also looking at their own misjudgments, the hubris that led them to think they really could defy the laws of politics. ''It's not that we believed our own press or press releases, but there was definitely a sense at the beginning that we could really change Washington,'' another White House official told me. '' 'Arrogance' isn't the right word, but we were overconfident.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest miscalculation in the minds of most Obama advisers was the assumption that he could bridge a polarized capital and forge genuinely bipartisan coalitions. While Republican leaders resolved to stand against Obama, his early efforts to woo the opposition also struck many as halfhearted. ''If anybody thought the Republicans were just going to roll over, we were just terribly mistaken,'' former Senator Tom Daschle, a mentor and an outside adviser to Obama, told me. ''I'm not sure anybody really thought that, but I think we kind of hoped the Republicans would go away. And obviously they didn't do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the upper chamber and Obama's ally from Illinois, said the Republicans were to blame for the absence of bipartisanship. ''I think his fate was sealed,'' Durbin said. ''Once the Republicans decided they would close ranks to defeat him, that just made it extremely difficult and dragged it out for a longer period of time. The American people have a limited attention span. Once you convince them there's a problem, they want a solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, though, is among the Democrats who grade Obama harshly for not being more nimble in the face of opposition. ''B-plus, A-minus on substantive accomplishments,'' he told me, ''and a D-plus or C-minus on communication.'' The health care legislation is ''an incredible achievement'' and the stimulus program was ''absolutely, unqualifiedly, enormously successful,'' in Rendell's judgment, yet Obama allowed them to be tarnished by critics. ''They lost the communications battle on both major initiatives, and they lost it early,'' said Rendell, an ardent Hillary Clinton backer who later became an Obama supporter. ''We didn't use the president in either stimulus or health care until we had lost the spin battle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a refrain heard inside the White House as well: it's a communication problem. The first refuge of any politician in trouble is that it's a communication problem, not a policy problem. If only I explained what I was doing better, the people would be more supportive. Which roughly translates to If only you people paid attention, you wouldn't be kicking me upside the head.Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, laughed at the ever-ready assumption that all problems stem from poor communication. ''I haven't been at a policy-problem meeting in 20 months,'' he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy criticism of Obama can be confusing and deeply contradictory -- he is a liberal zealot, in the view of the right; a weak accommodationist, in the view of the left. He is an anticapitalist socialist who is too cozy with Wall Street, a weak-on-defense apologist for America who adopted Bush's unrelenting antiterror tactics at the expense of civil liberties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When he talked about being a transformational president, it was about restoring the faith of the American people in our governing institutions,'' says Ken Duberstein, the former Reagan White House chief of staff who voted for Obama in 2008. ''What we now know is that that did not work. If anything, people are even more dubious about all of our institutions, especially government. So to that extent, the transformational side has not worked. And frankly I would settle these days -- forget about transformational, how about a transactional president, somebody people could do business with? It seems there's an ideological rigidity that the American people did not sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other side would like more ideological rigidity. Norman Solomon, a leading progressive activist and the president of the Institute for Public Accuracy, said Obama has ''totally blown this great opportunity'' to reinvent America by being more aggressive on issues like a public health care option. Other liberals feel the same way about gays in the military or the prison at Guantanamo Bay. ''It's been so reflexive since he was elected, to just give ground and give ground,'' Solomon told me. ''If we don't call him a wimp, which may be the wrong word, he just seems to be backpedaling.'' Solomon added: ''It makes people feel angry and perhaps used. People just feel like, Gee, we really believed in this guy, and his rhetoric is so different than the way he's behaved in office.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pummeled from both sides, Obama clearly seems frustrated and, at times, defensive. At a Labor Day event in Milwaukee, he complained that the special interests treat him badly. ''They're not always happy with me,'' he told supporters. ''They talk about me like a dog -- that's not in my prepared remarks, but it's true.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The friendly fire may bother him even more. ''Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,'' Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. ''If we get an historic health care bill passed -- oh, well, the public option wasn't there. If you get the financial reform bill passed -- then, well, I don't know about this particular derivatives rule, I'm not sure that I'm satisfied with that. And, gosh, we haven't yet brought about world peace. I thought that was going to happen quicker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, it is Obama himself, and not just his supporters, who casts his presidency in grandiose terms. As he pleaded with Democrats for patience at another fund-raiser in Washington two weeks later: ''It took time to free the slaves. It took time for women to get the vote. It took time for workers to get the right to organize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning around the 100-day mark in Obama's administration, the president and his top aides gathered for their morning meeting in the Oval Office. As they waited for David Axelrod, who was running late, someone noted the coming milestone and asked Obama what surprised him most since taking office. ''The number of people who don't pay their taxes,'' he answered sardonically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start, Obama has been surprised by all sorts of challenges that have made it hard for him to govern -- not just the big problems that he knew about, like the economy and the wars, but also the myriad little ones that hindered his progress, like one nominee after another brought down by unpaid taxes. Obama trusted his judgment and seemed to have assumed that impressive people in his own party must have a certain basic sense of integrity -- and that impressive people in the other party must want to work with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the five presidents previous to Obama were governors who came to Washington vowing to fix it, only to realize that Washington defies the easy, and often hollow, rhetoric of change. While Obama was a senator when he set off on the campaign trail, he made the same pledges and has encountered the same reality. ''The story of the first two years is the inherent conflict between a guy who ran from outside to change Washington, gets here and the situation was even worse than we thought it was,'' a senior aide told me. ''Here's a guy who ran as an outsider to change Washington who all of a sudden realized that just to deal with these issues, we were going to have to work with Washington to fix that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama does little to disguise his disdain for Washington and the conventions of modern politics. When he emerges from the Oval Office during the day, aides say, he sometimes pauses before the split-screen television in the outer reception area, soaks in the cable chatter, then shakes his head and walks away. ''He's still never gotten comfortable here,'' a top White House official told me. He has little patience for what Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, calls ''the inevitable theatrics of Washington.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in politics, theater matters, whether it should or not, a lesson Obama keeps relearning, however grudgingly. His decision to redecorate the Oval Office was criticized as an unnecessary luxury in a time of austerity, no matter that it was paid for by private funds. On the campaign trail, he thought it was silly to wear a flag pin, as if that were a measure of his patriotism, until his refusal to wear a flag pin generated distracting criticism and one day he showed up wearing one. Likewise, he thought it was enough to pray in private while living in the White House, and then a poll showed that most Americans weren't sure he's Christian; sure enough, a few weeks later, he attended services at St. John's Church across from Lafayette Square, photographers in tow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama came to office with enormous faith in his own powers of persuasion. He seemed to believe he could overcome divisions if he just sat down with the world's most recalcitrant figures -- whether they be the mullahs in Tehran or the Republicans on Capitol Hill. As it turned out, the candidate who said he would be willing to meet in his first year with some of America's enemies ''without precondition'' has met with none of them. And the president who in his State of the Union address this year promised to meet monthly with leaders of both parties in Congress ended up doing so just half as often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has yet to fully decide whether he is of Washington or apart from it. During the health care debate, Obama had Emanuel cut deals with the pharmaceutical industry, while Axelrod presented the president as above the old business as usual. ''Perhaps we were naive,'' Axelrod told me. ''First, he's always had good relations across party lines. And secondly, I think he believed that in the midst of a crisis you could find partners on the other side of the aisle to help deal with it. I don't think anyone here expected the degree of partisanship that we confronted.'' Emanuel said Republicans adopted a strategy of poisoning the public well. ''Part of what they were doing was not just making us grind it out,'' he told me. ''They were souring the country on the mood of the country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Obama plays the partisan game as well. After months of quiet negotiations, some administration officials thought they were close to a package of new financial regulations with Republican support when, to their chagrin, the White House decided to use the issue to wage a high-profile and politically useful battle with Wall Street special interests. At that point, the chances for a deal across party lines collapsed, administration officials said, and Obama was left to rely almost entirely on Democratic votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama advisers who left the White House recently have been struck how different, and worse, things look from the outside. As he made a round of corporate job interviews after stepping down as White House budget director, Peter Orszag was stunned to discover how deep the gulf between the president and business had become. ''I'd thought it was an 8, but it's more like a 10,'' he told me. ''And rather than wasting time debating whether it's legitimate,'' he added, referring to his former colleagues, ''the key is to recognize that it's affecting what they do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insulation is a curse of every president, but more than any president since Jimmy Carter, Obama comes across as an introvert, someone who finds extended contact with groups of people outside his immediate circle to be draining. He can rouse a stadium of 80,000 people, but that audience is an impersonal monolith; smaller group settings can be harder for him. Aides have learned that it can be good if he has a few moments after a big East Room event so he can gather his energy again. Unlike Clinton, who never met a rope line he did not want to work, Obama does not relish glad-handing. That's what he has Vice President Joe Biden for. When Obama addressed the Business Roundtable this year, he left after his speech without much meet-and-greet, leaving his aides frustrated that he had done himself more harm than good. He is not much for chitchat. When he and I sat down, he started our session matter-of-factly: ''All right,'' he said, ''fire away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts, Obama copes with his political troubles with equanimity. ''Zen'' is the word commonly used in the West Wing. That's not to say he never loses his temper. He has been known to snap at aides when he feels overscheduled. He cuts off advisers who spout information straight from briefing papers with a testy ''I've already read that.'' He does not like it when aides veer out of their assigned lanes, yet they have learned to show up at meetings with an opinion, because he zeroes in on those who stay silent. He was subdued during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, when he found himself largely powerless. Other presidents took refuge at Camp David, but Michelle Obama has told dinner guests that her husband does not care for it all that much, because he is an urban guy. He blows off steam on the White House basketball court. ''Come on, man, you've got to make that shot,'' he chides aides who play with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious sign of strain is in his hair. ''He'll probably be unhappy with me for saying, but I've noticed he's gotten a little grayer,'' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told me over the summer. ''These kinds of decisions do that to people.'' But the stress of the job remains mostly unspoken. ''We usually will talk about writing the condolence letters,'' Gates added. ''But other than that, we don't dwell on it.'' If anything, Obama more often than not bucks up young members of his staff, reminding them that politics, like life, is full of cycles and they will someday be able to tell their children that they were part of something big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Clinton made late-night phone calls around Washington to vent or seek advice, Obama rarely reaches outside the tight group of advisers like Emanuel, Axelrod, Rouse, Messina, Plouffe, Gibbs and Jarrett, as well as a handful of personal friends. ''He's opaque even to us,'' an aide told me. ''Except maybe for a few people in the inner circle, he's a closed book.'' In part because of security, just 15 people have his BlackBerry e-mail address. On long Air Force One flights, he retreats to the conference room and plays spades for hours, maintaining a trash-talking contest all the while, with the same three aides: Reggie Love, his personal assistant; Marvin Nicholson, his trip director; and Pete Souza, his White House photographer. (When I asked if he had an iPad, Obama said, ''I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jarrett attributes Obama's equilibrium to his upbringing. ''He's really different,'' she told me. ''It's rooted in his sense of self and how he grew up with a single mom, living at times on food stamps, working as a community organizer.'' As Gibbs put it: ''He has a remarkable way of focusing on the big picture and the longer term. It's not to say that he's immune from criticism. But he can categorize in his head the difference between what's a setback, what's a bump along the way and what's just noise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is certainly no shortage of noise. But as Obama gets back on the campaign trail, aides have noticed his old spirit again. He particularly enjoys the so-called backyard sessions on the lawns of supporters. ''That's the happiest I've seen him in a long time,'' an aide said. After one, Obama told the aide, ''This reminds me of Iowa on the bus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nostalgia for the good old days of the campaign afflicts any White House in trouble. After all, those were the romantic moments when all was possible, when tens of thousands of people would gather in Grant Park to tear up over the promise of what will be. But in sober moments, Obama understands how selective the memories really are. ''The mythology has emerged somehow that we ran this flawless campaign, I never made a mistake, that we were master communicators, everything worked in lock step,'' he told me. ''And somehow now, as president, things are messy and they don't always work as planned and people are mad at us. That's not how I look at stuff, because I remember what the campaign was like. And it was just as messy and just as difficult. And there were all sorts of moments when our supporters lost hope, and it looked like we weren't going to win. And we're going through that same period here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In covering the last three presidents, I have watched as each has been tested, albeit in very different circumstances -- Clinton's impeachment over false testimony under oath about an affair with a White House intern, Bush's drive to begin a war that would drag on for years at enormous cost and Obama's struggle to turn around the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They are starkly variable crises, but some dynamics are familiar: presidents who live and die by polls insist they are not important when they fall; they argue that they are focused on principle, not politics, when it's almost always a mixture of both; they acknowledge difficulties but say they will pass; they portray themselves as courageous when flying against public opinion; they complain that the news media distort the situation and fuel division; they blame their opponents for practicing the politics of destruction and obstruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talking with Obama and his aides, it's eerie to hear echoes of Clinton and Bush. Obama says the easy issues never make it to him, only the hard ones; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says our war with terrorists will never end in a surrender ceremony; Bush often said the same thing. Obama says he does not want to kick problems down the road; Bush often said the same thing. In the days leading up to the 1994 midterm elections, Clinton mocked Republicans for promising to balance the budget while cutting taxes, saying, ''They're not serious.'' In our conversation, Obama used some variation of the phrase ''they're not serious'' four times in referring to Republican budget plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not to say the three men are alike; indeed, they are vastly different. But putting ideology aside, Obama at times seems to be a cross between his two predecessors. Like Clinton, he digs into the intellectual underpinnings of a policy decision, studying briefing books and seeking a range of opinions. Some aides express frustration that he can leave decisions unresolved for too long. But like Bush, once he has made a decision, Obama rarely revisits it. And like Bush, he runs a pretty disciplined operation; he started our interview a half-hour ahead of schedule, just as Bush sometimes did. Clinton, on the other hand, still runs on Clinton Standard Time. Just a few weeks ago, he was more than six hours late for a scheduled interview with another journalist. One constant among all three: It took Clinton and Bush some time to really grow into the presidency, until they wore it comfortably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Obama looks to the experiences of Clinton and Reagan, who both rebounded from midterm debacles to win re-election, the lessons differ. In Reagan's case, the House was already in Democratic hands, so during his first two years, he forged coalitions of Republicans and conservative Democrats. After the opposition was strengthened in the 1982 elections, that was no longer viable, and Reagan began working more with Democratic leaders. Clinton likewise changed course after the 1994 elections, emphasizing more incremental, piece-by-piece change rather than sweeping proposals and pursuing goals like welfare reform and balanced budgets when he could agree with Newt Gingrich's new majority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinton, though, was more instinctively centrist than Obama is, and his revival owed much to other factors, particularly his leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing and his budget standoff with Gingrich during the partial government shutdown. Some argue Obama might be better off with at least one Republican chamber so he too has a foil as Clinton did. But it is unclear if Obama is as agile a politician as Reagan or Clinton. ''He's no Bill Clinton when it comes to having the ability to move and to wiggle,'' says Joe Gaylord, a top Gingrich adviser. ''I find rigidity in Obama that comes from his life in liberalism.'' Ken Duberstein likewise doubts Obama's capacity for adjustment. ''They're much better at the art of campaigning than the art of governing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the more important historical pattern to consider is this one: The last four presidents who failed to win a second term were all challenged in their own party. Lyndon Johnson was driven out of the race in 1968 after nearly losing the New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy. Gerald Ford fended off Reagan in 1976 but went on to lose the general election to Carter, who likewise had to beat a primary challenger four years later, Ted Kennedy, before falling to Reagan. And George H. W. Bush had to overcome Patrick Buchanan before losing to Clinton in 1992.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is a high priority for Obama to prevent any intraparty fight in 2012, and to date, despite the fire from the left, no serious challenger appears on the horizon. Putting Hillary Clinton in the cabinet may turn out to be one of Obama's smartest moves, because it not only eliminated her as a would-be challenger, but it also should presumably squelch the will-she-or-won't-she speculation that otherwise would have played out for months. (Instead, the guessing game has her replacing Biden on the ticket, however fanciful that might be.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the first African-American president, Obama is more aware than most of the limits of looking back. But he also has read enough presidential biographies to know he is not the first to encounter rocky times. ''History never precisely repeats itself,'' Obama told me. ''But there is a pattern in American presidencies -- at least modern presidencies. You come in with excitement and fanfare. The other party initially, having been beaten, says it wants to cooperate with you. You start implementing your program as you promised during the campaign. The other party pushes back very hard. It causes a lot of consternation and drama in Washington. People who are already cynical and skeptical about Washington generally look at it and say, This is the same old mess we've seen before. The president's poll numbers drop. And you have to then sort of wrestle back the confidence of the people as the programs that you've put in place start bearing fruit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To better understand history, and his role in it, Obama invited a group of presidential scholars to dinner in May in the living quarters of the White House. Obama was curious about, among other things, the Tea Party movement. Were there precedents for this sort of backlash against the establishment? What sparked them and how did they shape American politics? The historians recalled the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Populists in the 1890s and Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s. ''He listened,'' the historian H. W. Brands told me. ''What he concluded, I don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama's conclusions are still being formed. He has learned that ''Washington is even more broken than we thought,'' as one aide put it. He has trusted his own judgment as he disregarded advisers who told him to scale back health care at various stages. And he has found that his vaunted speaking skills are not enough to change the dynamics of governance. ''One of the lessons he has to learn is What is the best form of communication for him with the American people,'' the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin told me. ''He's so good in front of an audience, and I get the sense that he needs the energy off the audience. And so speaking to television cameras doesn't really do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we talked in the Oval Office, Obama acknowledged that the succession of so many costly initiatives, necessary as they may have been, wore on the public. ''That accumulation of numbers on the TV screen night in and night out in those first six months I think deeply and legitimately troubled people,'' he told me. ''They started feeling like: Gosh, here we are tightening our belts, we're cutting out restaurants, we're cutting out our gym membership, in some cases we're not buying new clothes for the kids. And here we've got these folks in Washington who just seem to be printing money and spending it like nobody's business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And it reinforced the narrative that the Republicans wanted to promote anyway, which was Obama is not a different kind of Democrat -- he's the same old tax-and-spend liberal Democrat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emanuel told me that the cascading crises in Obama's early days exacted a lasting toll. ''The seeds of his political difficulty today were planted in taking those steps,'' he said. White House officials largely agree they should not have let the health care process drag out while waiting for Republican support that would never come. ''It's not what people felt they sent Barack Obama to Washington to do, to be legislator in chief,'' a top adviser told me. ''It lent itself to the perception that he wasn't doing anything on the economy.'' Plouffe agreed that guilt by association with Democratic lawmakers did not help. ''When you swim in those waters, you're going to be affected by that,'' he said. ''I do think he's paid a political price, somewhat, for having to be tied to Congress.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for all the second-guessing, what you do not hear in the White House is much questioning of the basic elements of the program -- Obama aides, liberal and moderate alike, reject complaints from the right that the stimulus did not help the economy or that health care expands government too much, as well as complaints from the left that he should have pushed for a bigger stimulus package or held out for a public health care option. ''We asked for more stimulus than we ended up with,'' Larry Summers, the outgoing national economics adviser, told me. ''But we fought as hard as we could, and I believe we got as much as Congress was ever going to give us at that time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they argue that any mistakes affected things only at the margins. ''There's all this talk in this town -- if we had done energy before health care, if we had focused more on small business, if we had done an Oval on the economy instead of Iraq, we would be doing better,'' Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, says. ''I don't believe that. We could always do things differently, and there are plenty of things I wish I had back. But I don't know they'd change the overall trend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melody Barnes, the president's domestic-policy adviser, says the biggest problem was that after eight years of Bush, Obama's supporters were very eager to change everything right away. ''The pent-up demand across every issue area -- around science, around education, around health care, immigration, you name it -- there was a lot of desire to finally get these things done,'' she told me. ''Every segment of the population had something that was very important to them that they really wanted to put over the finish line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama is preaching patience in an impatient age. One prominent Democratic lawmaker told me Obama's problem is that he is not insecure -- he always believes he is the smartest person in any room and never feels the sense of panic that makes a good politician run scared all the time, frenetically wooing lawmakers, power brokers, adversaries and voters as if the next election were a week away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, what you hear Obama aides talking about is that the system is ''not on the level.'' That's a phrase commonly used around the West Wing -- ''it's not on the level.'' By that, they mean the Republicans, the news media, the lobbyists, the whole Washington culture is not serious about solving problems. The challenge, as they see it, is how to rise above a town that can obsess for a week on whether an obscure Agriculture Department official in Georgia should have been fired. At the same time, as Emanuel told me, ''We have to play the game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Brands, the historian, put it, ''It'll be really interesting to see if a president who is thinking long term can have an impact on a political system that is almost irredeemably short term in its perspective.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd rather be a really good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president.'' So Obama told Diane Sawyer of ABC News last January at another low point, just after the Republican Scott Brown captured the Massachusetts Senate seat held for decades by Ted Kennedy, costing Democrats their filibuster-proof control of the upper chamber and jeopardizing the president's health care plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a good line, but it's one of those things easier said in the first or second year of a presidency. By the third, it starts to become an actual choice. Forks in the road require a president to decide if he will advance ideas that will genuinely change the country even if deeply unpopular or if he will opt instead for a safer route that does not put re-election at risk. Obama aides like to argue that he has already demonstrated willingness to put aside politics by bailing out the banks and automakers, decisions that he saw as critical to preventing greater economic catastrophe (and that ultimately cost taxpayers far less than initially feared).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But would he jeopardize re-election absent an immediate crisis? The choice may confront him soon after the midterms when his bipartisan fiscal commission reports back by Dec. 1 with plans to tame the national deficit with a politically volatile menu of unpalatable options, like scaling back Medicare and Social Security while raising taxes. Obama also anticipates putting immigration reform, another divisive issue fraught with political danger, back on the table. ''If the question is, Over the next two years do I take a pass on tough stuff,'' he told me, ''the answer is no.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama's aides say they will most likely set up their re-election campaign around next March, roughly the same as when Bush and Clinton incorporated their incumbent campaign operations. They are more optimistic about 2012 than they are about 2010, believing the Tea Party will re-elect Barack Obama by pulling the Republican nominee to the right. They doubt Sarah Palin will run and figure Mitt Romney cannot get the Republican nomination because he enacted his own health care program in Massachusetts. If they had to guess today, some in the White House say that Obama will find himself running against Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that campaign on the horizon, Obama asked Pete Rouse and Jim Messina to begin thinking about the next phase of his presidency, not just personnel but also priorities and message. Never mind that Rouse was among those who wanted to leave -- for years, he has been saying he wanted out of politics but never says no to Obama. Indeed, when Rouse told colleagues he wanted to leave the White House by the end of this year, Messina bet him $400 that he would not. ''We'll see what happens,'' Rouse told me when I asked about the bet last month. Then Obama made Rouse interim chief of staff. Rouse initially resisted moving into Rahm Emanuel's corner suite until colleagues threatened to move his files for him. Messina jokes that Rouse will turn off the Oval Office lights after eight years and before assuming his new job, running Obama's presidential library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rouse is managing a slow-motion White House shuffle. By year's end, there will be a new chief of staff, a new national-economics adviser, a new budget director, a new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a new national-security adviser, among others. Axelrod and Messina expect to leave by spring to set up Obama's re-election effort, and Plouffe will almost certainly come into the White House in a senior role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal communication, encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative,'' said one aide familiar with the discussions led by Rouse and Messina. Obama has been aggravated by friction among his advisers. ''He's a little frustrated with the internal dysfunction,'' the aide said. ''He doesn't like confrontation.'' But his initial choices to fill open slots have been drawn largely from his administration, suggesting more continuity than change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rouse and Messina see areas for possible bipartisan agreement, like reauthorizing the nation's education laws to include reform measures favored by centrists and conservatives, passing long-pending trade pacts and possibly even producing scaled-back energy legislation. ''You'll hear more about exports and less about public spending,'' a senior White House official said. ''You'll hear more about initiative and private sector and less about the Department of Energy. You'll hear more about government as a financier and less about government as a hirer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama expressed optimism to me that he could make common cause with Republicans after the midterm elections. ''It may be that regardless of what happens after this election, they feel more responsible,'' he said, ''either because they didn't do as well as they anticipated, and so the strategy of just saying no to everything and sitting on the sidelines and throwing bombs didn't work for them, or they did reasonably well, in which case the American people are going to be looking to them to offer serious proposals and work with me in a serious way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked if there were any Republicans he trusted enough to work with on economic issues. The first name he came up with was Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who initially agreed to serve as Obama's commerce secretary before changing his mind. But Gregg is retiring. The only other Republican named by Obama was Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who has put together a detailed if politically problematic blueprint for reducing federal spending. The two men are ideologically poles apart, but perhaps Obama sees a bit of himself in a young, substantive policy thinker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if such an alliance emerges, though, the next two years will be mostly about cementing what Obama did in his first two years -- and defending it against challenges in Congress and the courts. ''Even if I had the exact same Congress, even if we don't lose a seat in the Senate and we don't lose a seat in the House, I think the rhythms of the next two years would inevitably be different from the rhythms of the first two years,'' Obama told me. ''There's going to be a lot of work in this administration just doing things right and making sure that new laws are stood up in the ways they're intended.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a senior adviser put it, ''There's going to be very little incentive for big things over the next two years unless there's some sort of crisis.'' Yet Obama and his aides still scorn Bill Clinton's small-bore approach. ''It's fair to assume you're not going to see school uniforms play a big role in the next two years,'' Plouffe told me. ''His view is you can't spend two years playing four-corners.'' Before he left, Emanuel told me: ''I'm not of the view that you do nothing. I think you've got to have an agenda.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what sort of agenda? Not as sweeping and not as provocative, say some advisers. ''It will have to be limited and focused on the things that are achievable and high priorities for the American people,'' Dick Durbin told me. Tom Daschle said Obama would have to reach out to adversaries. ''The lessons of the last two years are going to be critical,'' he told me. ''The key word is 'inclusion.' He's got to find ways to be inclusive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rendell thinks otherwise. ''Don't care so much about bipartisanship if the Republicans continue to refuse to cooperate,'' he advised. ''Do what you have to do. Fight back.'' At the same time, he said, stop moaning about what he inherited: ''After the election, I'd say no more pointing back, no more blaming the Bush administration. It's O.K. to do that during the campaign and then stop. But to do it as much as we do it, it sounds like a broken record. And after two years, you own it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama will own it for another two years, or six if he can find his way forward. As an author, Obama appreciates the rhythms of a tumultuous story. But who is the protagonist, really? At bottom, this president is still a mystery to many Americans. During the campaign, he sold himself -- or the idea of himself -- more than any particular policy, and voters filled in the lines as they chose. He was, as he said at the time, the ultimate Rorschach test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the lines are being filled in further. With each choice Obama makes, he further defines himself for better or worse in Americans' minds. He says he knows where he is going and is gathering momentum despite the hurdles ahead. As he told a group of visitors during the week last spring that Congress passed health care and his administration reached agreement on an arms-control treaty with Russia, ''I start slow, but I finish strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He will have to, if the history he is writing is to turn out the way he prefers.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huang Kexue, federal authorities say, is a new kind of spy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For five years, Mr. Huang was a scientist at a <span class="companylink">Dow Chemical</span> lab in Indiana, studying ways to improve insecticides. But before he was fired in 2008, Mr. Huang began sharing Dow's secrets with Chinese researchers, authorities say, then obtained grants from a state-run foundation in China with the goal of starting a rival business there.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Huang, who was born in China and is a legal United States resident, faces a rare criminal charge -- that he engaged in economic espionage on China's behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law enforcement officials say the kind of spying Mr. Huang is accused of represents a new front in the battle for a global economic edge. As China and other countries broaden their efforts to obtain Western technology, American industries beyond the traditional military and high-tech targets risk having valuable secrets exposed by their own employees, court records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than relying on dead drops and secret directions from government handlers, the new trade in business secrets seems much more opportunistic, federal prosecutors say, and occurs in loose, underground markets throughout the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors say it is difficult to prove links to a foreign government, but intelligence officials say China, Russia and Iran are among the countries pushing hardest to obtain the latest technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the new global economy, our businesses are increasingly targets for theft,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's criminal division. ''In order to stay a leader in innovation, we've got to protect these trade secrets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huang, 45, who says he is not guilty, is being prosecuted under an economic espionage provision in use for only the seventh time. Created by Congress in 1996 to address a shift toward industrial spying after the cold war, the law makes it a crime to steal business trade secrets, like software code and laboratory breakthroughs. The crime rises to espionage if the thefts are carried out to help a foreign government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic espionage charges are also pending against Jin Hanjuan, a software engineer for <span class="companylink">Motorola</span>, who was arrested with a laptop full of company documents while boarding a plane for China, prosecutors said. Over the last year, other charges involving the theft of trade secrets -- a charge less serious than espionage -- have been filed against former engineers from General Motors and Ford who had business ties to China. And scientists at the <span class="companylink">DuPont Company</span> and <span class="companylink">Valspar</span>, a Minnesota paint company, recently pleaded guilty to stealing their employer's secrets after taking jobs in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two past espionage cases involving American computer companies, defendants said they saw a chance to make money and acted on their own, knowing that the information would be valuable to Chinese companies or agencies. In several cases, Chinese government agencies or scientific institutes provided money to start businesses or research to develop the ideas; that financing is what gave rise to the espionage charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, appointed by Congress to study the national security issues arising from America's economic relationship with China, said in a report last year that even in instances without direct involvement by Chinese officials, China's government ''has been a major beneficiary of technology acquired through industrial espionage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has denied that its intelligence services go after American industries. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the subject, but spokesmen for the Chinese foundation and the university that worked with Mr. Huang said they were not aware of any espionage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it's true, we will start our own investigation into it,'' said Chen Yue, a spokesman for the Natural Science Foundation of China, which gave Mr. Huang grants to conduct research there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American officials and corporate trade groups say they fear economic spying will increase as China's quest for Western know-how spreads from military systems to everyday commercial technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After focusing for decades on low-cost assembly operations, China ''feels it really needs to turn the corner and become a technology power in its own right,'' said James Mulvenon, the director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis in Washington, which tracks Chinese activities for federal agencies and corporate clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mulvenon said China is trying to woo back thousands of ethnic Chinese scientists who have trained or worked in the United States. ''They basically roll out the red carpet for these guys,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As economic crimes become easier to commit -- in some cases as simple as downloading data and pressing ''Send'' -- security analysts say some American companies must share the blame for thefts because they do not adequately monitor employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Motorola</span>, for example, court records show that Ms. Jin, the software engineer, downloaded company documents during two sick leaves and tapped into the company's computers from China, where, prosecutors say, she met with a company linked to the Chinese military. Ms. Jin, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in China, says she is not guilty, and is awaiting trial in Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catching and prosecuting wrongdoers is also made difficult by the refusal of some companies to report breaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have public companies with their stock values tied to their assets, the last thing they want the buyer of that stock to think is that their assets are compromised,'' said Michael Maloof, the chief technology officer of TriGeo Network Security, a company that provides computer monitoring systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first economic espionage case, filed in 2001 against a Japanese scientist, collapsed when Japan refused to extradite him. The six other cases have involved China, and the Justice Department won the first three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one case, two Silicon Valley engineers admitted to stealing secrets about computer chips, then arranging financing from Chinese government agencies to start business. In another case, a retired <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> engineer was convicted after a search of his home found documents on United States military and space programs, as well as letters from Chinese aviation officials seeking the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department lost a case involving two California engineers. The government focused on documents showing that the engineers were working with a venture capitalist in China to seek financing for a microchip business from China's 863 program, which supports development of technologies with military applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the men were arrested before they filed the grant application. The judge in the case concluded in May that the government had needed to prove that the men had ''intended to confer a benefit'' on China, ''not receive a benefit from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Huang's case, according to the indictment, he had received money from the Natural Science Foundation of China, a government organization, to conduct insecticide research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huang grew up in China, and has lived in the United States or Canada since 1995. While working for Dow's farm chemicals unit, <span class="companylink">Dow AgroSciences</span>, he also took a job as a visiting professor at a Chinese university and made eight trips to China, court records show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides directing research at the university while at Dow, he later smuggled samples of a bacterial strain from Dow to China in his son's suitcase, the authorities said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huang's lawyer, Michael Donahoe, said at a recent hearing that the case was ''hypothetical.'' But Cynthia Ridgeway, an assistant United States attorney, said that with Dow's Chinese patent due to expire in 2012, Mr. Huang had ''the full recipe'' needed to try to take its business to China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a judge denied Mr. Huang's request for bail. He is awaiting trial in federal custody in Indiana.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN if you are never embroiled in a lawsuit, life events set off legal issues. Vast bodies of law affect milestones like buying or selling a home, being fired, starting a business, getting divorced and losing a loved one, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern about being held hostage to high hourly rates and a running meter causes many consumers to put off getting advice until they are already in legal hot water. This deters people from getting the sort of help that could minimize legal problems or prevent them altogether. And sometimes life intervenes with a legal emergency -- like when a young adult child gets picked up for shoplifting, possession of drugs or driving while intoxicated.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each time such occasions arise, you may ask, ''What's it going to cost if I consult a lawyer?'' These days, a flagging economy and new technology could make it more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers have ''an obsession with a bespoke way of delivering legal services,'' as if they were offering hand-tailored suits, said Richard E. Susskind, a professor at Gresham College in London and author of ''The End of Lawyers? Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services (Oxford University Press, revised this year).'' Yet increasingly, technology is leading to ''the commoditization of legal services'' as law firms automate a growing number of functions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This trend gives clients the bargaining power to negotiate about both the way they work with lawyers and the way these professionals charge, Professor Susskind said. Here is how to use that muscle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOK FOR A PRO Pressure on law firms to become more efficient is leading to the decline of the jack-of-all-trades, said Gary A. Munneke, a professor at Pace University Law School in White Plains and an expert in legal practice management. ''As we move toward a world of specialists, you can reap substantial cost savings by matching your legal needs with someone who concentrates on a particular area of the law, whether it's real estate, bankruptcy or divorce.'' And ''the more generic their services are, the more price sensitive they will be,'' Professor Munneke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In certain fields there are even subspecialists, who charge premium rates but may be able to handle your matter so quickly that you still come out ahead. For example, the pool of trust and estate lawyers includes experts in the generation-skipping transfer tax, special needs trusts and protecting assets from creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAP UNDERVALUED TALENT Contractions in the legal work force can be your gain, as well-trained young or midcareer lawyers cast off by big firms hang out their shingles, said John W. Toothman, president of the Devil's Advocate, a legal fee consulting firm in Great Falls, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These lawyers keep overhead low by sharing space with bigger firms or renting no-frills space near the government offices where public records must be filed. For certain matters, city dwellers can reap additional savings by seeking out small-town lawyers, whose rates are far below those of their urban or suburban counterparts. Sure, there is some cachet to having your prenuptial agreement prepared by the same lawyer who is handling a celebrity divorce, but is that what you really need?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might have to do a little digging to find the hidden gems. Referrals from local bar associations are one possibility. Better yet, speak to members of your community, including clergy, tax advisers and leaders of civic groups. Some of the best leads may come from people with similar issues who have been pleased with the service they received -- assuming you can trust them to guard your privacy, if that's an issue, Mr. Toothman said. For example, a parent whose child has a disability and is concerned about the school's obligation to make accommodations might find a kindred spirit through the local PTA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRAL FEES Most lawyers charge an hourly rate, which gives them an incentive to run up the tab and can lead to sticker shock when the bill arrives. For routine matters, like preparing a will or a simple contract, you can ask for a flat fee, which also enables you to bid your work to multiple firms and negotiate a lump-sum price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the lawyer has no idea how long things will take, you'll have no choice but to pay by the hour -- for example, for negotiating a contract or a severance package. But here too, you can control costs by setting a cap on what you'll spend and being clear about expectations. ''Lawyers can go to town and negotiate every little thing,'' Mr. Toothman said. It is up to you to say something to the effect of ''I don't need every possible clause in this lease.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having the lawyer coach you backstage, rather than appearing on the front line, is sometimes a great way to cut costs and keep dealings low-key. Unless you're totally tongue-tied, this might work well in severance negotiations or in completing the terms of a home sale, for instance. You'll probably want to involve the lawyer more visibly when the other side brings in its lawyer or when the legal principles are complex. There are also times when it would strengthen your bargaining power to have someone do the talking for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BE TASK-ORIENTED Before you start working together, discuss what needs to be done, and the most cost-effective way to perform each item on the list, Professor Susskind said. Question the lawyer closely to determine which tasks can be done by a paralegal, by a computer or through your own effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, there can be an enormous amount of paperwork involved in settling an estate after a death, and much of it doesn't call for a lawyer's expertise. Bit by bit, and as you feel up to it, you can cut down on costs enormously by doing most of the legwork yourself. This includes getting valuables appraised, sending documentation to financial institutions and filing claims for any life insurance or Social Security survivor's benefits to which you are entitled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, you would be wise to pay an expert by the hour to guide you through the process of retitling and transferring any retirement assets you have inherited. The rules are complex, and one misstep could erase valuable tax benefits.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- Few issues have inspired as much voter anger this campaign season, or as many caustic campaign commercials, as the issue of jobs and how to put Americans back to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while candidates in Congressional races have mostly offered broad-brush proposals, the country's governors-to-be have been busy outlining specific policies to reshape the economy one job at a time.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats and Republicans in the 37 races for governor this year have published economic plans that for all their differences share what experts describe as a significant shift: public investment, government support and education are all likely to become less one-size-fits-all, and more focused on the dorm-room dreams of budding entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Candidates for governor across party and state lines, including Alex Sink, the Democratic nominee in Florida, and Terry Branstad, the Republican running in Iowa, say they will shift tax credits and other state resources to start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retraining may have been the mantra a decade ago, but now, proposals linking education with economics focus more on teaching business to all ages -- from kindergartners to graduate students to grandparents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And government, many future governors now say, must become more agile and responsive to business. Corporate regulations would be eased or eliminated by candidates from both parties in California, Pennsylvania and several other states, while plans to simply create connections among employers, state government, other nations, venture capitalists and universities are being promoted by candidates across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a new game, a new playbook,'' said Bruce Katz, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. ''If you want to play globally today, you better get very specific very fast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, he added, ''governors keep getting more and more focused, and more and more deliberate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States acting as policy incubators, of course, is not a 21st-century invention. The New Deal and Reaganomics grew from governorships, and in the 1980s, Rust Belt states like Indiana and Pennsylvania pioneered a new approach to economic development with expanded financial incentives and public-private partnerships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, predictable ideology is still part of the mix -- more Democrats are pushing investments in infrastructure, and more Republicans want broad tax cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of financial struggle for many states, incoming governors now seem determined to create new models that combine evolving versions of the old with novel ideas -- almost anything that might work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More than any other time since 1982, you will have governors with a clean slate,'' said Timothy P. McNulty, a former economic advisor to Tom Ridge, the Republican governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001. ''I don't think anyone could tell you they know exactly the recipe of economic policies that make sense for this period. We're going into a reinvention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are three strategies that candidates are championing -- and what to watch out for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax Breaks for Jobs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nurturing New Employers That Will Stick Around and Grow</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At various points during the recession, Rhode Island had the country's highest unemployment rate. So when Frank Caprio, the Democratic nominee for governor, put together his economic plan, he decided to include an incentive -- a finder's fee -- to encourage the time-honored practice of business networking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Business Finder Tax Credit, as Mr. Caprio calls it, would provide a $1,000 tax credit for any company that helped recruit a business to Rhode Island; a $10,000 credit shared between those two businesses if more than 20 jobs are created; and a waiver for the corporate filing fee for any business that adds a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is one of the more novel proposals from candidates seeking to tilt the tax code toward new jobs or new businesses. In the 1980s, '90s and '00s, states often tailored incentives to specific industries, like biotech or manufacturers, that sometimes left a few years later for a better deal. Now, incoming governors are focusing on small businesses that are more likely to stick around and grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Iowa, for example, Mr. Branstad, the Republican, would allow start-up businesses to operate free of state income tax for their first three years. He would further sweeten the pot by allowing start-ups to avoid paying state sales tax in their first three years, for up to $50,000 in taxable purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other candidates are proposing similar ideas, but with an approach best described as tax-cuts-per-hire. Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, a Democrat running for re-election, has already established a $5,000 credit for any company that hires an unemployed state resident. Bill Brady, the Republican candidate in a tight race in Illinois, is proposing a $3,750 ''jump-start tax credit'' for business owners, paid over two years for every new job created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Ms. Sink, the Florida Democrat, has included in her economic plan a tax credit tied to the growth of payrolls. It would let new companies defer state corporate income taxes for the first three years, with bigger credits going to firms that add higher-paying jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm hoping this will give businesses some confidence and give them something extra to help their bottom line,'' Ms. Sink said in an interview. ''But it's also for remaking our economy and creating some diversification.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINE PRINT:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broadest tax cuts could have a high price tag. Experts also point out that corporate credits with strict qualifications are rarely used (the case so far in Maryland), while loosely defined credits yield low returns because ''businesses label things how they want to,'' said David Osborne, author of ''Reinventing Government'' and a former advisor to several governors and former Vice President Al Gore. Does a temporary position amount to a job? What is the definition of a start-up? ''Companies cheat,'' Mr. Osborne said, ''and accountants help them do it legally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Business Roles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privatization and Consolidation As Ways to Recast Development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Gov. James A. Rhodes of Ohio, a Republican, started the Development Department in the early 1960s to revive his state's economy, it was an aggressive operation with a staff that included his Rhodes Raiders -- state salesmen who showed up without appointments at companies in other states that the governor hoped to lure to Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two generations later, the department has expanded its mission to include home-heating assistance and support for the homeless, which is what the Republican candidate, John Kasich, wants to change. He has pledged to replace the government-run agency with JobsOhio, a new nonprofit corporation, with an all-chief executive board of directors -- ''an important asset for selling the state at the highest levels,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And privatizing the agency would make it more nimble, argues Mr. Kasich, a former managing director for <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. The civil service requirements would be eliminated, making it easier to fire agency workers who are not performing. And if Ohio wanted to use a private jet to fly a chief executive to a potential site, JobsOhio could quickly make it happen. As the Kasich campaign puts it, ''the days of trying to connect businesses through bureaucrats is over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Branstad, the Iowa Republican, has proposed a similar change, following the path of Indiana, Pennsylvania and a handful of other states. And even for those who are not promoting privatization, consolidation is a major theme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Snyder, the Michigan Republican running for governor and a venture capitalist who has campaigned as ''one tough nerd,'' and John Hickenlooper, a brewpub entrepreneur and former mayor of Denver who is Colorado's Democratic nominee, have both said that they want to streamline state programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several candidates from both parties have also said that they would create positions specifically to help small businesses, or in the case of Jerry Brown, the California Democrat, a ''jobs czar'' specifically for clean energy. Many more have emphasized a need for economic development officials to become more welcoming and more international, and to expand their presence on the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINE PRINT:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts identify two risks to economic development overhauls. The first is that the changes not go far enough, and instead create jobs for campaign donors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The danger is that you fall into an 'I gotta have a program' mentality instead of really engaging with people who are trying to start companies and see how they do it,'' said Mr. McNulty, the Pennsylvania economic adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second risk is that elevating chief executives means limiting other perspectives: government of the people could become government for corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There needs to be a public voice on economic development issues,'' said Richard Celeste, Ohio's governor from 1983 to 1991. ''The notion that you can privatize that public voice is absolute nonsense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Synergy for the Campus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linking Universities and Entrepreneurs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can putting new businesses closer to universities -- or financing them with public money -- help create another <span class="companylink">Google</span>?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor in California and a former chief executive of <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, is one of at least a dozen candidates with that idea. It is not a radical thought, considering that some of the most successful job creation policies of the last few decades have come from partnerships among government, colleges and businesses, according to experts. Pennsylvania's Ben Franklin Technology Partners, they say, is a model of how to help fledgling companies grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many incoming governors are looking to tighten the bond between education and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are pushing to apply business concepts to public education, either with new curricula focused on innovation, or by shutting down schools that fail and tying teachers' pay to student achievement -- a proposal from Mr. Snyder in Michigan, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are pushing in the other direction, too: directing universities to become incubators for new companies, and directing community colleges to give students skills for hard-to-fill jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Whitman, for one, would create ''economic opportunity zones'' at the state's universities, with incentives for companies that take root near campuses. Mr. Snyder wants laid-off auto workers to be taught how to start businesses of their own, while Mr. Branstad, who was governor of Iowa from 1983 to 1999 before becoming the president of Des Moines University, has said he wants to create an ''entrepreneurial mindset'' in every grade, starting as early as kindergarten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also broad support for continuing or expanding the various public-private venture capital funds that have sprung up across the country to finance start-ups, especially in life sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Onorato, the Democrat running for governor in Pennsylvania, has proposed a new pool of competitive funding for university research, in addition to increased support for the Ben Franklin Partners, and what he calls the Pennsylvania 100, a group of entrepreneurs-in-residence at the state's most promising research labs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FINE PRINT:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's all about commitment: If forced to pick from their pool of ideas, what will this year's group of incoming governors choose? Tax credits and cuts tend to be the first item listed in their economic plans, partly because they are an easier sell politically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of these other proposals -- reinventing education; using public money to finance start-ups, many of which will fail; trying to shift from a manufacturing to an information-based economy, one small company at a time -- require perseverance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some candidates acknowledge that staying focused on start-ups will be challenging because the number of jobs each creates will be small. ''We're talking about two-sies and three-sies and 10-sies instead of thousands at a time,'' said Ms. Sink in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne, whose latest book is ''The Price of Government: Getting the Results We Need in the Age of Permanent Fiscal Crisis,'' said, ''Since the '80s it's been a tug of war between political impulses and pragmatic impulses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''This battle is two steps forward, one step back.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something odd showed up last week in the mailbox of Choire Sicha, a veteran blogger who lost his job and started a Web site with a few pals two years ago: a paycheck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2008, Mr. Sicha, Alex Balk and David Cho all found themselves laid off from Radar, the on-again-off-again magazine and Web site. Confronted by the headwinds of a growing media recession, they decided to hand-crank a future by starting their own site.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you were going to assemble a business plan for a Web site, you would look closely at everything The Awl (theawl.com) did and then head in precisely the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is that name for one thing -- both ancient and fusty with the bonus of being hard to pronounce. An awl is a pointy tool used to make marks on wood. Catchy, huh?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the site itself. In an age of hyper-targeted vertical sites, The Awl is all over the road. In the last week, the site published a column about foreclosures, a piece describing what it feels like to be chided by Gene Simmons, an illustrated essay on the virtues of the breaststroke, tips on picking up obnoxious hipster girls and yes, poetry in the, yes, poetry section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Neither of us have particularly good histories of working for other people, our prospects were grim, and so we decided that we would make the kind of site people we know would like to read,'' Mr. Sicha said of Mr. Balk and himself. Strong voices and a literate sensibility made The Awl an attractive, sticky place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By August 2009, they had chewed through their savings and had just under 100,000 unique visitors a month, a nice number that was rich with media insiders and hip twentysomethings, but not the kind of traffic that would make a living. When an anonymous donor sent in a few hundred dollars at one particularly stretched-thin moment, Mr. Sicha used it to buy food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a funny thing happened on the way to obscurity. A year later, that number had grown to almost a half a million, according to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Analytics. Revenue for the year will surpass $200,000. The site has spawned a funny sibling site, Splitsider (splitsider.com), and on Monday, a sister site aimed at women, The Hairpin (thehairpin.com) joins the family, with its start-up financed by Ann Taylor, the women's fashion brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than hiring writers and building out various verticals that are then federated into a business, The Awl is finding specific writers it likes and then going into partnership with them. Splitsider is partly owned by Adam Frucci, who used to work at Gawker Media's gadget blog, Gizmodo, and The Hairpin's partner will be Edith Zimmerman, most recently of New York magazine's Vulture blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very idea of a little digital boutique flies in the face of all manner of conventional wisdom, chief of which is that scale is all that matters in an era of commoditized advertising sales. The Awl is attempting to tunnel under those efforts by building a low-cost site that delivers a certain kind of content for a certain kind of audience. And the owners don't have to get rich -- The Awl has no investors -- they just have to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm surprised that there aren't a lot of independent, owner-operated editorial Web sites out there,'' Mr. Sicha said. ''We will be two years old in April, and we are self-sufficient and stable. That's pretty fast.'' (Disclosure moment: I know Mr. Sicha socially in a New York media sort of way, and he has written for The New York Times in the past. The mysterious Mr. Balk, who is never interviewed for quotation, not so much.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Awl confronts the tyranny of small numbers in an age when Web behemoths, like Gawker Media and The Huffington Post, get most of the attention. A lot of ad agencies don't want to deal with any sites under a million unique visitors, and many brands are not necessarily interested in cutting deals with boutique Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the job of Mr. Cho, a veteran of College Humor and Radar, to solve this, which he's done in part by cutting sponsorship deals with Ann Taylor, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> Search Terms, <span class="companylink">Kia Motors</span>, Gillette and Merge Records. Those deals mean The Awl is no longer solely dependent on selling display ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without a doubt, nothing would be going on without David,'' Mr. Sicha said. ''Writers who work on the Web are taught to flee whenever the guy from business side comes around. But we can build all the nice little audiences we want, somebody has to figure out how to explain to advertisers where the value is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era of digital media buildout, the 27-year-old Mr. Cho could be a very well-paid cog in a much larger apparatus, but he likes his odds at The Awl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the end of the summer, when we were looking at cash solvency, I felt pretty good about what we had done and the choices I had made,'' he said. ''I think that we can realistically expect to be in the low millions in terms of annual revenue in the next 18 months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Easy Street is hardly around the corner. Even now, there is a huge lag time between closing a deal and getting the money, which is hard on a site like The Awl, which has no cushion or backer. In 2010, the site had spent a month putting together a huge deal for a campaign for a network TV show, and when budgets got cut, The Awl was the first to go. No ad buyer at an agency or at a brand is going to get called on the carpet for not buying The Awl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the frontiers of digital media, it's a little like the fourth season of ''Mad Men.'' The company is still one or two big accounts from being in the money or back in the soup. Still, there is satisfaction in not lunging after traffic or spending your day devising the perfect search-optimized headline (one of the big traffic bumps for The Awl came from a story titled ''Seven Years as a Freelance Writer, or How to Make Vitamin Soup'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because there is no office -- staff members work out of their homes -- there is no office manager, no toner cartridge to replace, no lease to be negotiated, no pencils to steal. The company exists in a string of e-mails, instant messages and phone calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My friends keep talking to me about how they want to start a Web site, but they need to get some backing, and I look at them and ask them what they are waiting for,'' Mr. Sicha said. ''All it takes is some WordPress and a lot of typing. Sure, I went broke trying to start it, it trashed my life and I work all the time, but other than that, it wasn't that hard to figure out.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But strong gains in Northern Europe were partly offset by continued pessimism in Spain and other countries in the south that have been the focus of Europe's sovereign debt crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far, the expected growth dip in the euro area has not really materialized,'' Christoph Weil, an economist at <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> in Frankfurt said in a note. But he added, ''tensions are increasing below the surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the public European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, whose largest shareholder is the United States, raised its forecast for economic growth in the 29 so-called transition countries it covers, which extend from Hungary to Mongolia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recovery from the crisis is gradually becoming more broad-based across the region, although it is still fragile in some subregions,'' the bank said in a report. ''Even the recessions in the Baltic states and southeastern Europe appear to be finally bottoming out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in the region will reach 4.2 percent this year and 4.1 percent next year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said. In July, the bank, which also receives financing from Europe and countries including Japan and Australia, predicted growth of 3.5 percent this year and 3.9 percent next. Last year, output in the region shrank by 5.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countries that suffered double-digit plunges in economic output last year, including Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia and Ukraine, will grow again next year as bank lending resumes and unemployment falls, the bank said. It also raised its growth forecasts for countries like Poland, Romania and Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank left its forecast for Russia next year unchanged at 4.6 percent. It also said there remained big disparities among regions. In Southeastern Europe, which includes the former Yugoslavia as well as Albania, growth will reach only 1.6 percent next year. That is a more optimistic forecast than the bank made in July, but shows that the region is still struggling after output fell 0.6 percent this year and 5.4 percent in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central Asia, including countries like Kazakhstan, will grow the fastest because of higher prices for oil and other commodities, the bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the European Commission sentiment indicator was led by France and the Netherlands, with Germany recording only a modest increase -- another sign that the record growth there this year may be cooling. However, there was other good economic news from Germany on Thursday, as unemployment fell below the three million mark to 7 percent, an 18-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany is cashing in the dividend from changes to labor laws made several years ago, Axel A. Weber, president of the German Bundesbank, said. ''Comprehensive and sometimes painful labor market reforms have helped to make the labor market significantly more flexible,'' Mr. Weber told an audience in Eltville, Germany, according to a release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among business, the biggest improvement in the sentiment indicator was among manufacturers, because of booming exports. Financial services recorded a decline for the second month in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Weber and others cautioned that there were still many dangers, like excessive trade deficits or surpluses, that could derail growth. ''While the financial crisis has been associated with a narrowing of imbalances, recent data suggest that this development has started to go into reverse,'' Mr. Weber said. He called on China to allow its currency to fluctuate more to increase domestic demand and compensate for a soaring trade surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erik Berglof, chief economist of the bank, said that some of the problems that had caused a severe economic crisis in Eastern Europe last year, like a dependency on loans denominated in dollars, have eased. But much more work needs to be done, he said. ''There is no room for policy complacency,'' Mr. Berglof said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States economy is a bit like a jetliner short on fuel these days, waiting for something to give it the oomph needed for takeoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report offers not much by way of immediate relief, as the Commerce Department estimated on Friday that the nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter. That growth rate, matching the forecast, is the barest tick up from the second quarter.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak report comes at a parlous time for President Obama and the Democrats, who are only days away from crucial midterm elections that are widely expected to turn out well for Republican challengers. High unemployment and soaring foreclosure numbers in the Midwest and West already made this a particularly difficult election for Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's tens of millions of unemployed -- many now jobless for close to two years -- present a political and social challenge. Two percent growth, almost all economists agree, cannot produce nearly the demand needed to reduce the nation's 9.6 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade gap remained wide in the latest quarter, as imports again surged and outpaced exports, and that too could portend ill for job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the expected G.D.P. number, which is mostly bad news for the economy,'' Josh Bivens, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, said of the gross domestic product. ''The growth rate is just nowhere near enough to put downward pressure on unemployment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of last year, the picture was far brighter, when growth rose 5 percent as the country emerged from recession. But conditions have weakened considerably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is crucial to re-igniting the economy, and demand remained flaccid in the third quarter, although there were hints of increased consumer spending. Income growth, adjusted for inflation and taxes, slowed, rising at an annualized rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter after increasing at a 4.4 percent rate in the second. And at the other end, prices excluding food and energy increased at a rate of 0.6 percent compared with 0.8 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, the economy has presented two faces, which is reflected in the latest G.D.P. numbers. There have been fledgling signs of growth: home sales and chain store sales are up a bit; a swelling equities market has raised consumer confidence a few notches; and jobless claims fell noticeably last week, albeit they are still quite high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the steroidal effect of the federal stimulus spending is fading (although more than a trace of that spending is in the growth in large highway and bridge projects found in this quarter's output numbers). City and state governments have shed tens of thousands of employees, and states face a sea of red ink as they look at next year's budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two percent growth is not great, but it beats zero,'' said Steve Blitz, chief economist with ITG investment research. ''But the picture of the economy remains troubling. There is certainly no sign that a normal cyclical upturn is taking hold. The consumer is still underemployed and overindebted, so the normal push won't be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic bulls are more difficult to locate now than in the spring, when the economy appeared to gain traction. But Bernard Baumohl, chief economist for the Economic Outlook Group, has lost none of his elan, saying that he spots signs of strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main message from this report is that the economic recovery is gathering fresh momentum from the sector that matters most to this recovery: consumer spending,'' he said in an e-mail. ''Slowly but surely, worries over job security and future income growth have subsided and households appear to be more at ease about shopping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity, remains the great unknown. Americans have shed some debt, which is good, but in an unsightly fashion, which is not so good. They have defaulted on credit card debt or have lost their homes to foreclosure in record numbers. Their spending rose this quarter and personal savings was estimated at 5.5 percent of income, compared with 5.9 percent in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price and income growth remains too weak to banish entirely the fear that deflation might yet take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco touched on this prospect two weeks ago in a gloomy forecast, noting that no sector of the private economy stands ready to drive a robust recovery. ''The economic recovery is proceeding at a very slow pace and has lost momentum since the spring,'' said Mary C. Daly, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ''Japan's experience beginning in the early 1990s underscores the risk of getting into a long period of sustained disinflation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The midterm elections on Tuesday further complicate the economic picture. After the votes are counted, and certainty edges aside uncertainty, American business may start spending a bit more and banks may start lending to small businesses. But few economists are willing to turn that wish into a forecast, not the least because political deadlock looms as a possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rosenberg, economist for the Canadian investment firm Gluskin Sheff and Associates, does not put a lot of faith in consumers pulling the economy out of its ditch. ''Barring divine intervention, it's not clear how the economy keeps expanding in the coming year,'' he said. ''You'll have federal spending declining and more and more folks falling out of emergency unemployment benefits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eyes of some economists and political leaders have turned to overseas economies, in hopes that sturdier boats might come to America's aid. The Chinese economy has cooled a touch, but its engine remains impressive. And the European economies have shown signs of stabilizing of late, with Germany as a potential driver of growth (its unemployment recently reached an 18-year low). All of this could bode well for America's export sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the facts in Friday's report offered little immediate help. Imports in the third quarter once again grew faster than exports, leaving a significant trade gap. Imports grew at an annual rate of 17.4 percent, compared with a 5.0 percent gain for exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government spending began to slow, as the effects of the stimulus spending wear off. That was reflected in the unemployment numbers for September. Companies added 64,000 jobs last month, but over all, the economy lost 95,000 nonfarm jobs, the result of a 159,000 decline in government jobs. Local governments were particularly hard hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problematic factor is that consumers remain fundamentally insolvent or worried about becoming so, and too many of the major banks are zombies uninterested in commercial or industrial lending,'' said James K. Galbraith, an economics professor at the University of Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, each quarter that the economy does not lapse back into recession adds incrementally to consumer and business confidence, and perhaps eventually to growth. The great immediate test, economists say, is the fourth quarter. The hope is that small signs of market strength in recent weeks may coalesce into something that looks more like an actual recovery, and that by next spring unemployment may stabilize and the gloom may lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As with money, there is a power of compounding the economy,'' Mr. Blitz said. ''The longer you go with 2 percent growth, you begin to push up against constraints, and the more the fear of unemployment ebbs, the more chance there is that people will begin to feel confident. It's a very slow burn.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear whether the people who would actually be checking in share that excitement.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people using location-based services like Foursquare and Gowalla remains small, and does not appear to be growing, according to a report published Thursday by the Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On any given day, 1 percent of adult Americans use a service that allows them to share their location, according to the report. Four percent of adult Internet users use location-based services at all, down from 5 percent of Internet users who said they used such services in May. Only 6 percent of people who use social networking sites also used location-based services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People using location-based services fit the profile of any early adopter of new technologies, said Kathryn Zickuhr, the author of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men were twice as likely as women to use location-based services, and people between 18 and 29 years old were more than twice as likely to use them as any other adult age group. The Pew report did not include data on teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten percent of Hispanics reported using location-based services, compared with 5 percent of blacks and 3 percent of whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zickuhr said she was surprised at how companies building location into their business plans seemed to be far ahead of people using such services in their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report's findings may mostly serve as a baseline from which to measure the impact that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will have on location-based services. Pew interviewed 3,001 adults between Aug. 9 and Sept. 13. On Aug. 18, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> introduced Places, which incorporated aspects of Foursquare and Gowalla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is possible that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> will help bring location into the mainstream,'' said Ms. Zickuhr, referring to Places. ''It would not be surprising to see if that helps people get used to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> released a series of new features related to its mobile efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pew report notes how quickly technologies like these can go from obscurity to mainstream use. In August 2008, for example, 6 percent of adults used status-updating services like Twitter. By September 2010 that proportion had quadrupled.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marino &amp; Sons Fish Market opened on 30th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, in 1932, fulfilling the dreams of a scrawny teenager from Sicily who had been peddling fish from woven baskets along the streets of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fishmonger, Baldasarre Marino, and then a son, a grandson and a great-grandson -- all named Charles -- kept the market alive through the Great Depression, the 1970s fiscal crisis and the blackout of 2006. But the great recession proved to be too much, and the market closed in July, suffering the fate of some neighboring small businesses, like a pub run by a man from Ireland and a carpet store owned by a man from Greece.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no insurance against a bad economy,'' said Charlie Marino, a great-grandson of the fish market's founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But along with endings there have been beginnings. Last month, an eyewear shop opened in a spot where rolls of carpets were once stacked. Three doors from the fish market, a Louisiana-style restaurant is set to open soon, while across the street, a shuttered lounge has resurfaced as a Latin restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so this small commercial stretch -- eight blocks of 30th Avenue, bracketed by 31st Street and Steinway Street -- is a microcosm of how small businesses are faring as the economy flails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A street that has long been an incubator of financial hopes and aspirations for waves of immigrants has fallen victim to high rents and disappearing customers. But this strip also has a resilient streak, a history of newcomers arriving with an entrepreneurial spirit and a willingness to work hard and take a chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street may be the economic lifeblood of New York City, but it is small businesses, places with 100 workers or less, that are the city's backbone, accounting for 98 percent of its roughly 233,000 companies, according to the state's Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at the height of the recession in 2008, small businesses provided nearly half of all private-sector jobs available in the city, more than they did in 1990, a study to be released by the Center for an Urban Future, a research institute, found. ''Small businesses are the only ones that have been taking chances,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the center's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the struggles of neighborhood businesses are underscored by persistently high retail vacancy rates. Nowhere is the problem more pronounced than in Queens, which logged a vacancy rate of 13 percent in the third quarter of this year, the highest in the city, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap, a national brokerage firm. Manhattan had the lowest vacancy rate, about 7 percent. In the third quarter two years ago, the vacancy rates were 4 percent for Queens and 2.8 percent for Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey this summer by Representative Anthony D. Weiner painted a dismal picture in several shopping districts in Queens, finding more than one in 5 stores closed along a busy stretch of Jamaica Avenue that runs through Richmond Hill and Woodhaven, and one in 10 stores closed in Glendale. On Woodhaven Boulevard in Rego Park, almost 20 percent of storefronts were closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is more than an economic indicator,'' Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, said in an interview. ''It's a sort of psychic barometer of a community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Astoria, about 30 mom-and-pop stores along 30th Avenue have gone out of business in the past two years, in what has been of the most unforgiving financial times for a strip that has experienced booms and busts along with successive waves of immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greeks and Italians arrived at the turn of the last century and opened butcher shops and salumerias that sold prosciutto, pancetta and racks of lamb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Croatians followed, and then Czechs and other Eastern Europeans, who favored travel agencies and hair salons. More recently, Brazilians opened restaurants, and Arabs started jewelry stores. Now, in a reckless gamble or an act of faith, a fresh crop of business owners is trying to make it on the avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Annie Zhu, 31, and Michelle Ho, 35, friends and partners in the optical shop, Vision Essential, failure would probably mean having to go back to working for someone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Al Lau, 39, and his wife, Michele Addeo, 38, the owners of the Louisiana-style restaurant, Sugarfreak, it would probably mean losing everything they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lau and Ms. Addeo signed the lease on the 1,000-square-foot space a year ago and have been paying rent ever since, though their landlord agreed to charge them $3,000 a month, half of what they will be paying once the restaurant opens. The discount is welcome, but it does little to lessen their problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple applied for small-business loans, but banks turned them down, saying that restaurants were too risky, Mr. Lau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have run through their savings -- Mr. Lau is a lawyer and Ms. Addeo is a physical therapist -- and hit the limit on their credit cards to finance their restaurant, which is not yet finished. They spent $150,000 on kitchen equipment and $25,000 on lawyers after a neighborhood group opposed their application for a liquor license. (The restaurant has been granted a provisional license.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The store's wood floor was rotten, and it took two months to get the necessary permit to replace it, then an additional five months and $20,000 to replace a pipe connecting a water main to the restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are now waiting for a final inspection while applying the finishing touches. On a recent morning, their contractor arrived with a big chandelier that will hang over the bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point, we're too far into it to turn back,'' Mr. Lau said. ''But we're going to give it a shot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And it's going to work out,'' Ms. Addeo added. ''Hopefully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To open their eyewear shop on 30th Avenue, Ms. Zhu and Ms. Ho relied on a loan and a little luck. Because of the poor economy, Prada and Versace, which would ordinarily not do business with a small neighborhood store in Queens, were eager to sell to them. And though the two women quit their jobs to devote themselves full time to their business, their husbands did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody needs eyeglasses,'' said Ms. Ho, who was born in China, grew up in Hong Kong and moved to New York in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhu, whose parents came from China, added, ''The big question for us is, are people going to buy a $100 frame or a $300 frame?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their landlord, George Georgiou, 70, who ran the carpet store for 30 years, had many good years. He bought the building that housed his store -- ground-floor space with apartments above -- and a similar one nearby.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- In Silicon Valley, the three words on the tips of everyone's tongues are mobile, social and local.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add a fourth word and venture capitalists get excited: photos.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of new start-ups is focused on mobile photo-sharing, some of which plan to make money from local advertising. The smartphone apps transform cellphone photos so they look better, tag them with location data and post them in real time to social networks on phones and the Web.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apps, like Instagram, Hipstamatic, DailyBooth and PicPlz, are generally free or cost a small amount. So far, they have been small-time projects for the people who built them. But now a few are trying to transform themselves into real businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mixed Media Labs, the company that makes PicPlz, will announce on Thursday that it has raised $5 million from Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent venture capital firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is annoying to take photos with your cellphone and have them look good and get them off your phone,'' said Dalton Caldwell, co-founder and chief executive of Mixed Media who previously co-founded Imeem, the now-closed music site. ''That solves a real need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PicPlz offers an Android and iPhone app and a Web site. People take photos with their phones and can apply eight different filters to change their look, such as ''the '70s'' or ''Russian toy camera.'' They can upload them to PicPlz, where others can view photo streams from a particular user or location, so it is like a visual version of Twitter. They can also send them to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter or Foursquare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PicPlz is one of the newest wave of consumer tech products being built first as mobile apps, with the Web site as second priority -- an idea that would have seemed foreign just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think for the next generation of companies, the application they deliver on the mobile side is way more important than the Web site,'' Mr. Caldwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and some of the other photo app developers talk about still-vague goals of expanding the apps into mobile networks, based on location or groups of friends. Mixed Media plans to build many location-based apps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Caldwell says he still doesn't know exactly what the company will do, he knows what it will not do -- repeat the mistakes he made at Imeem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sold Imeem's assets to MySpace last year at a loss. He blames its failure on the impossibility of negotiating with music companies for digital music, but also said he made every mistake in the book while running it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he said he waited too long to figure out how to make money at Imeem. He plans to make revenue his first priority at PicPlz, possibly with location-based advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is also trying to avoid peaks and plunges in PicPlz's growth. The app has been downloaded 130,000 times since the Android app was introduced in May and the iPhone app in August. Instagram, a competitor, was introduced last month and already has more than 300,000 users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Andreessen Horowitz chose PicPlz over the company that makes Instagram, called Burbn. Earlier, the firm invested small amounts of money in each, before Burbn scrapped its original mobile check-in service to focus on the photo-sharing app. But since venture capitalists avoid investing in competing companies, Andreessen Horowitz can't invest in both as they are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the investment, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz and of Netscape, will join Mixed Media's board, a rarity since the other boards he serves on are much bigger companies: <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> and Skype.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even beyond the other photo-sharing apps, there are many other competitors. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter are already hugely popular on cellphones, as are mobile services like Foursquare. And other apps, like TwitPic and Yfrog, let people upload photos from their phones to Twitter and other sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very hard to get people to pay attention when there's so much noise,'' said Greg Sterling, an analyst who studies the mobile Internet. ''I think, by and large, they're not going to be very successful, but there will be one or two that break out.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leogane, Haiti</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VENANTE LINO, a small-business owner who lost nearly everything in the devastating earthquake in January, stood in line here along with dozens of other impeccably dressed women, all waiting to pay the latest monthly installment on the emergency loans they received to rebuild their businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Lino approached a folding table in the courtyard of one of the few remaining buildings in this town, located near the quake's epicenter. She emptied her pockets of cash and gave all $40 to the loan officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every day, I wake up and ask God to make this better. Many days, I don't think he's listening,'' says Mrs. Lino, a 63-year-old grandmother who lives under a tarp in her backyard with three grown children and four grandchildren, surviving on the meager income from a small food and cooking-oil business she reopened this summer with loan money. ''Without this help, I don't know where my family would be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in this once-bustling coastal town about 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince, more than 30,000 people -- a third of the population -- died as a result of the quake. Throughout Haiti, the toll may be as high as 250,000, and the economic effects have been staggering. The country's economy is expected to contract by as much as 9 percent this year, and more than a million residents live in tent cities. And an outbreak of cholera, as well as a hurricane early this month, have left the nation even more vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially hard hit are the tens of thousands of small-business owners, known as ti machann, who sell everything from heating oil to school uniforms from their homes and are often the sole breadwinners for their families. Because Haiti's credit markets remain frozen, people like Mrs. Lino would have had almost no chance to rebuild if it weren't for microbanks like Fonkoze, Haiti's largest, which gave loans to the women in Leogane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the best circumstances, sustaining a ''bank to the poor'' is no easy feat, but in Haiti after the earthquake, the challenge has been extraordinary. Even before the quake, 80 percent of the population lived on less than $2 a day. Today, while some 50 nations and organizations have pledged a total of $8.75 billion for reconstruction, less than 15 percent of the total promised for 2010-11 has arrived. (The United States has not yet paid all the $1.2 billion in reconstruction funds it pledged.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haitian microbanks provide a crucial lifeline to the poor, but their financial situations are sometimes nearly as precarious as those of their clients. Moreover, the banks are operating in a country that lacks many of the basic building blocks for businesses -- reliable transportation, communication and supply networks -- thus making the challenges all the more complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their importance to hundreds of thousands of Haitian borrowers and savers gives these little institutions an outsize importance, making them ''simply too big to fail,'' said Greta Greathouse, a consultant with the United States Agency for International Development's microsavings and lending program in Haiti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are dealing with a very vulnerable and fragile population,'' she said. The banks ''need to get stronger on a permanent basis so they can offset the operational risks that come with Haiti because of the earthquake and the inherent risks that are unfortunately a way of life for the country and its people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICROCREDIT banks, or microbanks, were pioneered by Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span>, which started 40 years ago by giving loans of a few dollars each to poor entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. In 2006, Mr. Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize for this work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most cases today, microcredit clients start off with loans of as little as $25 to start a small business. The loans are often given to women who tend to spend their earnings directly on their families and communities. Many borrow in groups of five or more, and all members of the group work together and are responsible for repayment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some microlenders provide only loans, while others also offer education and health services. Partly because costs are so high, effective interest rates are often significantly steeper than those at traditional banks. In Haiti, rates range from 30 percent to 55 percent a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Haiti is one of the most complicated environments for anyone to do business, let alone a small lender with an extremely poor clientele,'' said Alex Counts, president of the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit in Washington that fosters microlending. ''Appropriate levels of interest are important, but it's also essential these organizations continue to do the important work they do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the largest of Haiti's microcredit groups, Finca Haiti, wrote off almost a third of its portfolio after many clients died in the earthquake or lost their homes and businesses. A staggering 53 percent of its borrowers were late on their payments. After losses of its own, ACME, another Haitian microbank, raised additional capital this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fonkoze, Creole for ''shoulder to shoulder,'' was started by the Rev. Joseph Philippe, a Haitian priest, in the mid-1990s. It has 45,000 clients and 43 branches across the country, but it lost $2 million in the three years before the earthquake. In 2008, after losses from a particularly bad hurricane season, the organization considered closing its for-profit bank and incorporating that division's 24 branches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the share of microcredit clients in Haiti who have defaulted or are at risk of doing so has risen to 18 percent, more than double the rate of a year ago. The international standard is 2 to 3 percent. Several of the Haitian microbanks, particularly some very small ones, could close or reduce their operations if their portfolios don't improve, according to microbanking experts in Haiti and elsewhere. It's likely that some will have to consolidate in order to survive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microbanks in other countries are increasingly aiming to become self-sustaining so they don't need to continually raise funds to pay operational expenses. Some have transformed themselves from nonprofit into for-profit banks, raising questions of whether altruism and capitalism can co-exist. India's largest microlender, <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, went public this summer, raising $358 million, and other banks may do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most microbanks in Haiti remain nonprofits, and have less financial transparency, Fonkoze started a for-profit bank (in addition to its nonprofit arm) in 2004 and reports both divisions' earnings. It operated at a loss for three years but has stabilized after $15 million in donations this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haiti has had natural disasters before, of course. But the earthquake's impact on the nation's banks was staggeringly high, in no small part because of the damage in Port-au-Prince, the capital, which accounts for 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The banking sector, already fragile, was crippled. Out of 1,800 microbank employees in the affected region, 600 lost their homes. A quarter of the $38 million in outstanding microcredit loans in the region could end up defaulting, according to an analysis by Ms. Greathouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the risks and financial costs, several Haitian microbanks are expanding, saying their loans are one of the only paths to self-sufficiency for the growing number of poor people in Port-au-Prince and the countryside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, after losing a third of its 12,000 clients after the earthquake, Finca added back 1,000 clients this summer with the help of a grant from the Citibank Foundation. It's a risky move: the percentage of Finca Haiti clients who are more than 30 days behind on their payments, a standard known as portfolio at risk, remains at 35 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, after its director was ambushed in an attempted robbery, the bank moved its headquarters from the capital to a nearby coastal city, Saint-Marc, according to Rupert Scofield, the president of Finca, which is based in Washington and operates in 21 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to doing business, ''Haiti is probably the hardest place in the world right now outside maybe Afghanistan,'' Mr. Scofield says. ''It always seems just as things get stabilized, something else happens to pull the country back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anne Hastings, Fonkoze's co-chief executive, has become something of an international aid celebrity: she was a high-profile attendee of the Clinton Global Initiative conference this fall in New York. (The bank's profile rose significantly in the days after the earthquake, when it was one of the only banks operating outside Port-au-Prince, and Ms. Hastings secured American military assistance to airlift $2 million in cash to desperate clients.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after the quake, Fonkoze wrote off 10,000 loans -- almost a quarter of its total number -- with funds from the Red Cross and others. The bank then gave each client a new loan and a one-time cash payment of $125, at a total cost of $8.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the bank has broadened its health program and aggressively stepped up its operations, particularly in rural areas where poverty rates are highest and seem to be growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank has enlarged a loan program, called Ti Kredi, or Little Credit, to reach poor families that are not ready for larger loans. Ti Kredi offers loans of just $25, shorter repayment periods, additional support from loan officers, and literacy and health classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another program, clients are offered goats or chickens so they can sell milk or eggs, as well as a weekly stipend of $7 to help with expenses, and to ensure that they don't need to kill the animals because they are hungry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE the summer, Fonkoze loan officers have canvassed the lush, mountainous region on motorcycles, in pickup trucks or on foot to sign up as many as 3,000 new clients and to meet with existing ones to monitor their progress and to collect loan payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent rainy day, Steve Werlin rode for more than an hour on the back of a pickup truck outside Mirebalais, a small, central plateau town two hours north of Port-au-Prince. Mr. Werlin, a regional Fonkoze director, was on his way to meet Marie Ange Joute, a 30-year-old mother of two. Ms. Joute joined Fonkoze in September and lives with her children, mother, sister and niece (who was sick with a severe eye infection) in a small mud house with a tin roof on a 20-by-20-foot parcel of land. The house, which Ms. Joute inherited from her father, is her only asset, and she said the family had sometimes gone without food and medical care over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has no business background but recently received two chickens and a goat from the bank and started selling eggs and heating oil from her house. To save enough money to expand her inventory, she joined a savings club with 10 local Fonkoze clients. Each woman saves a third of her weekly stipend so that once every 10 weeks, they get a lump-sum payment of $20 for larger purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients are required to do many things on their own, and face penalties if they cannot meet certain goals. On the day of the visit, Ms. Joute had yet to build a shed for her goat, which could become sick in the rain. So she was told she wouldn't get her stipend the next week unless the shed was built. (Fonkoze gave her materials and training to build the shed, and she complied.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to make my own money and care for my family,'' she said. ''I want to provide for us if something goes bad. I know how to work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER the upcoming presidential elections, Haiti's government is expected to issue new banking regulations, including rules for microlenders. They aren't regulated now, though they have appealed for years to the government for rules that could bring more certainty to the industry. If a microbank went out of business, for example, it is not clear what would happen to the many clients who deposit their savings in the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fonkoze has 200,000 savings accounts, totaling $14 million. Currently, it uses those funds to make new loans, and it says that all of its accounts are secure. Because it was able to write off risky loans early this year, according to James Kurz, a senior Fonkoze financial adviser, its portfolio at risk has fallen to 5 percent in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Haiti's economy doesn't improve and the country cannot stem various other problems, even some people who have managed to eke out a living with the help of microcredit could face more difficulty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sainte Anne Louis sells sodas, canned goods, clothing and homemade peanut butter outside her home in Mirebalais, yards away from a construction site for a new rural teaching hospital. She says her sales have fallen by nearly half this year, in part because it has been hard to secure enough inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Louis, 54, supports her entire family, including her husband, two daughters and their families. She worries about what will happen if things don't improve soon. ''We are grateful for what we have today,'' she says, ''but we pray tomorrow will be better.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody thought Roshaneh was nuts. And at first nothing went right. The poor refused to borrow. Or if they borrowed, they didn't repay their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Roshaneh persisted, and today Kashf has 152 branches around the country. It has dispersed more than $200 million to more than 300,000 families. Now Roshaneh is moving into microsavings, to help the poor build assets, as well as programs to train the poor to run businesses more efficiently. She is even thinking of expanding into schools for the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microfinance is sometimes oversold as a silver bullet -- which it's not. Careful follow-up studies suggest that gains from microloans are often quite modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some borrowers squander money or start businesses that fail. Some micro-lenders tarnish the field because they're incompetent, and others because they rake in profits with sky-high loan rates. Microfinance has also generally been less successful in Africa than in South Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet done right, microfinance can make a significant difference. An outside evaluation found that after four years, Kashf borrowers are more likely than many others to enjoy improved economic conditions -- and that's what I've seen over the years as I've visited Kashf borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this trip, I met a woman named Parveen Baji, who says she never attended a day of school and until recently was completely illiterate. She had 14 children, but five died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Parveen's husband, who also never attended school, regularly beat her and spent the family savings on narcotics, she says. The family's only possessions were four cots on which they slept, crammed three or four to a cot, in a rented apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One night all my children were hungry,'' she remembered. ''I sent my daughter to ask for food from a neighbor. And the neighbor said, 'you've become a beggar,' and refused.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Ms. Parveen got a $70 loan from Kashf and started a jewelry and cosmetics business, buying in bulk and selling to local shops. Ms. Parveen couldn't read the labels, but she memorized which bottle was which. As her business thrived, she began to struggle to learn reading and arithmetic -- and proved herself an ace student. I fired math problems at her, and she dazzled me with her quick responses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Parveen began to start new businesses, even building a laundry that she put her husband in charge of to keep him busy. He no longer beats her, she says, and when I interviewed him separately he seemed a little awed by her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, Ms. Parveen started a restaurant and catering business that now has eight employees, including some of her daughters. She bought a home and has put some of her children through high school -- and a son, the brightest student, through college. She has just paid $5,800 for a permit for him to move to London to take a health sector job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Parveen tried to look modest as she told me this, but she failed. She was beaming and shaking her head in wonder as she watched her son speak English with me, dazzled at the thought that she was dispatching her university-educated son to Europe. ''Microfinance has changed my life,'' she said simply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's an unusual success story. But the larger message is universal: helping people start businesses, create jobs and support education is a potent way to undermine extremism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We Americans overinvest in firepower to defeat extremism and underinvest in development, and so we could learn something useful from Roshaneh. The toolkit to fight terrorism includes not only missiles but also microfinance and economic opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The antonym of ''militant'' is often ''job.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MADOOR, India -- India's rapidly growing private microcredit industry faces imminent collapse as almost all borrowers in one of India's largest states have stopped repaying their loans, egged on by politicians who accuse the industry of earning outsize profits on the backs of the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis has been building for weeks, but has now reached a critical stage. Indian banks, which put up about 80 percent of the money that the companies lent to poor consumers, are increasingly worried that after surviving the global financial crisis mostly unscathed, they could now face serious losses. Indian banks have about $4 billion tied up in the industry, banking officials say.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are extremely worried about our exposure to the microfinance sector,'' said Sunand K. Mitra, a senior executive at <span class="companylink">Axis Bank</span>, speaking Tuesday on a panel at the India Economic Summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's crisis is likely to reverberate around the globe. Initially the work of nonprofit groups, the tiny loans to the poor known as microcredit once seemed a promising path out of poverty for millions. In recent years, foundations, venture capitalists and the World Bank have used India as a petri dish for similar for-profit ''social enterprises'' that seek to make money while filling a social need. Like-minded industries have sprung up in Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But microfinance in pursuit of profits has led some microcredit companies around the world to extend loans to poor villagers at exorbitant interest rates and without enough regard for their ability to repay. Some companies have more than doubled their revenues annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some Indian officials fear that microfinance could become India's version of the United States' subprime mortgage debacle, in which the seemingly noble idea of extending home ownership to low-income households threatened to collapse the global banking system because of a reckless, grow-at-any-cost strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to public anger over abuses in the microcredit industry -- and growing reports of suicides among people unable to pay mounting debts -- legislators in the state of Andhra Pradesh last month passed a stringent new law restricting how the companies can lend and collect money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the new legislation was being passed, local leaders urged people to renege on their loans, and repayments on nearly $2 billion in loans in the state have virtually ceased. Lenders say that less than 10 percent of borrowers have made payments in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, the industry faces collapse in a state where more than a third of its borrowers live. Lenders are also having trouble making new loans in other states, because banks have slowed lending to them as fears about defaults have grown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government officials in the state say they had little choice but to act, and point to women like Durgamma Dappu, a widowed laborer from this impoverished village who took a loan from a private microfinance company because she wanted to build a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had never had a bank account or earned a regular salary but was given a $200 loan anyway, which she struggled to repay. So she took another from a different company, then another, until she was nearly $2,000 in debt. In September she fled her village, leaving her family little choice but to forfeit her tiny plot of land, and her dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These institutions are using quite coercive methods to collect,'' said V. Vasant Kumar, the state's minister for rural development. ''They aren't looking at sustainability or ensuring the money is going to income-generating activities. They are just making money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reddy Subrahmanyam, a senior official who helped write the Andhra Pradesh legislation, accuses microfinance companies of making ''hyperprofits off the poor,'' and said the industry had become no better than the widely despised village loan sharks it was intended to replace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The money lender lives in the community,'' he said. ''At least you can burn down his house. With these companies, it is loot and scoot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, some of the anger appears to have been fueled by the recent initial public offering of shares by <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, India's largest for-profit microlender, backed by famous investors like George Soros and Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SKS and its shareholders raised more than $350 million on the stock market in August. Its revenue and profits have grown around 100 percent annually in recent years. This year, Vikram Akula, chairman of <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, privately sold shares worth about $13 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He defended the industry's record before the India Economic Summit meeting, saying that a few rogue operators may have given improper loans, but that the industry was too important to fail. ''Microfinance has made a tremendous contribution to inclusive growth,'' he said. Destroying microfinance, he said, would result in ''nothing less than financial apartheid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian microfinance companies have some of the world's lowest interest rates for small loans. Mr. Akula said that his company had reduced its interest rate by six percentage points, to 24 percent, in the past several years as volume had brought down expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other officials in his industry, Vijay Mahajan, the chairman of Basix, an organization that provides loans and other services to the poor, acknowledged that many lenders grew too fast and lent too aggressively. Investments by private equity firms and the prospect of a stock market listing drove firms to increase lending as fast as they could, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In their quest to grow,'' he said, ''they kept piling on more loans in the same geographies.'' He added, ''That led to more indebtedness, and in some cases it led to suicides.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, the number of borrowers who are struggling to pay off their debts is much smaller than officials have asserted. He estimates that 20 percent have borrowed more than they can afford and that just 1 percent are in serious trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of India's leading social workers, Ela Bhatt, who heads the Self-Employed Women's Association, or SEWA, said microfinance firms had lost sight of the fact that the poor needed more than loans to be successful entrepreneurs. They need business and financial advice as well, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were more concerned about growth -- not growth of the livelihoods and economic status of the clients, but only the institutions' growth,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahajan, who is also the chairman of the Microfinance Institutions Network, said that the industry was now planning to create a fund to help restructure the loans of the 20 percent of borrowers in Andhra Pradesh who were struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said the industry, which has been reluctant to accept outside help, would share its client databases with the government and was negotiating restrictions on retail lending that did not go through the nonprofit self-help lending groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of the industry could have severe consequences for borrowers, who may be forced to resort to money lenders once again. It is tough to find a household in this village in an impoverished district of Andhra Pradesh that is not deeply in debt to a for-profit microfinance company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">K. Shivamma, a 38-year-old farmer, said she took her first loan hoping to reverse several years of crop failure brought on by drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you take the loan they say, 'Don't worry, it is easy to pay back,' '' Ms. Shivamma said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The man from Share, the company that made her first loan, did not ask about her income, Ms. Shivamma said. She soon ran into trouble paying back the $400 loan, and took out another loan, and then another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now she owes nearly $2,000 and has no idea how she will repay it. The television, the mobile phone and the two buffaloes she bought with one loan were sold long ago. ''I know it is a vicious circle,'' she said. ''But there is no choice but to go on.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Parker, the entrepreneur behind Napster and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> now turned investor, was talking about the state of the venture capital industry last week over coffee. At 30, Mr. Parker, who was recently portrayed by Justin Timberlake in ''The Social Network,'' has been thinking a lot about innovation - or the lack of it - in the United States. And he's come to a depressing conclusion about the money industry that he says used to be ''the engine of innovation'' for this country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The risk-reward doesn't work out in favor of putting money into venture capital anymore,'' he said, even though he himself is a partner in a venture capital firm that owns stakes in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, the private spaceflight company run by Elon Musk, a co-founder of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>. Mr. Parker, a night owl who had awakened before his usual rising time of noon to meet with me, the problem plaguing the venture business represented a ''systemic risk'' to the country that he believed meant ''innovation could gradually grind to a halt or at least become less effective.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker may tend toward hyperbole, but ever since the bursting of the dot-com bubble, there has been a steady drumbeat of ''venture capital is dead.'' In the last year, however, that drumbeat has gotten louder as it has become clear that many of the best-known venture firms in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have returned a pittance to their investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Cambridge Associates</span> U.S. Venture Capital Index, venture capital retuned a paltry 8.4 percent return to investors over the last decade, starting in 1999. <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span> reported last month that venture capital investing had fallen off a cliff this year, down 47 percent in the first half of the year compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'll see big old established firms that everybody thought were here to stay probably splintering,'' said Mr. Parker. That's in part because he is convinced that the industry's biggest backers - institutional investors - are going to seek a haven elsewhere. ''I can't name names but certain large university endowments have lost as much as half of their value,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For every <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, there are dozens of start-ups that never make it. That's the model - it is all about swinging for the fences. Even <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, still private, having not pursued an initial public offering, has yet to see the big payoff for its largest investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the problems often cited for the depressing venture capital world is the perception of a tight market for I.P.O.'s. Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark Capital, which was an early investor in <span class="companylink">eBay</span> and OpenTable.com, says he believes exaggerated expectations are the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We may also have a perturbed notion of what a healthy I.P.O. market looks like,'' he wrote last week on his blog. ''The I.P.O. market of 1999 was a myth, a facade, a once-in-a-lifetime mirage that you will never see again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the I.P.O. market is dead may also be a myth, however. It may just be Silicon Valley. Only 11 of the 42 high-tech, venture-backed I.P.O.'s since 2008 came from Silicon Valley. As Mr. Gurley pointed out, ''In other words, 74 percent of these I.P.O.'s hail from outside of the S.V. echo chamber.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley's latest, greatest hope - clean tech and green tech - also seems to be failing despite big investments from the likes of John Doerr of <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span> and Vinod Khosla, a former Kleiner partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not clear anyone will make money on their green-tech investing. It looks like it was a bubble, '' Mr. Parker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But worst of all, from the standpoint of innovation, entrepreneurs may be changing the way they are thinking - they are becoming less ambitious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ten years ago, venture capitalists would ask the question: Do you want to build a company and flip it or do you want to build a company and I.P.O. it? It's a trick question. The correct answer was always 'I want to build an incredibly valuable stand-alone business and maybe we get bought, maybe we go public but we're going to build an incredibly valuable company,' '' Mr. Parker said. ''Now it's actually not clear that that's the right answer. There's a lot of venture firms that are clearly interested in building something and selling it either to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say Mr. Parker is all doom and gloom. His firm may actually have another venture capital-backed winner on its hands in Spotify, an online music service that some analysts suggest could one day challenge Apple's iTunes. But before you get too excited about great leaps in innovation in the United States, consider this: Mr. Parker didn't discover Spotify in his backyard. It was founded in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given his own status as a rock star entrepreneur, just how did Mr. Parker feel about Justin Timberlake's portrayal of him in the ''The Social Network?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pausing for a moment, Mr. Parker reflected: ''It's hard to complain about being played by a sex symbol.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But we doubt that the resilience of exports will last, even if the euro weakens further,'' she said. ''German exports (and business sentiment) have responded strongly to changes in world demand in the past and our global forecasts point to a very sharp slowdown to come. German exporters cannot rely on Asian demand alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Wednesday from Eurostat, the official statistics agency of the European Union, suggested caution was in order.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders for industrial goods for the 16 member nations included in the euro zone fell 3.8 percent in September from August; for all 27 members of the European Union, new orders fell 2.5 percent in September from August. Still, new orders were up by 13.5 percent from a year earlier in the euro zone and by 13.4 percent in the entire union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McKeown said fiscal tightening would constrain any consumer revival, and business and consumer sentiment could suffer as the euro zone bailed out weaker members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Ifo survey suggests Germany will keep driving the euro zone recovery ''in the very near term at least,'' she said, adding: ''We expect the region's largest economy to expand by about 3.5 percent this year before growth slows to about 1.5 percent in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In London, a report from the Office for National Statistics showed that the British economy expanded by 0.8 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, confirming the initial estimate from October. Gross domestic product grew 2.8 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Corfe, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London, wrote in a note that the figures were in line with market expectations, but said the details revealed ''underlying weaknesses in the U.K. economy, which we believe will bear down on growth over the quarters ahead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, he noted, consumption, investment and government expenditure all slowed in the quarter, pointing to ''frailty in the domestic demand side of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is certainly scope for private demand to disappoint,'' Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays Capital Research, wrote in an analysis. ''However, the recent momentum in private demand provides plenty of headroom for a continued expansion even if these risks crystallize.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2004, during Justin Bajema's second tour of duty in Iraq, his LAV-25 infantry fighting vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device. Surrounded by heavy machine-gun fire, he was pinned under 28,000 pounds in a drained canal for 40 minutes. ''It threw my vehicle in the air like a toy,'' he recalled. ''I almost lost my leg, almost bled out and died.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He endured eight operations and spent six weeks in the hospital, but doctors were able to save his left leg. He learned to walk again on a limb with no sensory nerves. ''That experience made me question everything,'' said Mr. Bajema, a Marine corporal. ''I later dropped out of business school because they were teaching me to get a job, but I knew I was here to do more than the daily grind. So I made the decision to start this business.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Bajema returned to Grand Rapids, Mich., his hometown, and began buying and renovating foreclosed properties with money he had saved while in the service. He was trying to regain the confidence he lost when he was injured in war. ''I was sick of taking orders,'' he said. ''I was looking for a bigger purpose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While combat veterans face countless challenges in their transitions back to civilian life, Mr. Bajema and many of his peers credit the military with giving them the courage, discipline and determination to start businesses. They believe even harrowing experiences, if managed and overcome, can lend perspective and fearlessness in commerce and provoke that ''healthy discontent with the status quo'' that galvanizes entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Marine Corps instilled a lot of things I've applied to the business world,'' said Mark Llano, who fought in Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf and who, in 2003, founded Source One Distributors, a company based in Wellington, Fla., that simplifies the procurement of tactical equipment by government and law enforcement agencies. ''When I saw an opportunity for this business, I hustled every day, working 80 hours a week. Because of my experience in the Marines, the hard work didn't scare me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Llano, many veterans who become entrepreneurs cultivate as clients government agencies that give preference to businesses owned by veterans, especially if they are disabled. ''If you have served in the military and you understand the government, you have knowledge other people don't,'' Mr. Llano said. ''If you can apply that niche to business, it's a home run.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veterans have other advantages as well. ''If two people walk in the door with the same idea for a lemonade stand, the veteran will get more assistance than the civilian,'' said James Mingey, a Vietnam veteran and entrepreneur who is president and chief executive of the Veterans Corporation, a nonprofit that fosters business opportunities for veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mingey and others in the field said they did not know of anyone keeping definitive statistics on rates of entrepreneurship for veterans, but that they believed the percentage remained small. Those veterans who do start businesses can benefit from many nonprofits and mentoring organizations and vast networks of veterans willing to help, but they also face challenges that veterans of earlier wars did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''World War II veterans were a large part of the work force,'' said Kevin McDermott, who in 2007 helped found Patriot Taxiway Industries, an airfield and aircraft lighting provider based in Lomira, Wis., with a fellow Air Force veteran. ''The 1950s workplace they created was a reflection of military culture.'' Recent veterans, however, struggle to reconcile the disparate cultures of the military, which is regimented and hierarchical, and the entrepreneurial realm, which values critical thinking and innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the military you're told what you're going to do from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''Veterans need to adjust. We give goals or objectives and they need to learn to set their own schedules.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While military training provides relevant lessons in loyalty and leadership, moving to the private sector can be agonizing. ''When you get out of the military, it's like being hit in the face by a brick wall,'' Mr. Bajema said. ''You don't even know where to start.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veterans often lack business education and the ability to translate their skills into desirable qualifications for an employer or client. ''A veteran thinks if he cleaned guns in the military, he'll probably have to do that when he gets out,'' said John Raftery, who was a member of the First Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and who founded Patriot Contractors, based in Red Oak, Tex. ''But if you can identify the skills you learned -- like keeping an inventory -- you can apply that to something like a retail career.'' To facilitate the shift, Mr. Raftery and Mr. Bajema attended the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities, a program at Syracuse University that teaches skills like defining a value proposition and taking a product to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communication can be a hurdle. Most civilian employees expect greater diplomacy and tact than is normally afforded military personnel. Mr. Bajema said a substandard employee once cried during a performance review, and later quit. ''It was an eye-opener for me,'' he said. ''In the military there's no sensitivity. I've toned it down and tried to improve myself by asking people I respect how to deliver feedback.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some veterans continue to suffer psychological torment long after physical injuries have healed. Of an employee with post-traumatic stress disorder, Mr. McDermott said, ''Some days he's our greatest employee, and other days we have to give him a ride home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had over one million people rotate through Iraq -- a million people who've seen their buddies killed and have taken lives,'' Mr. Bajema said. ''We were a heavy combat unit. Three-quarters of my platoon got purple hearts. Those are deep scars. Even if you're not wounded by shrapnel, you're wounded on the inside.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Bajema maintains that veterans are disproportionately suited to the sweat and toil of entrepreneurship. His company, Access Property Management, rents residential units Mr. Bajema owns and also leases and manages buildings for others. With eight employees overseeing assets worth nearly $10 million, Mr. Bajema said the company is profitable on revenue of a little more than $1 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw an incredible opportunity in real estate here,'' he said. ''We bought foreclosures at a deep discount.'' While his hometown has a high unemployment rate, he is betting that a blossoming health science industry will attract people to Grand Rapids and that they will choose to rent, rather than buy, their homes. ''People are scared to buy,'' he said. ''We're seeing increased demand for our properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as he tries to expand Access into a regional company, Mr. Bajema is relying once again on his military training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At first it was just me, the lone man in the trenches fighting for survival,'' he said. ''I was trying to do everything myself instead of delegating authority, and I was cheap when I should have spent money to grow my business. I've had to change on the fly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the increased volume of inquiries persuaded him to hire additional sales representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the same in the military,'' he said. ''You never have the complete picture, but you need to make a decision. You act or you get killed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he recognizes additional hiring requires a risky outlay of cash, Mr. Bajema is searching for a senior manager or ''lieutenant'' to help spearhead growth.</p>

When he said it was not about the money, they told him he could have a promotion, work in a different area or even start his own company inside <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He turned down all the inducements and joined <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s newest rival.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Google</span>'s gotten to be a lot bigger and slower-moving of a company,'' said the former manager, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect business relationships. ''At <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, I could see how quickly I could get things done compared to <span class="companylink">Google</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>, which only 12 years ago was a scrappy start-up in a garage, now finds itself viewed in Silicon Valley as the big, lumbering incumbent. Inside the company some of its best engineers are chafing under the growing bureaucracy and are leaving to start or work at smaller, nimbler companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent departures include low-level engineers, product managers and prominent managers like Lars Rasmussen, who helped create <span class="companylink">Google</span> Maps and Wave before he left for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and Omar Hamoui, the founder of AdMob who was vice president for mobile ads at <span class="companylink">Google</span> and is now looking for his next project. At least 142 of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s employees came from <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate sclerosis is a problem for all companies as they grow. But a hardening of the bureaucracy and a slower pace of work is even more perceptible in Silicon Valley, where companies grow at Internet speed and pride themselves on constant innovation -- and where the most talented people are often those with the most entrepreneurial drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Silicon Valley's innovation comes about as engineers leave companies to start their own. For <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which in five years has grown to 23,000 employees from 5,000 and to $23.7 billion in revenue from $3.2 billion, the risk is that it will miss the best people and the next great idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a short step from scale to sclerosis,'' said Daniel H. Pink, an author and analyst on the workplace. ''It becomes a more acute problem in Silicon Valley, where in a couple years, you could have some competitor in a garage ready to put you out entirely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>'s chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, says that people who think <span class="companylink">Google</span> faces brain drain are ''fundamentally wrong.'' The company's attrition rate for people it wished would stay has been constant for seven years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s maturation worries him. ''There was a time when three people at <span class="companylink">Google</span> could build a world-class product and deliver it, and it is gone,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''So I think it's absolutely harder to get things out the door. That's probably our biggest strategic issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, <span class="companylink">Google</span> is taking aggressive steps to retain employees, particularly those with start-up ambitions. <span class="companylink">Google</span> has given several engineers who said they were leaving to start new companies the chance to start them within <span class="companylink">Google</span>. They work independently and can recruit other engineers and use <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s resources, like its code base and servers, according to half a dozen employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> Wave, a way for people to work together online, was one example. The engineering team, based in Sydney, Australia, worked independently and got equity in the project, according to three people briefed on the agreement. But <span class="companylink">Google</span> shut down Wave this year, and Mr. Rasmussen, who led the project, quit for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> soon after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> is considering opening a start-up incubator inside the company, according to two people briefed on the plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big companies have made similar attempts with varying success. Cisco Systems's program has given birth to new businesses like TelePresence, a videoconferencing service, but <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>'s incubator was shut down in 2008, a year and a half after it started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the beginning, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have tried to prevent atrophy. That is one reason <span class="companylink">Google</span> gives everyone time -- called 20 percent time at the company -- to work on their own projects. The company tries to limit groups of engineers working on projects to 10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in reality, engineering groups quickly swell to 20 or even 40, several <span class="companylink">Google</span> product managers said. And new products created during 20 percent time are less likely to get anywhere these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular <span class="companylink">Google</span> products like Gmail grew out of 20 percent time, for instance. But engineers say they have been encouraged to build fewer new products and focus on building improvements to existing ones, like the terrain layer on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Maps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of these cool features that are very hidden, and a lot of people worked very hard on them and they were kind of sad that they spent a year of their life on something that gets 0.1 percent usage,'' said another product manager who is considering leaving for a start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s problem is that the best engineers are often the ones with the most entrepreneurial thirst. <span class="companylink">Google</span> loaded up on that type in its early hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those go-getters now want to leave as they become frustrated with the processes and procedures. Josh McFarland, a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> product manager who left last year and started TellApart, which helps retailers advertise online, said he knew it was time to leave as the number of people he had to copy on e-mail messages ballooned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that there is a class of person who is able to walk away from this relatively easy, consistent money because they are so dissatisfied with the processes of a big company,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For others, it is about making more money elsewhere. Start-ups have a riskier and potentially more rewarding lure: shares in a company before an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>, which has always been generous with salary, stock options and benefits like massages, dry cleaning and free food, is going a step further to keep employees happy. This month, <span class="companylink">Google</span> gave every employee a raise of 10 percent or more. The motivation was, in part, the ''war for talent,'' Mr. Schmidt said. People who have other job offers have been persuaded to stay with seven-figure bonuses. <span class="companylink">Google</span> says 80 percent of people who get a counteroffer stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those who leave, employees going to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> get the most attention. According to resumes posted on LinkedIn, 142 of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s 1,700 employees came from <span class="companylink">Google</span>. Mr. Schmidt dismissed the idea that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was poaching <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s best people, saying, ''We hire more people in a week than go to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> in its lifetime.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s growing pains, it remains remarkably innovative when it wants to be. Last month, for instance, it unveiled robotic cars that drive themselves. And like many big companies, <span class="companylink">Google</span> has been acquiring new technologies, like Android, instead of inventing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he worries about the consequences of becoming a big company, ''People are dying to come here and they're staying,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''So I guess they're putting up with the complexity.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ever-expanding insider trading investigations, federal prosecutors last week subpoenaed the records of Broadband Research, whose head, John Kinnucan, refused to wear a wire for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That they went after the firm and not the founder is an important legal distinction - one that means Mr. Kinnucan will have to comply, even if by doing so he incriminates himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadband Research is registered as a corporation with the Oregon Secretary of State. Only two individuals are listed on its filing: Mr. Kinnucan, president, and his wife, corporate secretary and registered agent. Like many small businesses, Broadband appears to be a one-man shop, essentially an extension of Mr. Kinnucan.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the purposes of a grand jury subpoena, the fact that Broadband Research is a corporation has important ramifications. Under the Supreme Court decision in Braswell v. United States, a corporation is a ''collective entity'' separate from its owners. So Mr. Kinnucan can't fight the subpoena by asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. While corporations have constitutional rights in some instances, including the First Amendment right to contribute money in political campaigns, they have to comply with a subpoena, even if it might incriminate the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subpoena puts Mr. Kinnucan in a rather precarious position. As the custodian of Broadband Research's records, he must oblige with the government's request; the court doesn't consider a corporate custodian to be acting in a personal capacity. Prosecutors could even force Mr. Kinnucan to appear before the grand jury to answer limited questions about the production of those records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kinnucan is not alone in having to turn over records. Hedge fund <span class="companylink">SAC Capital</span> Advisors, one of Broadband Research's clients, disclosed that it received an ''extraordinarily broad'' subpoena as part of the government's insider trading investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A subpoena could be challenged by Broadband Research on the grounds that it is overly broad, and therefore is ''unreasonable or oppressive'' under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c). The Supreme Court admonished prosecutors in R. Enterprises v. United States that ''grand juries are not licensed to engage in arbitrary fishing expeditions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subpoena challenges, however, are rarely successful. Courts are reluctant to interfere with an investigation, and the burden is on the subpoena recipient to demonstrate the request is overly broad. And even when the court actually quashes a subpoena, prosecutors can come back with a somewhat narrower one that still seeks a huge volume of records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From what Mr. Kinnucan has said publicly, the government recorded some of his telephone conversations, and it has proof that he shared confidential information used for insider trading. The broad scope of the subpoena to Broadband Research indicates prosecutors may be most interested in whether the records show that Mr. Kinnucan provided publicly available information to clients, as he's said all along. Sometimes it's just as important what's not in the files. If the Broadband Research records don't match Kinnucan's story, it could undermine a defense that no inside information was shared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors realize a company's files don't usually include a smoking gun - like a memo entitled ''My Inside Information.'' Instead, gathering records at this point in an investigation gives the government a possible preview of a potential defense. The best time to prepare for trial is before an indictment is returned. After all, the grand jury can't use its broad power to compel the production of evidence once charges are filed, at least not for that particular case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And grand jury subpoenas are usually issued at an early stage of an investigation, when the government is unsure of who might be involved in misconduct or even whether any illegal acts took place. The subpoena of Broadband Research's records may ultimately help prosecutors decide whether to file charges against Mr. Kinnucan.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like a tough sell: a game that involves catapulting birds at elaborate fortresses constructed by evil pigs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Angry Birds, a hit game by Rovio, a small Finnish company, is one of the unlikeliest pop-culture crazes of the year -- and perhaps the first to make the leap from cellphone screens to the mainstream.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angry Birds, in which the birds seek revenge on the egg-stealing pigs, is meant to be easily played in the checkout line and during other short windows of downtime -- but some players have trouble stopping. Rovio says people around the world rack up 200 million minutes of game play each day. (Put another way, that is 16 human-years of bird-throwing every hour.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game has inspired parodies, homages and fervent testimonials. Homemade Angry Birds costumes were big hits on Halloween. Conan O'Brien demonstrated the game in a <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video promoting his new show, and a sketch from an Israeli TV show about a birds-and-pigs peace treaty was popular online. Justin Bieber and other celebrities have professed their love of Angry Birds on social networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Games like Angry Birds are reaching a wide audience of players who might never consider buying an Xbox or PlayStation, but are now carrying sophisticated game machines in their pockets -- smartphones. Software developers, eager to become the next Rovio, are creating so-called casual games for this crowd, games that are easy to learn and hard to stop playing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trajectory of Angry Birds also suggests a larger shift in entertainment and in the kinds of brands that can win wide popularity. And unlike many of the best-known console video games -- like the classic Super Mario Bros. from Nintendo or the latest in the Call of Duty series, from Activision -- cellphone games like Angry Birds are often made by small companies and catch on by word of mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no more formula,'' said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Forrester Research</span> who studies digital entertainment. ''It doesn't matter where it starts: a ringtone, a video game, book. It has a shot at the big time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On cellphones, he added, ''anyone with coding skills, an idea and good characters can catch on without having to spend $100 million on a movie and marketing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anya Richardson, a technical writer and editor in Mulhall, Okla., got swept up in the Angry Birds craze when her 8-year-old son, Roenick, asked for a birthday cake based on the game. Ms. Richardson spent nearly 80 hours crafting a two-tiered concoction that included hand-shaped replicas of the game's cranky fowl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His birthday was in October, but I couldn't finish the cake until November,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her son loved the cake so much that ''he never let us cut it,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''I finally talked him into letting us get rid of it, but he kept most of the bird figures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A photo of the cake ricocheted around the Web. ''Requests from people who want one have been pouring in on Twitter and via e-mail,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Finley, 30, who works at a legal consulting firm in Los Angeles, said he and his boyfriend were such big fans of the game that they decided to create full-body bird costumes for Halloween.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was crazy,'' Mr. Finley said. ''The people who didn't recognize it didn't understand, but people who knew the game loved it. Everyone wanted to take pictures. It felt like being chased by the paparazzi or something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fans of the game took to the streets on Saturday for Angry Birds Day, celebrating its first anniversary. Rovio worked with the Web service Meetup.com to help organize the gatherings in New York, London, Jakarta, Budapest and dozens of other cities, but fans stepped up to lead the gatherings. Rovio says it will create Angry Birds levels for the top 10 cities that celebrate Angry Birds Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Rovio has released two dozen other mobile games, none have come close to the success of Angry Birds, which cost about $100,000 to make and has been downloaded 50 million times in the last year. The paid version for the iPhone, which costs 99 cents in the United States, has brought in more than $8 million in revenue; Apple said last week that it was the best-selling iPhone app of 2010. The free version for phones running <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Android software should produce $1 million a month in advertising revenue by the end of the year, Rovio says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Vesterbacka, Rovio's head of business development in North America, said the game was born when a Rovio designer sketched a rough outline of a bright red bird with a furious expression. ''We didn't know what the game concept would be, but we loved the birds,'' he said. ''The entire game and storyline was built around the birds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vesterbacka said the company took notice of the intricate storylines in Pixar films and the popularity of Mario and Luigi, from Super Mario Bros. The stars of Angry Birds do not express themselves much apart from squawks and grunts, but players seem to be connecting with them all the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When thousands of people start dressing up as your characters, you know you're onto something,'' Mr. Vesterbacka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rovio is trying to capitalize on its hit and is working on versions of Angry Birds for gaming consoles and PCs, along with a line of stuffed birds and pigs. It also hopes to spin the franchise into a movie or children's TV show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rovio made a smart choice in making the birds angry, said Jesse Schell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon who studies game design and entertainment technology. ''You can smash them into things and it's O.K.,'' he said. ''Imagine if they were cute little birds. It might be kind of funny on some level, but most people would probably be a little repulsed.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIVE years ago, after graduating from New York University with a film degree and thousands of dollars in student loans, Scott Gerber moved back in with his parents on Staten Island. He then took out more loans to start a new-media and technology company, but he didn't have a clear market in mind; the company went belly up in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It made me feel demoralized and humiliated,'' he says. ''I wondered if this was really what post-collegiate life was supposed to be like. Did I do something wrong? The answers weren't apparent to me.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still in debt, Mr. Gerber considered his career options. His mother kept encouraging him to get a ''real'' job, the kind that comes with an office and a boss. But, using the last $700 in his bank account, he decided to start another company instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the new company, called Sizzle It, Mr. Gerber vowed to find a niche, reduce overhead and generally be more frugal. The company, which specializes in short promotional videos, was profitable the first year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerber, now 27, isn't a millionaire, but he's paid off his loans and doesn't have to live with his parents (he rents an apartment in Hoboken, N.J.). And he thinks his experience can help other young people who face a daunting unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, Mr. Gerber started the Young Entrepreneur Council ''to create a shift from a resume-driven society to one where people create their own jobs,'' he says. ''The jobs are going to come from the entrepreneurial level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council consists of 80-plus business owners across the country, ages 17 to 33. Members include Scott Becker, 23, co-founder of Invite Media, an advertising technology firm recently acquired by a <span class="companylink">Google</span> unit; Lauren Berger, 26, founder of the Intern Queen, a site that connects college students with internships; Aaron Patzer, the 30-year-old who sold Mint.com to <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> for $170 million; and Josh Weinstein, 24, who started CollegeOnly.com, a social networking site that is backed by a <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council, which has applied for nonprofit status, serves as a help desk and mentoring hotline for individual entrepreneurs. People can also submit questions on subjects like marketing, publicity and technology, and each month a group of council members will answer 30 to 40 of them in business publications like The Wall Street Journal and <span class="companylink">American Express</span> Open Forum, and on dozens of small business Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Council members assert that young people can start businesses even if they have little or no money or experience. But whether those start-ups last is another matter. Roughly half of all new businesses fail within the first five years, according to federal data. And the entrepreneurial life is notoriously filled with risks, stresses and sacrifices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then again, unemployment is 9.8 percent; Mr. Gerber's in-box is flooded with e-mails from young people who have sent out hundreds of resumes for corporate jobs and come up empty. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, only 24.4 percent of 2010 graduates who applied for a job had one waiting for them after graduation (up from 19.7 percent in 2009). What do some people have to lose?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE lesson may be that entrepreneurship can be a viable career path, not a renegade choice -- especially since the promise of ''Go to college, get good grades and then get a job,'' isn't working the way it once did. The new reality has forced a whole generation to redefine what a stable job is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've seen all these people go to Wall Street, and those were supposed to be the good jobs. Now they are out of work,'' says Windsor Hanger, 22, who turned down a marketing position at Bloomingdale's to work on HerCampus.com, an online magazine. ''It's not a pure dichotomy anymore that entrepreneurship is risky and other jobs are safe, so why not do what I love?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerber argues that the tools to become an entrepreneur are more accessible than they've ever been. Thanks to the Internet, there are fewer upfront costs. A business owner can build a Web site, host conference calls, create slide presentations online through a browser, and host live meetings and Web seminars -- all on a shoestring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can't afford a Madison Avenue address? Try borrowing one instead. That is what Mr. Gerber did, for $300 a year, from ManhattanVirtualOffice.com, which forwards mail from a recognizable address. He says it saved him $100,000 in rent and gave Sizzle It the credibility it needed to start attracting clients that now include <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> and the Gap. He does most of his actual work at home and in coffee shops and shared work spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this were the 1980s, I'd need a corner office,'' says Shama Kabani, 25, a Y.E.C. member and founder of Marketing Zen, a digital marketing firm in Dallas, with yearly revenue in the seven figures. ''All you need today is a laptop, patience and willingness,'' she says. Ms. Kabani hired all of her 24 employees virtually; 15 are in the Philippines. ''I've never met any of them,'' she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Open-source software can reduce or eliminate the need for consultants and tech support. When Annie Wang, 21, co-founder of HerCampus.com, wanted the articles on the site to rotate in a slide show, she didn't hire a Web designer. She found a free online resource and spent a day teaching herself how to create the slide show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a young entrepreneur means coming up with creative ways to fill your knowledge gaps, says Eric Bahn, 29, a council member and founder of BeatTheGMAT.com, an M.B.A. applicant community that generates close to seven figures in revenue. Mr. Bahn, who does not have a technical background, found a free resource on the Web and taught himself HTML to build his site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the business owners who belong to the council did not need much physical space to start their companies. For the person who wants to start a restaurant, a bakery, an exercise studio -- or any other business that requires renting or owning property -- the barriers and expenses are still high. Mr. Gerber warns that anyone starting a brick-and-mortar business still faces the same cost barriers they always have -- including high rent. He advises young people to start a business that does not require expensive space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUT start-ups do need some financing. So Mr. Gerber is also starting the Gen Y Fund, from which young entrepreneurs can seek funding. Council members will have the option of investing in the fund starting next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could it be that the council and separate fund are mainly a way for Mr. Gerber to identify new investing opportunities? He emphatically says no, adding that helping young people succeed as entrepreneurs through the council is his passion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as the fund is concerned, ''We are looking to spearhead a major shift in how resources are allocated to our generation, because no one from above is going to do it,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of the fund is not to find the next <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or sexy Web start-up, Mr. Gerber says; instead, it will look for practicable and marketable business ideas. In fact, a favorite phrase of his is ''boring is better.'' He'll be looking for businesses that are incubated outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council and fund do add visibility to Mr. Gerber's entrepreneurial empire. In addition to running Sizzle It, Mr. Gerber writes a widely syndicated column for young entrepreneurs, and he recently published a book called ''Never Get a 'Real' Job: How to Dump Your Boss, Build a Business, and Not Go Broke.'' He also runs Gerber Enterprises, his personal investing fund, and is an investor in a restaurant group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gerber has never taken a business or economics class; he says he took a lot of people out to lunch to learn about the nuts and bolts of the business world. ''I didn't go to my third-tier upper-management boss,'' he says. ''I e-mailed people in my circle and figured who knew what I needed to know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lack of experience can actually be an asset to young business owners. When Ms. Kabani first started Marketing Zen, she tried to hide her age through a combination of wardrobe choices and trying to sound ''older.'' ''I thought I was fooling all these people, but then one of my clients told me he hired me because I was 23. He wanted someone who spoke digital as a first language, not a second. It was a mind-blowing moment for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hanger, co-founder of HerCampus.com along with Ms. Wang and Stephanie Kaplan, 22, says being young helps attract advertisers like New Balance and Juicy Couture to the site. ''They like that I am my readership. I was in college six months ago,'' she says. The site recently started turning a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY of the council members aren't bankrolled by their parents. Only a third of them received outside funding to start their businesses. In fact, Mr. Gerber's message to young entrepreneurs is ''No one will give you money'' and ''Start on a shoestring budget,'' something many of them did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many of these entrepreneurs, success didn't happen overnight. Mr. Bahn started BeatTheGMAT.com in 2005 as a blog that developed a following over the course of a few years. It was three years before he quit his day job in a general management program at <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> to work on the site full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if these 20-somethings pulled it off, the reality is a vast majority of entrepreneurs, of any age, don't succeed. ''The first business is probably going to fail,'' says Arel Moodie, 27, a Y.E.C. member and co-owner of the Extreme Entrepreneurship Tour, which educates college students on starting a business. Mr. Moodie's first two businesses -- a calendar company and a protein drink company -- flopped and put him $30,000 in debt. (He has paid it off.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Brinckerhoff, 28, who is not a member of the council, started Devver.net, an online tool to test computer software in 2008. The company folded last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brinckerhoff was formerly a software developer at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>. ''There are very real cons to starting a company. It can hurt your ego, and financially it's a big hit. If I had stayed at my old job at <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, I would have been better off financially,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The silver lining, however, was that Mr. Brinckerhoff got inquiries from 10 companies about working for them after they read on the Web or heard through word of mouth that his company had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Employers like the entrepreneurial skill set,'' he says. ''They want to hire people who are risk-takers and can make quick decisions.'' He is now working as a freelance Web and technology consultant in Boulder, Colo., and hopes to start another company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When deciding whether to start a business, ''You have to really want to do it,'' says Maia Josebachvili, 27, a council member and founder of Urban Escapes, which organizes outdoor trips. She quit her job as a derivatives trader on Wall Street to start her company, which grew to 45 employees and was recently acquired by LivingSocial, a consumer site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes a lot of discipline. I didn't eat out for the first six months, and I lived on my friend's couch,'' Ms. Josebachvili says. ''Unless you are independently wealthy, it's a lifestyle adjustment.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his way from Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore for some senior-week revelry in the early '80s, 17-year-old Gary Barbera had business on his mind. He had seen a newspaper advertisement for a 1971 Chevy Nova and decided to buy it -- not for cruising with his buddies but as an investment. Later that week, after giving the Nova a good wash and some detailing, he sold his very first car, at a profit of $360.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, the 19-year-old was running a Buick dealership. In his mid-20s, he says, he became the youngest Chrysler dealer in the country. His success continued, and he was consistently named a top-rated dealer in the mid-Atlantic region with annual sales that exceeded $100 million. He later added a General Motors dealership. His aggressive advertising -- including a 2009 commercial that featured a President Obama look-alike offering cash for clunkers -- helped make him a household name in Philadelphia.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his small-business success story took a dark turn in 2007, when the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation of Mr. Barbera's financial practices. The inquiry revealed $77,675 in unpaid taxes, mostly on a number of Chrysler ''dealer reward'' bonus checks issued in his name. The I.R.S. concluded that Mr. Barbera had been deliberately ''skimming'' income to avoid paying taxes and filed charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now 46, Mr. Barbera recently pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing false tax returns. He was ordered to pay $119,744.55 in restitution and interest plus a $30,000 fine and is serving three years' probation. Under house arrest, he wears an ankle bracelet but can go to work to run his Philadelphia dealership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Barbera's case is a cautionary tale for those owners who do not have rigorous accounting systems in place -- as well as for those who may be tempted to shield some income -- he says his business is actually recovering quite well from both the recession and his personal struggles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a condensed version of a recent conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How did you get into the car business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. My dad had a gas station and a car wash/repair center, and I worked there. Some kids want to be firemen or police. I always knew I wanted to sell cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.So what did you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I went to Kutner Buick in Northeast Philadelphia. I was 17 years old and I told the manager if I'm not the top salesman in the first month, don't hire me. I wasn't 18, so I wasn't old enough to work there. He let me sell and put the deals in someone else's name. In 1989, I shopped around for a dealership, and Chrysler was really doing bad. I was able to get in with very minimal up front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What made you a good car salesman?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Everyone says I'm a natural at marketing. It just came to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you still enjoy the business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's in my blood. It's immediate gratification. I like the constant measure of knowing how I'm doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What was your reaction when the I.R.S. began its investigation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Great. Let them look, because they're not going to find anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You didn't realize that you had unreported income for 2003 and 2004?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. At the time, of course I didn't. They weren't secret checks. But the problem was they were not picked up by the accountant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why do you say the accountant should have picked it up? If you put the check in your business account, how could he miss it? If you put it in your personal account, how could he catch it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I take full responsibility for those checks. So you say, O.K., Gary, how did it happen? I should have double-checked to make sure the accountant picked it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.But you pleaded guilty to deliberately ''skimming'' those checks, didn't you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The prosecution uses that word. They have cookie-cutter words -- ''skimming'' is one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.According to your plea agreement, most dealers have those checks made out to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You got personal checks and put them in a personal account and kept track of it in a separate set of books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. That's why I'm saying I take full responsibility for those checks not being accounted for. You can do whatever you want, but at the end of the year, you better pick up every red cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Looking back, is there anything you would do differently?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes. My accountant sent me into the I.R.S. meeting without a lawyer and without him, and everybody I talked to said you never do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What was discussed at this meeting?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Um, y'know, I really can't recall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. There's nothing in the court records that indicate you met with anyone on your own, except for one time when you pulled an I.R.S. investigator aside to say it was all your accountant's fault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, I really don't remember that either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You felt the I.R.S. was using you as a public service announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes. My opinion was that the I.R.S. doesn't have a public relations department. All they have is the media to deter people from not paying their taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What has been the most difficult aspect of this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The timing with the auto credit crisis. Chrysler went into bankruptcy and then General Motors went into bankruptcy. Timing is everything and the timing was really bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How concerned were you that your dealerships would be among the ones Chrysler let go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Not even a little bit. We bleed Chrysler. We were No. 1 for all those years. But I had just gotten G.M. within a week of when the I.R.S. came in. General Motors did not renew our contract when they came out of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you think Chrysler is going to make it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Absolutely. Third quarter, they posted a profit. The dark days are behind us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How will you do this year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. 2010 is finishing up strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Would you say it's half of what you were doing during those peak years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Probably 60 percent. But I see 2011 as above the initial forecast. The domestic auto business is coming back even faster than anyone could anticipate. The biggest problem is the access to credit. Ally [formerly GMAC] got bailed out, but I've got to tell you, they ain't doing nothing with it. Obama finally gets a small-business economic package, up to $5 million dealers can lend to their customers, and Ally isn't participating in it. It's mind-boggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How has your probation and being on house arrest affected your business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Not at all. I can go to work, I can go shopping, I can get haircuts, I go to auto auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.How cumbersome is your ankle monitor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Um, it doesn't bother me. You wouldn't even notice it. Girls wear ankle bracelets. It's my ankle bracelet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What has been the reaction from people on the street?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If you were John Smith, it wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you think your customers weren't bothered because they already have a mixed view of car dealers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'll tell you, the old cliches never die. Build a good mousetrap, they will come. In my store, our claim to fame is you'll have more inventory than if you shop all day. We take care of you in the service center. That's what's important. Especially in Philadelphia. It's union, hard-working people. In America, everyone loves a comeback, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Any advice you would give to other small-business owners as a result of what you've been through?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Keep it simple, stupid. People try to complicate things. If you're taking money, take it right through payroll.</p>

All Rights Reserved.    </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2008, Matt Dorey, founder and chief executive of Curve Dental, was at a loss. Three years into building a comprehensive Web-based software package for dentists, he felt the product was ready, but he was not sure how to make Curve a market leader. ''The company was getting complicated,'' Mr. Dorey said. ''I was starting to become conscious of what I didn't know. It was almost a feeling of loneliness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he learned of a chief executive, Jim Pack, who was looking for new opportunities after a private equity firm bought his medical-billing software company, AdvancedMD. Mr. Dorey reached out with a LinkedIn invitation. ''This was someone I had been following for four years,'' he recalled. ''He was really open about sharing knowledge and letting us know about the challenges we face. I immediately knew there was nobody better to be the C.E.O. of this company.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dorey enlisted his board and top executives in a monthslong campaign to woo Mr. Pack, who ultimately agreed. Since Mr. Pack took over as chief executive in January 2009, Curve Dental has more than doubled its staff and has introduced its software to the American market, gaining share in more than 40 states and increasing its customer base fivefold. Picking the right replacement, Mr. Dorey said, ''was the most important decision I've ever made at Curve and probably will ever make.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning over your company to a successor is not to be taken lightly. And in many cases, sticking it out might be the better option, especially if you can delegate those parts of your job that have become unmanageable. But in some instances replacing yourself at the helm makes sense. Based on the experiences of small-business owners, this guide offers suggestions on how to make that decision and accomplish the transition as painlessly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW DO YOU KNOW? Ironically, the qualities that help you succeed as an entrepreneur -- relentless optimism, willingness to tackle any challenge, a stubborn belief in yourself and your business -- also make it hard to assess your own weaknesses dispassionately. But one individual rarely possesses all the varied skills and experiences needed to take a company from idea to product introduction to sales growth to institutionalizing operations. When you hit your limit, you and your company may benefit from a leader with a fresh set of eyes and a different skill set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sequential sleepless nights can be an important warning sign, said Bo Fishback, vice president of entrepreneurship at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation -- especially if you are worrying about the same problem and unable to make headway. Other red flags include a loss of excitement when entering the workplace, or suggestions from people close to you that it might be time to scale back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When questions arise, not all owners have a choice. If you have taken venture capital money and your investors want a change, they are likely to get it. That is what happened at eBags, an online retailer based in Denver, when the board decided in April 2008 to replace the co-founder, Jon Nordmark, with an outside chief executive. ''It was personally very difficult because this is your baby,'' said Peter Cobb, an eBags senior vice president who had founded the business along with Mr. Nordmark. ''You care about it so much and you feel like nobody else will care about it as much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nordmark was replaced by Vince Jones, part of a team that helped Walmart.com reach $1 billion in sales. After watching Mr. Jones bring in talented new executives and steer the company through the recession, Mr. Cobb is convinced that replacing his business partner was the right step, noting that revenue grew even during the recession. ''We were able to grow single digits,'' he said. ''That's almost like growing 30 percent in boom times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINDING A REPLACEMENT When seeking a replacement, start with people already emotionally invested in your company. If possible, ''try before you buy,'' with a consulting or temporary role that is easier to reverse, suggested Noam T. Wasserman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. If someone must be hired from outside, make sure you and your board have repeated and extended contact with the candidate. Take your time and vet the person thoroughly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charley Moore, founder of the legal services Web site Rocket Lawyer, was not looking for a replacement when he brought on Dan Nye, a former LinkedIn chief executive, as a board member. Over the course of a few passionate conversations, Mr. Moore said, ''it became clear he was falling in love with the business.'' The pair decided that Mr. Nye would join the company as executive director to evaluate daily interactions and think about how he might fit within the team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nye brought an intense focus on customer service and an analytical approach to new products. For instance, he suggested letting customers create a free legal document before entering a credit card number to sign up for a free trial of the service. The data that followed that decision was definitive: new accounts leapt from tens of thousands a month to more than 100,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Moore was relieved to turn over day-to-day management as chief executive to Mr. Nye so he could close his door for long stretches of thinking and writing. Concentrating on both active leadership and deep analysis, Mr. Moore said, is ''almost impossible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUTLINING YOUR ROLE It may be almost impossible to find a successor who will care as much as you do, make the same decisions you would and fulfill your expectations. Ask yourself whether you can resist meddling while someone else makes critical choices for the business you built. It may be better for you to make a clean break from the company. But if you decide to stay, avoid undermining your replacement's authority by agreeing on what your new role will be and ensuring it maximizes your abilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also important to understand that you may not be able to land the best talent unless you give up the reins. Farbood Nivi, founder of Grockit, says he could not attract candidates he thought were good enough to run his education technology company until he started searching for a chief executive. ''They wouldn't talk to me if I was doing a C.O.O. search,'' said Mr. Nivi, who turned over the chief executive's office to Roy Gilbert, a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive, in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A HEALTHY TRANSITION Once you have made your choice, the next challenge is to retain the successful aspects of the company's history and culture, while injecting new energy and tackling new goals. A transition period can help the new leader learn the ropes while giving you the comfort level you need to let go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a hair care company, Ouidad Holdings, the founder, Ouidad, who grew up in Lebanon and goes by one name, worked hand-in-hand with the new president, Hillary Solomon, for the first three years Ms. Solomon held the post. This August, Ouidad took her first monthlong family vacation since starting her salon in 1984 -- a long-awaited respite that prompted her to agree to outside investment and hiring a president in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I want to tell other entrepreneurs is that it's a very, very tough thing to do,'' Ouidad said. ''It is a partnership. You build it and when you feel comfortable, it's just like your husband.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a cattle ranch in the country's northeast to a gym in Beijing, Jade Gray has been involved in his share of start-ups since arriving in China from New Zealand in 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is therefore no stranger to China's many rules on investing in the country.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very laborious process, and there a lot of hoops to jump through,'' said Mr. Gray, who began his fifth venture, the Gung Ho! Gourmet Pizza Factory delivery service, with a fellow New Zealander a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's limits on the use of its currency, the renminbi, in foreign trade and investment have been in the spotlight for the way they help Beijing manage the renminbi's exchange rate and arguably tilt the direction of trade in China's favor. But when it comes to doing business in China, Mr. Gray and other experts say, China's capital controls pose only a minor aggravation for foreign investors willing to do their homework. ''It's loosened up a lot in the past 5 to 10 years,'' Mr. Gray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China may be the world's second-largest economy after the United States, and the largest exporter, but the renminbi remains almost unheard of in international currency flows. ''There are technically very few ways for renminbi to flow out of China,'' said Christopher Xing, who advises on Chinese taxes at KPMG in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is because when China began opening up its economy in the 1980s, it decided against opening its currency market to avoid the kind of money inflows and outflows that can blunt a central bank's ability to manage an economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best example of the perils of an internationally convertible currency is none other than the United States. ''The problem with the U.S. is that the U.S. dollar is not only the dollar of the U.S. economy, but the dollar of the international economy,'' said Ye Xiang, a former economist at the Chinese central bank who is now co-head of a fund management firm in Hong Kong. ''So when the Fed wants to reduce interest rates and put liquidity into the U.S., liquidity will flow out and go into international markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it may be many companies' dream to sell to the 1.3 billion Chinese, getting money into China to set up is a formidable hurdle. ''This is the biggest challenge in terms of setting up your business,'' said Mr. Gray, who started Gung Ho! with an initial investment of $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A foreign company cannot convert a single dollar into renminbi -- whether to open a bank account, hire an employee or lease an office -- without first getting investment approval from the local branch of the Ministry of Commerce. ''If you want to bring in money into China for investment purposes, you need to have a project approved by the government,'' said Flora Sun, director of the China office in Shanghai of the consulting firm Brian Cave International Trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process is different for investors who want to buy Chinese stocks. Once largely off limits to foreigners, China began in 2003 allowing some foreign investors to become qualified foreign institutional investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For businesses that want to start ventures in China, the easiest path may be to first set up a sales representative office, experts advise. But that means not being able to book any sales inside of China. Another route is to set up a joint venture with a Chinese partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third option is to establish a wholly foreign-owned enterprise. Approval depends on whether the investment is in an industry prohibited for foreign investment, like, say, agriculture or publishing. If the proposed investment is not restricted and is below $300 million, it can be approved by the municipal or provincial authorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anything larger has to go to the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing. If the proposed investment is in a restricted industry, the investment limit for local approval falls to $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the investment is approved and a business license is issued, the company has to get approval to convert its investment into renminbi from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And only after getting that can a foreign company open a local bank account and start spending money in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This presents some investors with a Catch-22: they need to invest renminbi to get approvals but cannot until they have approval to invest. One solution, Mr. Xing said, is to open a pre-investment bank account. This allows companies to spend up to $100,000 to set up their businesses and get investment approval, with the amount spent counted toward the new venture's approved investment capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approved investment amount is an important number. It represents the maximum amount of capital the company can bring into China and convert into renminbi. If a foreign company wants to bring in more, it needs to get the investment reapproved through largely the same process, which can take up to two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, some companies tend to apply for a larger amount of investment than they think they need, just in case, which leaves them with a surplus of cash sitting in a Chinese bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another strategy is to mix start-up investment capital with loans from the company's owners, Mr. Xing said. The larger the investment, the more China allows the new venture to borrow. So while investors of $3 million or less can borrow only up to 30 percent of their total approved investment, those of $30 million or more can borrow up to two-thirds of their start-up capital, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the mix, the company cannot convert any of its approved investment without proper documentation to show the bank. ''They won't allow you to convert U.S. dollars into renminbi immediately,'' Mr. Ye said. Investors need to show their bank an invoice or service agreement to convert their deposits and spend them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies in China have to provide documentation -- an invoice and customs declarations -- to convert renminbi into foreign currency to purchase goods abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, China has begun a pilot program that allows banks in a number of cities and provinces to settle cross-border trades in renminbi, part of a gradual effort by China to promote the use of its currency in international trade. But the transactions have to be approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and the counterparties must be in Asia, Mr. Xing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China also regulates how foreign companies can repatriate their profit. Companies need to make sure they have paid corporate taxes first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China then requires that they put 10 percent of their earnings into a general reserve. They can then apply to pay the remainder as dividends to their foreign owners by showing their books and a board resolution. China charges a 10 percent withholding tax on the payment, a relatively low amount in Asia, according to experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China also charges a 10 percent withholding tax on interest payments, as well as a 5 percent business tax. But there is no tax on repayments of loan principal, which is one reason why Mr. Xing says repaying shareholder loans can be more advantageous to foreign companies from a tax perspective than paying out dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this seems complicated, experts say, it pales next to the complexities of China's rapidly changing business scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've got competition and consumers changing their demands and needs at an incredible rate,'' Mr. Gray said. Selling pizzas topped with gourmet ingredients like grilled herb chicken and wine-soaked black currants, Camembert cheese and fresh herbs, he said, is aimed at Beijing's increasingly affluent diners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no doing formulas,'' he said of making a go of it in China. ''You just shoot in the dark. That's where experience comes in.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI, India -- Microcredit is losing its halo in many developing countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microcredit was once extolled by world leaders like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair as a powerful tool that could help eliminate poverty, through loans as small as $50 to cowherds, basket weavers and other poor people for starting or expanding businesses. But now microloans have prompted political hostility in Bangladesh, India, Nicaragua and other developing countries.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheik Hasina Wazed, who had championed microloans alongside President Clinton at talks in Washington in 1997, turned her back on them. She said microlenders were ''sucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation,'' and she ordered an investigation into <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span>, which had pioneered microcredit and, with its founder, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in India, until recently home to the world's fastest-growing microcredit businesses, lending has slowed sharply since the state with the most microloans adopted a strict law restricting lending. In Nicaragua, Pakistan and Bolivia, activists and politicians have urged borrowers not to repay their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hostility toward microfinance is a sharp reversal from the praise and good will that politicians, social workers and bankers showered on the sector in the last decade. Philanthropists and investors poured billions of dollars into nonprofit and profit-making microlenders, who were considered vital players in achieving the United Nations' ambitious Millennium Development Goals for 2015 that world leaders set in 2000. One of the goals was to reduce by half the number of people in extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attention lavished on microcredit helped the sector reach more than 91 million customers, most of them women, with loans totaling more than $70 billion by the end of 2009. India and Bangladesh together account for half of all borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as with other trumpeted development initiatives that have promised to lift hundreds of millions from poverty, microcredit has struggled to turn rhetoric into tangible success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Done right, these loans have shown promise in allowing some borrowers to build sustainable livelihoods. But it has also become clear that the rapid growth of microcredit -- in India some lending firms were growing at 60 percent to 100 percent a year -- has made the loans much less effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most borrowers do not appear to be climbing out of poverty, and a sizable minority is getting trapped in a spiral of debt, according to studies and analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Credit is both the source of possibilities and it's a bond,'' said David Roodman, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a research organization in Washington. ''Credit is often operating at this knife's edge, and that gets forgotten.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the results for borrowers have been mixed, some lenders have minted profits that might make Wall Street bankers envious. For instance, investors in India's largest microcredit firm, <span class="companylink">SKS Microfinance</span>, sold shares last year for as much as 95 times what they paid for them a few years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, politicians in developing nations, some of whom had long resented microlenders as competitors for the hearts and minds of the poor, have taken to depicting lenders as profiteering at the expense of borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, for example, supported ''movimiento no pago,'' or the no-pay movement, which was started in 2008 by farmers after some borrowers could not pay their debts. Partly as a result of that campaign, a judge recently ordered the liquidation of one of the country's leading microlenders, Banco del Exito, or Success Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These crises happen when the microfinance sector gets saturated, when it grows too fast, and the mechanisms for controlling overindebtedness is not very well developed,'' said Elisabeth Rhyne, a senior official at <span class="companylink">Accion International</span>, a organization in Boston that invests in microlenders. ''On the political side, politicians or political actors take advantage of an opportunity. When they see grievances, they go, 'Wow, we can make some hay with this.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a broad thread of resentment and disenchantment runs across the globe, the hostility toward microcredit stems from different circumstances in each nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bangladesh, Ms. Hasina appears to have become embittered with Grameen after its founder, Muhammad Yunus, who shared the Nobel, announced in 2007 that he would start a political party. At that time, the country was ruled by a caretaker government appointed by the military. Though Mr. Yunus later gave up on the idea, analysts say Ms. Hasina and Mr. Yunus have not made amends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hasina's recent comments about microcredit were prompted by a Norwegian documentary that accused Grameen of improperly transferring to an affiliate $100 million that Norway had donated to it more than a decade ago. Ms. Hasina said Grameen, 3.4 percent of which is owned by the government, might have transferred the money to avoid taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank, which has denied that accusation, reversed the transfer after Norwegian officials objected to it. Norway recently issued a statement clearing Grameen of wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime minister's press secretary did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In India, leaders in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for about a third of the country's microloans, have accused lenders of impoverishing customers. Stories proliferated in the local news media about women who had amassed debts of $1,000 or more as loan officers cajoled them into borrowing more than they could afford and then browbeat them to repay. Many had used the money to pay for televisions or health care or to soften the blow of failed crops, rather than as seed money for businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microcredit firms in India were also accused of siphoning borrowers from government-run ''self-help groups'' -- women's organizations that can borrow small amounts at subsidized interest rates from government-owned banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movement against microcredit was started by opposition politicians, who have encouraged borrowers not to repay their loans and have accused senior leaders of the ruling Congress Party of being in cahoots with lenders. The Congress-led state government made the cause its own and passed a tough new law in December to cap interest rates and regulate collections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis has had ripples across the nation. Banks, the primary source of money for microlenders, have turned off the tap because they are worried about the industry's future. As a result, microlenders have slowed or stopped lending nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grameen Financial Services, a microlender in Bangalore that is not related to <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span>, has idled 600 new employees it hired just a few months earlier with plans to expand into western and central India. The firm does not lend in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is frustrating,'' said Suresh K. Krishna, managing director of Grameen Financial. ''This is not what we set out for. The whole objective of floating this was to support entrepreneurs and support people in the rural areas and people below the poverty line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry leaders say they hope the issues will be resolved soon. The federal government and the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>, the country's central bank, are working on new federal regulations to oversee microcredit, said Alok Prasad, chief executive of the Microfinance Institutions Network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some industry officials acknowledge that the sector needs to reform itself to overcome political opposition and live up to its promise. They say organizations that now offer only loans need to diversify into microsavings accounts, which many specialists assert are much better than loans at easing poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry, they say, also needs to speed up efforts to build a credit bureau that would reduce overlending. And organizations need to measure their success not just by growth and profits, but by how fast their customers are getting out of poverty, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We at microfinance have a job to do to make it easier for politicians to support us,'' said Alex Counts, the chief executive of the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit in Washington that is not part of <span class="companylink">Grameen Bank</span>. ''Rather than make claims that get out in front of the research, we need to impose on ourselves the discipline of transparency about poverty reduction.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In business, numbers usually tell the story. If you use them to judge 2010, it was probably a better year for small businesses than 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, for example -- the most recent period for which the data are available -- there was a net loss of 96,000 companies with fewer than 100 employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2009, the loss was 400,000 companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numbers, however, do not tell the whole story. Behind every one of those small businesses that failed was an entrepreneur with an idea and a dream. ''It was very painful,'' said one of those owners, Elizabeth Kavanaugh, whose 12-year-old business, Large Format Digital, closed in March. ''My husband and I are still struggling with the aftermath.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Hedlund, co-founder of Wesabe, a now-defunct personal finance site, wrote on his blog that while he was ''enormously sad'' about the closing of his business, he hoped that by writing about the difficulties Wesabe faced he would ''inform other people who try to start companies in the future.'' In that spirit, here are the stories of six small businesses that closed their doors in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wesabe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A personal finance Web site based in San Francisco. Wesabe opened in 2006 and closed in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK Wesabe was one of the first movers in the Web 2.0 financial space. Its founders, Mr. Hedlund and Jason Knight, envisioned a site that would help consumers budget their money and make better spending decisions. The company received two rounds of venture capital financing totaling $4.7 million and signed up 150,000 members in its first year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG Ten months after Wesabe's introduction, a competitor, Mint.com, appeared. As Mr. Hedlund acknowledges, Mint had a better name and better design and was easier to use. Within nine months, Mint had 300,000 users and $17 million in venture financing. In 2009, Mint was sold to <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> for $170 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK Mr. Hedlund wishes he had simplified the consumer's experience. ''We wanted to help people,'' he said, ''but it was too much work to get that help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gotham Concierge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A personal assistance and professional organizing service in Manhattan, Gotham Concierge opened in 2004 and closed in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK In the summer of 2008, Alison Kero, Gotham's founder, was running errands and handling tasks for more clients than she could handle, from busy housewives to disorganized lawyers and hedge fund managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG As home prices and the stock market plummeted in the fall of 2008, Ms. Kero's clients began cutting back. She spent thousands of dollars on advertising that did not work. Worse, she became increasingly frustrated with the tedium of running errands. In July, when one of her two remaining clients forgot about a meeting -- and then blamed Ms. Kero for not reminding her about it -- she decided to close up shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK ''I realize now I didn't love what I did,'' she said. ''I loved running a business.'' In late October, she moved to Denver and started a pet care business, Alicat Pet Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">iParents.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A social network for parents and families, based in Wyncote, Pa., iParents.com opened in 2008 and closed in January 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK Don Milley founded iParents.com when <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was still gaining traction with middle-aged people. ''iParents was a place where family members would be able to interact with each other online, share schedules, news, photos and coordinate activities,'' Mr. Milley said. Nine months after opening, the site had 70,000 members and venture capitalists were interested in investing about $3 million -- if the network could get to 100,000 members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG Too much time and money were spent on enhanced functionality, like text-alert reminders about appointments and the ability to turn family photos into refrigerator magnets. ''All the bells and whistles diluted our premise -- to be a community for parents and families,'' Mr. Milley said. In late 2009, he hired a marketing company in Florida to do online outreach and run a photo contest to try to get to 100,000 members. He paid $18,000 for the work and never heard from the company again. ''That was the death knell for us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK Although <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> was a competitor, Mr. Milley felt there was ample room for iParents, too: ''The cause of death was really a lack of focus on building a community -- that, and we ran out of working capital.'' In November, Mr. Milley started PerDiemDeals.com, which sells Groupon-style coupons to small-business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large Format Digital</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based in Edgerton, Wis., the company printed advertisements on the side panels of trucks. It opened in 1998 and closed in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK In 2006, business took off, growing about 60 percent a year until 2008. In 2007, sales were $3 million and the company had 15 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG When the business was growing, Ms. Kavanaugh and Jeff Rank, her co-founder and husband, decided to spend $1 million to build their own installation facility, which they believed would save them money in the long term. The mortgage closed on the same day in September 2008 that <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> filed for bankruptcy. Within a month, Large Format's workload fell 50 percent. ''It was literally like someone turned off a faucet,'' said Ms. Kavanaugh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK ''I wish I had spoken to an attorney right after the closing and a C.P.A. with small-business expertise,'' said Ms. Kavanaugh. ''Maybe they would have told us we didn't have to go through with building.'' Her remaining six employees bought her customer list and started a similar company, Fetch Graphics. Ms. Kavanaugh was hired as social program manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Varvitsiotis Architecture</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based in Eugene, Ore., the firm did mostly commercial work. It opened in 1996 and closed in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK In 2008, Varvitsiotis had six employees, more than half a million dollars in annual revenue and five projects under way -- enough work for two years. Richard Barbis, the founder, had plans to build the business into a 15- to 20-person firm and was grooming two employees to be partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG When the stock market fell in 2008, clients started to cancel projects. Too much of the company's work was in the private sector, Mr. Barbis said, as opposed to the public sector where many projects were financed with government stimulus money. With work scarce, bigger firms started competing with Varvitsiotis for the smaller projects it usually landed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK ''We were hit from all sides,'' said Mr. Barbis. His new business, Opa Cove, sells sporting good products for children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Petite Palate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gourmet baby food company based in Long Island City, N.Y., Petite Palate opened in 2006 and closed in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT ITS PEAK In the spring of 2007, Petite Palate's organic frozen baby food was sold on Amazon Grocery and in about 100 stores in the Northeast and Midwest. The founders, Lisa Beels, a personal chef, and Christine Naylor, a former cookbook publicist, were presenting their business plan to potential investors, hoping to raise $2.5 million to $5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT WENT WRONG In the fall of 2008, potential investors, skittish about the economy, pulled out. The company was struggling to get its products into the freezer section of grocery stores -- yet Ms. Beels and Ms. Naylor stuck to their concept because they believed frozen food was healthier for children than food in jars or pouches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOKING BACK Ms. Beels said she and Ms. Naylor should have been more open to producing shelf-stable formulations. ''It took us a long time to acknowledge that and by then we were in debt and couldn't support the company,'' Ms. Beels said. Her new personal chef business is called Haute Palate.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executive Limousine operates a fleet that includes town cars, stretch limos and party buses. The company, which is based in Bellmore, N.Y., offers travel options that range from airport transportation to bachelor parties and winery tours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many businesses that went online years ago, it began with modest expectations. ''We launched our first Web site about 11 years ago,'' said Douglas Schwartz, the company president, ''and for the first six or seven, I thought the Web site was an online brochure for us to send clients to. I held on to the original Web site for years thinking it was great; boy, was I a fool!''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site did not drive much business until Mr. Schwartz decided to promote it actively. ''About three years ago,'' he said, ''someone turned me on to <span class="companylink">Google</span> AdWords. I launched a small campaign and discovered that people could find us online.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schwartz took the $2,000 a month he had been investing in phone books and put that money into online advertising. For the last few years, he has been weaning the company off print advertising, focusing instead on both pay-per-click advertising and search engine optimization. He has been relying heavily on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Reach Local, which places ads on multiple sites aimed at a business's local audience. ''I am sure we have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on pay-per-click campaigns,'' he said. ''We are presently running $5,000 per month with Reach Local, $1,500 with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and I don't even know how many man hours on S.E.O.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, 85 percent of Executive Limousine's business comes from the Internet. While pleased, Mr. Schwartz is constantly working to fine-tune his online advertising to generate a higher return on his investment. He also is looking to improve his S.E.O. performance. The company operates in a highly competitive market -- the New York metropolitan area -- and has dozens of competitors chasing the same audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When analyzing a Web site, I like to ask four questions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executive Limousine's home page offers a phone number to call, a request-a-quote button, a click-for-live-chat feature, an e-mail address for making reservations and an invitation to join the site's e-mail list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does the site offer clear messaging?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you can see, the home page features photographs of the company's limousines, cars and party buses. And the navigation column on the left suggests lots of ways to use them: holiday packages, Sweet Sixteen parties, nights on the town. There are also eye-catching discount offers. The top navigation presents links to the company blog, a flight tracker and the company profile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interior pages offer descriptions of each service. For example, the Sweet Sixteen page provides content that would be of interest to high school students, while offering reassurance to parents with a series of safety points, including a strict no-alcohol policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does the site have features that make it sticky?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, does the site offer elements that will make visitors stick around and return as repeat visitors. The main sticky feature on this site is the blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the blog post illustrated above, Executive Limousine does not push its own services. Instead, it offers useful information about places to visit. Other blog posts have suggested holiday windows to view, top 10 winter getaways (by limo, of course) and 10 tips for getting lower airfares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sticky features include videos that describe the company's services and give tours of the fleet, including the new party bus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does it integrate social media?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executive Limousine uses both <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> to get the company's message out and to engage clients. The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page promotes and links to the blog. It offers special discounts, highlights testimonials and promotes upcoming events in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Please take a look at the site. What features do you like? What's missing? What's confusing? What needs to be improved? Is it easy to find the site by searching for it on <span class="companylink">Google</span> and on other search engines? Use the search terms you would use if you were looking for a limousine service in New York. Most important, think about why Executive Limousine has to spend so much money on pay-per-click advertising and what could be done to improve its S.E.O.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis Leary's takeover of the House of Shields, one of San Francisco's coolest old bars, was as artful as a classic cocktail -- stirred by hand, and ever so slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leary, the owner of three downtown restaurants -- including Canteen and Golden West -- coveted the historic House of Shields at 39 New Montgomery Street, but lacked the money to buy it outright.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1908, the bar was named after its founder, Eddie Shields, who is thought to have been ''an associate in the boxing world,'' said James F. Jarvis, a local historian of the city's drinking establishments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of having the bar also appealed to Mr. Leary's Luddite nature. ''Everyone has friends on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>,'' Mr. Leary said, ''but a bar is one of the last places people converse face to face.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the sandwich shop next to the House of Shields became available. Mr. Leary had learned that the bar's lease was up in 2010, so he rented the shop to serve as his lookout where he could become acquainted with the owners of the entire building, the Sharon Building. He named his new restaurant the Sentinel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leary has been interested in old properties since his teenage years, when he washed dishes at the Parker House Hotel in Boston where the classic rolls were created and Malcolm X worked as a busboy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he opened the Sentinel in May 2008, Mr. Leary took care to restore the establishment, applying a lot of elbow grease and uncovering old cigar signs and other original details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Bernheim, vice president of Coast Counties Property Management, whose family has owned the Chicago-style Sharon Building for generations, was impressed by Mr. Leary's efforts -- so impressed that in May 2009, the management company awarded him first right of refusal on the lease for the House of Shields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a lot of interest in Shields,'' Mr. Bernheim said. ''But Dennis's track record shows he does what he says he's going to do, and he does it right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lease expired June 30; Mr. Leary took over and immediately closed the bar for renovations. It reopened in December with reupholstered booths and hand-blown glass sconces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernheim turned down several offers to lease the House of Shields, including one from H. Joseph Ehrmann, owner of the Elixir saloon in the Mission district and a founder of the Barbary Coast Conservancy of the American Cocktail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although disappointed not to get the lease, Mr. Ehrmann was supportive of Mr. Leary and put him in touch with Thomas Nolan, son of one of the early owners of the House of Shields, who gave the new House of Shields proprietor a jar of the family eggnog. Today the recipe sits on Mr. Leary's desk; he may add it to a bar menu later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the House of Shields is well situated to benefit from the increase in foot traffic projected to arrive with the new Transbay Transit Center, scheduled to open nearby in 2017. All Mr. Leary has to do is wait.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following is the transcript for President Obama's second State of the Union address on Tuesday, as released by the White House:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner. (Applause.) And as we mark this occasion, we're also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague -- and our friend - Gabby Giffords. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a robust democracy demands. That's what helps set us apart as a nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater - something more consequential than party or political preference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, too, is what sets us apart as a nation. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of cooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I believe we can. And I believe we must. That's what the people who sent us here expect of us. With their votes, they've determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will move forward together, or not at all - for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake right now is not who wins the next election - after all, we just had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else. It's whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It's whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer. By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise. By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the project the American people want us to work on. Together. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We did that in December. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans' paychecks are a little bigger today. Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year. And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we have to do more. These steps we've taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we'll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown. You didn't always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are you'd have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion. Maybe you'd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. I've seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I've heard it in the frustrations of Americans who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear - proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're right. The rules have changed. In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business. Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100. Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there's an Internet connection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science. They're investing in research and new technologies. Just recently, China became the home to the world's largest private solar research facility, and the world's fastest computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn't discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember - for all the hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. (Applause.) No workers -- no workers are more productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs. We're the home to the world's best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea - the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny. That's why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here. It's why our students don't just memorize equations, but answer questions like ''What do you think of that idea? What would you change about the world? What do you want to be when you grow up?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can't just stand still. As Robert Kennedy told us, ''The future is not a gift. It is an achievement.'' Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now it's our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time. We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. (Applause.) We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government. That's how our people will prosper. That's how we'll win the future. (Applause.) And tonight, I'd like to talk about how we get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation. None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from. Thirty years ago, we couldn't know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do -- what America does better than anyone else -- is spark the creativity and imagination of our people. We're the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. In America, innovation doesn't just change our lives. It is how we make our living. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because it's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need. That's what planted the seeds for the Internet. That's what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS. Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon. The science wasn't even there yet. NASA didn't exist. But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is our generation's Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen since the height of the Space Race. And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal. We'll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology - (applause) -- an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, we're seeing the promise of renewable energy. Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company. After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon. But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard. Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country. In Robert's words, ''We reinvented ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves. And to spur on more success stories like the <span class="companylink">Allen Brothers</span>, we've begun to reinvent our energy policy. We're not just handing out money. We're issuing a challenge. We're telling America's scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we'll fund the Apollo projects of our time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they're using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities. With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I'm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies. (Applause.) I don't know if -- I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their own. (Laughter.) So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling. So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America's success. But if we want to win the future - if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas - then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us - as citizens, and as parents - are willing to do what's necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities. It's family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair. (Applause.) We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many schools don't meet this test. That's why instead of just pouring money into a system that's not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top. To all 50 states, we said, ''If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we'll show you the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation. For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning. And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country. And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that's more flexible and focused on what's best for our kids. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see, we know what's possible from our children when reform isn't just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities. Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs. But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their families to go to college. And after the first year of the school's transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, ''Thank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.'' (Applause.) That's what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as ''nation builders.'' Here in America, it's time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect. (Applause.) We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. (Applause.) And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, to every young person listening tonight who's contemplating their career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher. Your country needs you. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma. To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American. (Applause.) That's why we've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students. (Applause.) And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit - worth $10,000 for four years of college. It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today's fast-changing economy, we're also revitalizing America's community colleges. Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina. Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old. And she told me she's earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too. As Kathy said, ''I hope it tells them to never give up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we take these steps - if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take - we will reach the goal that I set two years ago: By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One last point about education. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens. Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities. But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us. It makes no sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration. And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows. (Applause.) I know that debate will be difficult. I know it will take time. But tonight, let's agree to make that effort. And let's stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped. South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports. Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation's infrastructure, they gave us a ''D.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to do better. America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System. The jobs created by these projects didn't just come from laying down track or pavement. They came from businesses that opened near a town's new train station or the new off-ramp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So over the last two years, we've begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry. And tonight, I'm proposing that we redouble those efforts. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We'll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what's best for the economy, not politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail. (Applause.) This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than flying - without the pat-down. (Laughter and applause.) As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the next five years, we'll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans. This isn't just about -- (applause) -- this isn't about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls. It's about connecting every part of America to the digital age. It's about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world. It's about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these investments - in innovation, education, and infrastructure - will make America a better place to do business and create jobs. But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to change. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years - without adding to our deficit. It can be done. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 - because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up. Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States. And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs. That's what we did with Korea, and that's what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. (Applause.) But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people. (Applause.) That's what we've done in this country for more than a century. It's why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It's why we have speed limits and child labor laws. It's why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. (Applause.) And it's why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law. (Laughter.) So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved. If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I'm not willing to do -- what I'm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered. I'm not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees. As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients' -- parents' coverage. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let's fix what needs fixing and let's move forward. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren't buried under a mountain of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. (Applause.) Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we've frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years. I've proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs. The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without. But let's make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. (Applause.) And let's make sure that what we're cutting is really excess weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may make you feel like you're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you feel the impact. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, most of the cuts and savings I've proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It won't. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear. I don't agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it - in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit. The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit. Still, I'm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations. (Applause.) We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. (Applause.) Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break. It's not a matter of punishing their success. It's about promoting America's success. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code. (Applause.) This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress - Democrats and Republicans - to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done. If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me take this one step further. We shouldn't just give our people a government that's more affordable. We should give them a government that's more competent and more efficient. We can't win the future with a government of the past. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater. (Laughter.) I hear it gets even more complicated once they're smoked. (Laughter and applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, we've made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We're selling acres of federal office space that hasn't been used in years, and we'll cut through red tape to get rid of more. But we need to think bigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote - and we will push to get it passed. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming year, we'll also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of government. Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you'll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history. Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online. And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it. I will veto it. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 21st century government that's open and competent. A government that lives within its means. An economy that's driven by new skills and new ideas. Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation. It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges. No single wall separates East and West. No one rival superpower is aligned against us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion. And America's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity. And because we've begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America's standing has been restored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high. (Applause.) American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed. This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq. America's commitment has been kept. The Iraq war is coming to an end. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we're disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies. And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces. Our purpose is clear: By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them. This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pakistan, al Qaeda's leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield. Their safe havens are shrinking. And we've sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war. Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed. Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is just a part of how we're shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity. With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense. We've reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas. Around the globe, we're standing with those who take responsibility - helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power - it must also be the purpose behind it. In south Sudan - with our assistance - the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war. (Applause.) Thousands lined up before dawn. People danced in the streets. One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him: ''This was a battlefield for most of my life,'' he said. ''Now we want to be free.'' (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And tonight, let us be clear: The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must never forget that the things we've struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families. Let us serve them as well as they've served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our troops come from every corner of this country - they're black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim. And, yes, we know that some of them are gay. Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love. (Applause.) And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one nation. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit - none of this will be easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder because we will argue about everything. The costs. The details. The letter of every law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some countries don't have this problem. If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed. If they don't want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn't get written.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn't a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try. We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible. No matter who you are. No matter where you come from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight. That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me. (Laughter and applause.) That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dream - that American Dream - is what drove the <span class="companylink">Allen Brothers</span> to reinvent their roofing company for a new era. It's what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future. And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology. And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment. And Brandon left for Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep. Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued. (Applause.) But because he didn't want all of the attention, Brandon wasn't there when the miners emerged. He'd already gone back home, back to work on his next project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, ''We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.'' (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do big things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That's how we win the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're a nation that says, ''I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.'' ''I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.'' ''I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.'' ''I'm not sure how we'll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we'll get there. I know we will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do big things. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And tonight, more than two centuries later, it's because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 1956, a hardware store manager named Joseph Mancuso converted an abandoned 850,000-square-foot manufacturing complex in Batavia, N.Y., into a new kind of facility he called the Batavia Industrial Center.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only would tenants receive office space, they would gain access to other entrepreneurs and experts willing to dole out business advice. Several businesses soon came calling, including a winery, a charitable organization and a chicken processor. It was Mr. Mancuso who, after seeing newly hatched chicks running around the facility, began calling it an ''incubator.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there are about 1,200 business incubators in the United States. Most cater to a variety of businesses, according to Linda Knopp, director of policy analysis and research at the National Business Incubation Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporting such programs, most of which operate as nonprofits, has become a staple for many local governments and universities seeking to attract and retain entrepreneurial talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have also been profit-making programs like <span class="companylink">Idealab</span>, a technology incubator started by the serial entrepreneur Bill Gross in 1996 in Pasadena, Calif. (CitySearch was an early success).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, there has been a rise in so-called virtual incubators like Entrepreneur Commons and Open Coffee Club, which are really social networks that try to provide the mentoring and collaborative benefits of an incubator without the physical space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following guide breaks down the four most common types of incubator and offers tips on identifying which might be best for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Classic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROGRAM Like Mr. Mancuso's original, these incubators operate out of a shared building where tenants have subsidized rent, access to computers, office equipment, staff members and experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Fee-based, ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a month, which covers expenses like office space, equipment rental and kitchen access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXIT RULES Most programs expect tenants to ''graduate'' within three to five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLESCambridge Innovation Center (Cambridge, Mass.), TechColumbus (Columbus, Ohio).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEST FOR First-timers or those looking to connect in new industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS It is based on shared knowledge, said Tim Rowe, founder and chief executive of the Cambridge Innovation Center, which houses 300 early-stage companies in a facility owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tenants pay from $250 a month to $1,100 a month per person with no limit on how long they can stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRADUATES SAY David Rose has founded two medical device companies, <span class="companylink">Ambient Devices</span> and Vitality, at the Cambridge center: ''There is a viral energy and camaraderie. You can get a lot of good advice simply by walking into the elevator.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTIONS TO ASK Can you break the lease? What kinds of companies are current tenants starting? Will the incubator give you contact information for former tenants? What kinds of experiences do staff members have? Will you have contact with outside professionals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROGRAM Offers access to equipment and experienced staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Typically free (some programs offer grants) but limited to current students or alumni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXIT RULES Many programs expect the company to graduate when the student does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLESARCH New Business Incubator at the University of Chicago, Darden Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEST FOR Student entrepreneurs looking to spend the summer or school year fleshing out an idea with the help of professors, fellow students and alumni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS Budding entrepreneurs at the University of Virginia's business incubator, for example, are given a $13,000 stipend and coaching and feedback on their business plans. Participants can also attend lectures and workshops on topics like intellectual property and accounting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRADUATES SAY George Aspland, Scott Roberts and Adam Rodnitzky graduated in 2008 from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. Unlike many of their classmates who turned their M.B.A.'s into jobs on Wall Street or with big companies, they decided to start a business together and enrolled in the ARCH incubator. Within a year, their company, ReTel Technologies, had a plan to use crowd- sourcing to analyze surveillance videos. ''Our time in the incubator helped us reorient and come up with a plan we could execute,'' Mr. Rodnitzky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTIONS TO ASK Does the program offer a stipend? What restrictions come with the money? Who are the professors and the staff members who will be advising you and what kinds of experiences do they have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Niche</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROGRAM Most niche incubators offer facilities and advice at a reduced cost to companies with a specialized focus -- for example, food or social entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Typically fee-based although some programs take equity stakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXIT RULES Most operate like the classic model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLESBlue Ridge Food Ventures (Asheville, N.C.); Sparkseed (San Francisco).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEST FOR First-timers who require specialized instruction or access to specialized equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS Many aspiring food entrepreneurs think they can make a few dollars selling cookies made with their grandmother's secret recipe, said Mary Lou Surgi, executive director of Blue Ridge Food Ventures, but most do not have the equipment or the wherewithal to build a business. At Blue Ridge, they can also take classes offered by Ms. Surgi: ''Most people that come here have never even thought of things like food safety or how to market and distribute their product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRADUATES SAY Jeannine Buscher and Sarah Schomber, the founders of Buchi, which makes fermented and unpasteurized tea: ''We could never have afforded the kind of place we have now two years ago,'' Ms. Buscher said. ''It's hard to say what kind of business we would have today if we didn't have Blue Ridge Food Ventures to help us get started.'' They started out in Ms. Buscher's dining room but now brew their bottled beverages in a 6,000-foot-facility of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTIONS TO ASK What kinds of companies are current tenants starting? Will the incubator give you contact information for former tenants? What kinds of experiences have staff members had? Are they knowledgeable about the specific kind of business you are considering?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Accelerator</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROGRAM Most accelerators, which are run by groups of experienced business owners and investors, require entrepreneurs to move to a facility for a specified amount of time. Eventually, they are given the opportunity to market their businesses to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COST Typically a 6 percent equity stake in return for about $18,000 in seed financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXIT RULES Programs usually last for 90 days, although companies can continue to use the program's network of mentors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXAMPLESTechStars (Boston; Boulder, Colo.; New York; Portland, Ore.), Y Combinator (San Francisco); Joystick Labs (Raleigh, N.C.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEST FOR Fast-growth companies that want to attract investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW IT WORKS You get 90 days of intense focus from a team of experienced entrepreneurs and investors, said Brad Feld, co-founder of TechStars. While TechStars aims at technology companies, Y Combinator accepts a wide variety of companies. The Brandery, in Cincinnati, provides 90 days of feedback on a company's marketing and advertising strategies. Joystick Labs accepts only entrepreneurs interested in building gaming companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRADUATES SAY Lina Chen, chief executive of Nix Hydra Games, moved from Shanghai to Raleigh to connect with smart, ambitious people at Joystick Labs. ''I felt that participating in the program would save us time and money in the long run because of the kind of people who would be helping us grow our company,'' Ms. Chen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUESTIONS TO ASK How much equity do you have to give up to participate? How much investment capital do you receive in return? Who are the mentors you will be working with? How many of the program's graduates have raised money or found a buyer? Can you contact them? Where will you live while participating in the program?</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Sean Glass was ready to return to the United States after living in London to start an online gambling firm that ended up folding. After selling off the company's assets, he wanted to settle in a city with vibrant entrepreneurial and venture capital communities and considered all the usual hubs: Silicon Valley, Boston, New York, Austin, Tex., and Raleigh, N.C. But in July, Mr. Glass, 31, and his wife moved to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a phenomenal pool of engineers, and the quality of life is great,'' Mr. Glass said. Now he is a venture partner at Novak Biddle, a venture capital firm based in Washington, and he recently started Employ Insight, a software company that helps employers with the hiring process.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People like Mr. Glass are harbingers of Washington's second technology incarnation. The first wave was in the mid-1990s, with giants like AOL and Network Solutions choosing the area as their base. Now their younger siblings are setting up shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the way are the big players like LivingSocial, the shopping site that is projected to have revenue of $500 million this year; Clearspring, the Web content-sharing platform; and Opower, an energy efficiency software company that raised $50 million in third-round financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are scrappy up-and-comers, too, as Zvi Band, 26, founder of skeevisArts, a Web design and development firm, and Michael Mayernick, also 26, co-founder of Spinnakr, a Web platform that enables donations, have tried to document.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Band and Mr. Mayernick started proudlymadeindc.com last December to showcase that there is more to the Beltway than lawyers, lobbyists and lawmakers. ''We kept having the conversation with people who would say, 'I didn't know there were so many start-ups in D.C.,' '' Mr. Mayernick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is a snapshot of the blossoming technology scene in a region that includes Washington, Northern Virginia and Maryland. ''Many of these companies didn't exist three or four years ago,'' Mr. Band said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 118 companies featured on the site, up from 40 in December, are HotPads, a map-based real estate search engine, HelloWallet, an independent personal finance Web site, and SB Nation, an online network of sports communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philippe Chetrit, director of Affinity Lab, a shared workspace for entrepreneurs located in the U Street neighborhood of Northwest Washington, says that entrepreneurial momentum in the city is building. Fifty businesses are operating out of Affinity Lab's 4,000 square foot space, twice as many as a year ago, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the Washington area ranks eighth when it comes to venture capital dollars invested, ahead of hubs like Seattle and Denver, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Narrowing it down to venture capital investing in information technology, the area ranks sixth, just behind Boston and the New York metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is this whole new generation of companies that aren't just playing to the typical D.C. niches of government and health care,'' said Tige Savage, who started Revolution, an investment firm based in Washington, along with Donn Davis and Steve Case, co-founder of AOL. ''They might come to D.C. to work for the government or a contractor, but are often eager to start their own companies,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many credit the Obama presidency for making Washington ''cool'' again for the under-30 set. But what else is putting the capital city on the start-up map?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, there is a wellspring of technical expertise -- all those engineers and developers who come to Washington to test missiles and write GPS software for the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Staffing is one the biggest challenges for any company, and being in D.C. has given us an edge in terms of attracting the top people,'' said Tim O'Shaughnessy, co-founder of LivingSocial. ''Being a big fish in a small pond, we've become the destination for people in this area looking to work at a consumer Web site.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the visibility that comes with being a city that has not yet become known as a tech hot spot. In October, Ryan Healy, 26, relocated his start-up, <span class="companylink">Brazen Careerist</span>, a career social networking site for people in their 20s, from Madison, Wis., to McLean, Va. Mr. Healy said the company had won attention from investors and media outlets just for moving to the area. ''That wouldn't happen in other cities,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Barrientos, 45, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Brazen Careerist</span>, has invested $4.5 million in seven companies based in the Washington area since the mid-1990s. He chose the area over others because the competition for investors was not as stiff. ''The value of investing in a place like D.C. is that you can find a company doing extremely cool stuff, but still get a fair valuation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge, Mr. Mayernick said, is that there was not yet that hard-core entrepreneurial culture where it is common to work for equity instead of pay. ''People are so used to steady paychecks in this town,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Washington can sustain its entrepreneurial momentum remains to be seen. Brad Feld, managing director of Foundry Group, the venture capital firm based in Boulder, Colo., sees Washington as three or four years into a new cycle, making it a wobbly toddler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ten years from now will be the test,'' he said. ''It's taken real energy, over time, to create a sustainable entrepreneurial community. Will all these people still be here in a decade?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Bruce Josten, the feisty top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, it got personal last fall on a Sunday talk show when President Obama's spokesman invoked his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They called me out'' during a White House attack on the chamber's midterm campaign efforts, Mr. Josten recalled. Mr. Obama had his own reason to take things personally; his policies were on the receiving end of a $50 million ''voter education'' barrage by the chamber, the signature lobby for American business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, both sides have sheathed their weapons. Mr. Obama will address the chamber on Monday as part of a postelection effort to improve relations with business and, he hopes, accelerate economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Josten sees positive signs. The chamber cheered the bipartisan tax cut compromise that Mr. Obama reached with Republicans in the lame-duck session of Congress, the completion of a United States-South Korea trade deal and the recent appointment of William M. Daley, a former business executive, as White House chief of staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The White House does deserve credit,'' Mr. Josten acknowledged. But he is not yet convinced that such steps will tame what he called the ''regulatory tsunami,'' among other problems, enough to stir the investment and the new hiring the administration seeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's all up in the air,'' Mr. Josten concluded. ''You've got to walk the talk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrowed Differences</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relations between corporate leaders and any Democratic president are necessarily fraught. They have different constituencies and worldviews - on the role of government, the distribution of tax burdens and the proper balance between business and labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Obama's first two years, business saw costly new health care and financial regulations and a president who denounced the ''obscene'' bonuses of Wall Street ''fat cats.'' Mr. Obama's fellow Democrats saw an administration that eschewed bank nationalization and single-payer health care and usually chose cool pragmatism over hot populism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate leaders ''feared truly punishing legislation and behavior, and in fact they never got it,'' said a Democratic strategist, Jim Jordan. They complain loudly anyway, Mr. Jordan added, for the same reason that top basketball coaches like Mike Krzyzewski of Duke yell at referees: to seek advantage on the next close call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new political alignment of 2011 has narrowed their differences. Having achieved his principal goals on health care and financial regulation (while failing on capping carbon emissions), Mr. Obama has moved toward less polarizing priorities. And Republicans' new strength on Capitol Hill requires that any substantive action have bipartisan support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's set aside ideology,'' said Bernadette Budde, senior vice president at the Business Industry Political Action Committee. ''That's not even the arena in which we're going to play for the next two years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Export promotion, infrastructure development and support for innovation through improvements in research and education all represent goals that business shares with an administration hungry to spur investment and job creation. That agenda may also be appealing to political independents, whose impatience for results drove the swing elections of 2006, 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure from those ''fix-it voters,'' Ms. Budde said, helps elevate the component of Mr. Obama's leadership style that values compromise and inclusiveness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think I can work with that Obama,'' she concluded. ''If you're in the room, you're going to get something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wary Partners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of the U.S. Chamber, Thomas J. Donohue, was among the first people Gene Sperling called after Mr. Obama named him last month to head the National Economic Council. Among his goals, Mr. Sperling said, is to be ''an honest broker'' who makes sure ''more people are included'' in policy deliberations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, signals like that have had their intended effect. Corporate leaders ''now feel they have a partner,'' said Johanna Schneider, who directs external relations at the Business Roundtable,, an association of nearly 200 leading chief executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has not wiped away differences of interest or mutual suspicions. ''I have no idea,'' Mr. Josten said, what Mr. Obama will tell the chamber on Monday, but he pointed to several specifics that business would like to hear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those include a commitment to complete additional trade deals with Colombia and Panama; steps toward a fundamental overhaul of the tax code; curbs on politically delicate entitlement programs that are needed to close long-term deficits and new financing sources for Mr. Obama's infrastructure goals. Unlike the chamber, the White House has shied away from supporting a gas tax increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Josten dismissed Mr. Obama's recently announced regulatory strategy, ostensibly intended to reduce unnecessary burdens on business. ''It's a rehash of Clinton's, which was a rehash of Carter's,'' Mr. Josten said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such skepticism underscores the limits of rapprochement between Mr. Obama and business organizations in Washington. Nonetheless, they must cope with one another for at least two more years, and maybe six.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's their field,'' Mr. Josten said of the administration. But ''we're going to be on the field.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following is a text of President Obama's speech given to members of the Chamber of Commerce on Monday, as released by the White House:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you very much. Please, have a seat. Thank you very much, Tom, for the gracious introduction. I want to make a few other acknowledgments. To Tom Bell, the Chamber Board President, thank you for helping to organize this. There are some members of my administration I want to make sure are introduced. My Chief of Staff, Bill Daley, is here. (Applause.) Senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, who is interfacing with many of you and has gotten terrific advice from many of you, is here as well. Secretary Ray LaHood, our Transportation Secretary. Ambassador Ron Kirk, who is working hard to get trade deals around the world. Our Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills. My director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, is here. And I also want to make mention, Fred Hochberg, our Export-Import Bank Chairman; Elizabeth Littlefield, the <span class="companylink">Overseas Private Investment Corporation</span> President. And I also want to acknowledge a good friend, Paul Volcker, the outgoing chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Tom, it is good to be here today at the Chamber of Commerce. I'm here in the interest of being more neighborly. (Laughter.) I strolled over from across the street, and look, maybe if we had brought over a fruitcake when I first moved in, we would have gotten off to a better start. (Laughter.) But I'm going to make up for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is, this isn't the first time I've been to the Chamber, or the first time that we've exchanged ideas. Over the last two years, I've sought advice from many of you as we were grappling with the worst recession most of us have ever known. It's a recession that led to some very difficult decisions. For many of you, that meant restructuring and branch closings and layoffs that I know were very painful to make. For my administration, it meant a series of emergency measures that I would not have undertaken under normal circumstances, but that were necessary to stop our economy from falling off a cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, on some issues, like the Recovery Act, we've found common cause. On other issues, we've had some pretty strong disagreements. But I'm here today because I am convinced, as Tom mentioned in his introduction, that we can and we must work together. Whatever differences we may have, I know that all of us share a deep, abiding belief in this country, a belief in our people, a belief in the principles that have made America's economy the envy of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's success didn't happen overnight, and it didn't happen by accident. It happened because [of] the freedom that has allowed good ideas to flourish, that has allowed capitalism to thrive; it happened because of the conviction that in this country hard work should be rewarded and that opportunity should be there for anybody who's willing to reach for it. And because it happened at every juncture in our history -- not just once, not just twice, but over and over again -- we came together to remake ourselves; we came together as one nation and did what was necessary to win the future. That is why I am so confident that we will win the future again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the challenge that we face today. We still have, by far, the world's largest and most vibrant economy. We have the most productive workers, the finest universities and the freest markets. The men and women in this room are living testimony that American industry is still the source of the most dynamic companies, and the most ingenious entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we also know that with the march of technology over the last few decades, the competition for jobs and businesses has grown fierce. The globalization of our economy means that businesses can now open up a shop, employ workers and produce their goods wherever an Internet connection exists. Tasks that were once done by 1,000 workers can now be done by 100 or in some cases even 10. And the truth is, as countries like China and India and Brazil grow and develop larger middle classes, it's profitable for global companies to aggressively pursue these markets and, at times, to set up facilities in these countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These forces are as unstoppable as they are powerful. But combined with a brutal and devastating recession, these forces have also shaken the faith of the American people -- in the institutions of business and government. They see a widening chasm of wealth and opportunity in this country, and they wonder if the American Dream is slipping away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They wonder if the middle class, rather than expanding as it has through our lifetimes, is in the midst of an inexorable contraction. And we can't ignore these concerns. We have to renew people's faith in the promise of this country - that this is a place where you can make it if you try. And we have to do this together: business and government; workers and CEOs; Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know what it will take for America to win the future. We need to out-innovate, we need to out-educate, we need to out-build our competitors. We need an economy that's based not on what we consume and borrow from other nations, but what we make and what we sell around the world. We need to make America the best place on Earth to do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this is a job for all of us. As a government, we will help lay the foundation for you to grow and innovate and succeed. We will upgrade our transportation and communication networks so you can move goods and information more quickly and more cheaply. We'll invest in education so that you can hire the most skilled, talented workers in the world. And we'll work to knock down barriers that make it harder for you to compete, from the tax code to the regulatory system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I want to be clear: Even as we make America the best place on Earth to do business, businesses also have a responsibility to America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I understand the challenges you face. I understand you are under incredible pressure to cut costs and keep your margins up. I understand the significance of your obligations to your shareholders and the pressures that are created by quarterly reports. I get it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as we work with you to make America a better place to do business, I'm hoping that all of you are thinking what you can do for America. Ask yourselves what you can do to hire more American workers, what you can do to support the American economy and invest in this nation. That's what I want to talk about today - the responsibilities we all have -- the mutual responsibilities we have -- to secure the future that we all share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as a country, we have a responsibility to encourage American innovation. I talked about this quite a bit at my State of the Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies like yours have always driven the discovery of new products and new ideas. You do it better than anybody. But what you also know is that it's not always profitable to -- in the short-term, at least -- for you to invest in basic research. It's very expensive, and the payoffs are not always clear and they're not always localized. And that's why government has traditionally helped invest in this kind of science, planting the seeds that ultimately grew into technologies from the computer chips to the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why we're making investments today in the next generation of big ideas - in biotechnology, in information technology and in clean energy technology. We're reforming our patent system so innovations can move more quickly to market. Steve Case is heading up a new partnership called Startup America to help entrepreneurs turn new ideas into new businesses and new jobs. And I've also proposed a bigger, permanent tax credit for all the research and development your companies do in this country. I believe that is a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also have a responsibility as a nation to provide our people with -- and our businesses -- with the fastest, most reliable way to move goods and information. The costs to business from outdated and inadequate infrastructure is enormous. And that's what we have right now -- outdated, inadequate infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And any of you that have been traveling to other countries, you know it, you see it, and it affects your bottom lines. That's why I want to put more people to work rebuilding crumbling roads, rebuilding our bridges. That's why I've proposed connecting 80 percent of the country with high-speed -- to high-speed rail, and making it possible for companies to put high-speed Internet coverage in the reach of virtually all Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You understand the importance of this. The fact is, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO don't agree on a whole lot. Tom Donohue and Richard Trumka are not <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friends. (Laughter.) Well, maybe -- I don't think you are anyway. (Laughter.) I didn't check on this, but -- but they agree on the need to build a 21st-century infrastructure. And I want to thank the Chamber for pushing Congress to make more infrastructure investments, and to do so in the most cost-effective way possible: with tax dollars that leverage private capital, and with projects that are determined not by politics, but by what's best for our economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third responsibility that we have as a nation is to invest in the skills and education of our young people. If we expect companies to do business and hire in America, America needs a pool of trained, talented workers that can out-compete anybody in the world. And that's why we're reforming K-12 education; that's why we're training 100,000 new math and science teachers; that's why we're making college more affordable, and revitalizing our community college system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently I visited GE in Schenectady, which has partnered with a local community college. And while students train for jobs available at the nearby GE plant, they earn a paycheck and they've got their tuition covered. And as a result, young people can find work, GE can fill high-skill positions, and the entire region has become more attractive to businesses. It's a win-win for everybody, and it's something we're trying to duplicate across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, to make room for these investments in education, in innovation, in infrastructure, government also has a responsibility to cut spending that we just can't afford. That's why I've promised to veto any bill that's larded up with earmarks. That's why I've proposed that we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. Understand what this means. This would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and bring this spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- down to the lowest share of our economy since Eisenhower was president. That was a long time ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it's not going to be enough. We're going to have to do more. Because the driving force on our deficits are entitlements spending. And that's going to require both parties to work together, because those are some tough problems that we're going to have to solve. And I am eager to work with both parties and with the Chamber to take additional steps across the budget to put our nation on a sounder fiscal footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By stopping spending on things we don't need, we can make investments in the things that we do need, the same way families do. If they've got a fiscal problem, if they've got to tighten their belt, they don't stop paying for Johnny to go to college. They cut out things they don't need, but they still make investments in the thing that are going to make sure we win the future. And that's what we have to do as a country: make some smart choices -- tough choices, but smart ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in addition to making government more affordable, we're also making it more effective and more consumer-friendly. We're trying to run the government a little bit more like you run your business -- with better technology and faster services. So in the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. And we want to start with the 12 different agencies that deal with America's exports. If we hope to help our businesses sell more goods around the world, we should ensure we're all pulling in the same direction. And frankly, with 12 different agencies in charge, nobody is in charge. So we're going to fix that as an example of how we can make a government that's more responsive to the American people and to American businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me to the final responsibility of government: breaking down some of the barriers that stand in the way of your success. As far as exports are concerned, that means seeking new opportunities and opening new markets for your goods. And I will tell you I will go anywhere anytime to be a booster for American businesses, American workers and American products. We recently signed -- (applause) -- and I don't charge a commission. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We recently signed export deals with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States. We finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. And by the way, it's a deal that has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans. That's the kind of deal that I will be looking for as we pursue trade agreements with Panama and Colombia, as we work to bring Russia into the international trading system. Those are going to be our top priorities because we believe Americans have the best products and the best businesses, and if we're out there selling and we're out there hustling, there's no reason why we can't do a lot better than we're doing right now when it comes to our exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, another barrier government can remove -- and I hear a lot about this from many of you -- is a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest rates in the world. You know how it goes: because of various loopholes and carve-outs that have built up over the years, some industries pay an average rate that is four or five times higher than others. Companies are taxed heavily for making investments with equity, yet the tax code actually pays companies to invest using leverage. As a result, you've got too many companies ending up making decisions based on what their tax director says instead of what their engineer designs or what their factories produce. And that puts our entire economy at a disadvantage. We need something smarter, something simpler, something fairer. That's why I want to lower the corporate rate and eliminate these loopholes to pay for it, so that it doesn't add a dime to our deficit. And I'm asking for your help in this fight. I think it can be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me to the last barriers we're trying to remove, and those are outdated and unnecessary regulations. I've ordered a government-wide review, and if there are rules on the books that are needlessly stifling job creation and economic growth, we will fix them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already we're dramatically cutting down on the paperwork that saddles businesses with huge administrative costs. We're improving the way FDA evaluates things like medical devices, to get innovative and lifesaving treatments to market faster. And the EPA, based on the need for further scientific analysis, delayed the greenhouse gas permitting rules for biomass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've also ordered agencies to find ways to make regulations more flexible for small businesses. And we've turned a tangle of fuel economy regulations and pending lawsuits into a single standard that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, save consumers money at the pump and give car companies the certainty that they need -- all negotiated by the various stakeholders without the need for congressional legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ultimately, winning the future is not just about what the government can do for you to succeed. It's also about what you can do to help America succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we were just talking about regulations. Even as we eliminate burdensome regulations, America's businesses have a responsibility as well to recognize that there are some basic safeguards, some basic standards that are necessary to protect the American people from harm or exploitation. Not every regulation is bad. Not every regulation is burdensome on business. A lot of the regulations that are out there are things that all of us welcome in our lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few of us would want to live in a society without rules that keep our air and water clean; that give consumers the confidence to do everything from investing in financial markets to buying groceries. And the fact is, when standards like these have been proposed in the past, opponents have often warned that they would be an assault on business and free enterprise. We can look at the history in this country. Early drug companies argued the bill creating the FDA would ''practically destroy the sale of remedies in the United States.'' That didn't happen. Auto executives predicted that having to install seatbelts would bring the downfall of their industry. It didn't happen. The President of the American Bar Association denounced child labor laws as ''a communistic effort to nationalize children.'' That's a quote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these things came to pass. In fact, companies adapt and standards often spark competition and innovation. I was travelling when I went up to Penn State to look at some clean energy hubs that have been set up. I was with Steve Chu, my Secretary of Energy. And he won a Nobel Prize in physics, so when you're in conversations with him you catch about one out of every four things he says. (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he started talking about energy efficiency and about refrigerators, and he pointed out that the government set modest targets a couple decades ago to start increasing efficiency over time. They were well thought through; they weren't radical. Companies competed to hit these markers. And they hit them every time, and then exceeded them. And as a result, a typical fridge now costs half as much and uses a quarter of the energy that it once did -- and you don't have to defrost, chipping at that stuff -- (laughter) -- and then putting the warm water inside the freezer and all that stuff. It saves families and businesses billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So regulations didn't destroy the industry; it enhanced it and it made our lives better -- if they're smart, if they're well designed. And that's our goal, is to work with you to think through how do we design necessary regulations in a smart way and get rid of regulations that have outlived their usefulness, or don't work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also have to point out the perils of too much regulation are also matched by the dangers of too little. And we saw that in the financial crisis, where the absence of sound rules of the road, that wasn't good for business. Even if you weren't in the financial sector it wasn't good for business. And that's why, with the help of Paul Volcker, who is here today, we passed a set of common-sense reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same can be said of health insurance reform. We simply could not continue to accept a status quo that's made our entire economy less competitive, as we've paid more per person for health care than any other nation on Earth. Nobody is even close. And we couldn't accept a broken system where insurance companies could drop people because they got sick, or families went into bankruptcy because of medical bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know that folks here have concerns about this law. And I understand it. If you're running a business right now and you're seeing these escalating health care costs, your instinct is if I've got even more laws on top of me, that's going to increase my costs even more. I understand that suspicion, that skepticism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the non-partisan congressional watchdogs at the CBO estimate that health care tax credits will be worth nearly $40 billion for small businesses over the next decade -- $40 billion, directly to small businesses who are doing the right thing by their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And experts - not just from the government, but also those commissioned by the Business Roundtable - suggest that health insurance reform could ultimately save large employers anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 per family -- your employees and your bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've said in the State of the Union and I'll repeat here today: I am willing and happy to look at other ideas to improve the law, including incentives to improve patient safety and medical malpractice reforms. And I want to correct a flaw that's already placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on too many small businesses, and I appreciate the Chamber's help in doing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we have to recognize that some common-sense regulations often will make sense for your businesses, as well as your families, as well as your neighbors, as well as your coworkers. Of course, your responsibility goes beyond recognizing the need for certain standards and safeguards. If we're fighting to reform the tax code and increase exports to help you compete, the benefits can't just translate into greater profits and bonuses for those at the top. They have to be shared by American workers, who need to know that expanding trade and opening markets will lift their standards of living as well as your bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can't go back to the kind of economy and culture that we saw in the years leading up to the recession, where growth and gains in productivity just didn't translate into rising incomes and opportunity for the middle class. That's not something necessarily we can legislate, but it's something that all of us have to take responsibility for thinking about. How do we make sure that everybody's got a stake in trade, everybody's got a stake in increasing exports, everybody's got a stake in rising productivity? Because ordinary folks end up seeing their standards of living rise as well. That's always been the American promise. That's what JFK meant when he said, ''A rising tide lifts all boats.'' Too many boats have been left behind, stuck in the mud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if we as a nation are going to invest in innovation, that innovation should lead to new jobs and manufacturing on our shores. The end result of tax breaks and investments can't simply be that new breakthroughs and technologies are discovered here in America, but then the manufacturing takes place overseas. That, too, breaks the social compact. It makes people feel as if the game is fixed and they're not benefiting from the extraordinary discoveries that take place here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the key to our success has never been just developing new ideas; it's also been making new products. So Intel pioneers the microchip, then puts thousands to work building them in Silicon Valley. Henry Ford perfects the assembly line, and then puts a generation to work in the factories of Detroit. That's how we built the largest middle class in the world. Those folks working in those plants, they go out and they buy a Ford. They buy a personal computer. And the economy grows for everyone. And that's how we'll create the base of knowledge and skills that propel the next inventions and the next ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, businesses across this country are proving that America can compete. Caterpillar is opening a new plant to build excavators in Texas that used to be shipped from Japan. In Tennessee, Whirlpool is opening their first new U.S. factory in more than a decade. Dow is building a new plant in Michigan to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. A company called Geomagic, a software maker, decided to close down its overseas centers in China and Europe and move their R&amp;D here to the United States. These companies are bringing jobs back to our shores. And that's good for everybody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if I've got one message, my message is now is the time to invest in America. Now is the time to invest in America. (Applause.) Today, American companies have nearly $2 trillion sitting on their balance sheets. And I know that many of you have told me that you're waiting for demand to rise before you get off the sidelines and expand, and that with millions of Americans out of work, demand has risen more slowly than any of us would like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're in this together, but many of your own economists and salespeople are now forecasting a healthy increase in demand. So I just want to encourage you to get in the game. As part of the bipartisan tax deal we negotiated, with the support of the Chamber, businesses can immediately expense 100 percent of their capital investments. And as all of you know, it's investments made now that will pay off as the economy rebounds. And as you hire, you know that more Americans working will mean more sales for your companies. It will mean more demand for your products and services. It will mean higher profits for your companies. We can create a virtuous circle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if there's a reason you don't share my confidence, if there's a reason you don't believe that this is the time to get off the sidelines - to hire and to invest - I want to know about it. I want to fix it. That's why I've asked Jeff Immelt of GE to lead a new council of business leaders and outside experts so that we're getting the best advice on what you're facing out there - and we'll be holding our first meeting two weeks from now, on the 24th. So you can get your emails in early, with your ideas, with your thoughts about how we keep moving forward to create this virtuous cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, I am confident we can win the competition for new jobs and industries. And I know you share my enthusiasm. Here's one thing I know. For all the disagreements, Tom, that we may have sometimes on issues, I know you love this country. I know you want America to succeed just as badly as I do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, yes, we'll have some disagreements; and, yes, we'll see things differently at times. But we're all Americans. And that spirit of patriotism, and that sense of mutual regard and common obligation, that has carried us through far harder times than the ones we've just been through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I'm reminded, toward the end of the 1930s, amidst the Depression, the looming prospect of war, FDR, President Roosevelt, realized he would need to form a new partnership with business if we were going to become what he would later call the ''arsenal of democracy.'' And as you can imagine, the relationship between the President and business leaders during the course of the Depression had been rocky at times. They'd grown somewhat fractured by the New Deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Roosevelt reached out to businesses, and business leaders answered the call to serve their country. After years of working at cross purposes, the result was one of the most productive collaborations between the public and private sectors in American history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some, like the head of GM, hadn't previously known the President, and if anything had seen him as an adversary. But he gathered his family and he explained that he was going to head up what would become the War Production Board. And he said to his family, ''This country has been good to me, and I want to pay it back.'' I want to pay it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the years that followed, automobile factories converted to making planes and tanks. And corset factories made grenade belts. A toy company made compasses. A pinball machine maker turned out shells. 1941 would see the greatest expansion of manufacturing in the history of America. And not only did this help us win the war; it led to millions of new jobs and helped produce the great American middle class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we have faced hard times before. We have faced moments of tumult and moments of change. And we know what to do. We know how to succeed. We are Americans, and as we have done throughout our history, I have every confidence that once again we will rise to this occasion; that we can come together, we can adapt and we can thrive in this changing economy. And we need to look no further than the innovative companies in this room. If we can harness your potential and the potential of your people across this country, I think there's no stopping us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until summer 2009, Ami Kassar was a nine-to-fiver, working for Advanta, one of the largest providers of credit cards to small business. But then the company went bust, another victim of the credit crisis, and the newly unemployed Mr. Kassar decided to strike out on his own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He formed MultiFunding, a broker that helps arrange loans for small businesses. It was hardly an auspicious time to open any business, but Mr. Kassar's challenge was particularly daunting: the freeze in small commercial loans was only beginning to thaw. Plus, business loan brokering has been a fairly obscure and even somewhat shadowy field -- but one that Mr. Kassar says he believes serves a growing need.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running both a start-up and a loan broker, Mr. Kassar has had an unusual perspective on the small-business credit crisis. Based near Philadelphia, MultiFunding, which observed its first anniversary last week, now employs four people full time and has completed 12 transactions. It is presently helping 120 clients in 23 states secure financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kassar, who works with companies that seek at least $250,000, said that he was able to help from one-third to one-half of his prospective clients. When MultiFunding procures financing, it takes as a fee either a percentage of the financed loan -- from 1 to 2.5 percent -- or, in the case of a refinancing, two months' worth of saving over the original debt service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kassar recently spoke about his business and the market for small-business lending. This is a condensed version of that conversation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What accounts for MultiFunding's growth -- marketing, or a worsening economic environment for businesses?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think there's a yearning and crying out for transparency and knowledge and understanding. Most small-business owners are more tradesmen than they are businessmen, and they don't really understand the finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What don't they understand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think people have a hard time with the whole collateral concept. Also, when you get into a loan, it's extremely important to know what it's going to take to get out of it if you choose to get out of it early. A few weeks ago, we were refinancing a loan and the prepayment penalty the bank was trying to charge the client was 19.5 percent of the face value of the loan. The guy didn't even realize he had a prepayment penalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I would guess that 15 years ago not many small businesses went to intermediaries to help them find loans. Why do businesses come to you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Banks push the products or services that they have to offer. In today's world, a bank's portfolio of options represent maybe five or 10 of the options available to the customer. And in all the confusion out there with all these different structures and options, I think it's very difficult for the average small-business owner to figure out what is going on. We have lending products in our portfolio that are as low as 4 percent annual interest to as high as 60 percent annual interest. The goal is to get them the cheapest possible loan that we think we can get them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Is a 60 percent loan ever good for a business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I am not a fan of 60 percent loans, but if you need money to fulfill a purchase order or buy some inventory, and you have no other collateral to work with. ... Sixty percent a year is 5 percent a month, and if you borrow that money for two months at 10 percent and you make 30 percent on it, you're still better off than you were without it. I would rather that they be aware of the choice and then they can make the decision for themselves. I don't always agree with the decisions my clients make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we try to bring some innovative and creative thinking. There's a client who is currently backed up on payroll taxes with the I.R.S. and their business has dropped by about a half this year, but they have plenty of collateral. We are putting them into a factoring arrangement so he can pay off the I.R.S. quickly, and then flip him into an S.B.A. loan where he can pay off the other debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Are there people who should get loans that you can't get bank loans for at this point?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think the people who aren't getting loans today are appropriately not getting loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What disqualifies people right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Collateral. The value of their houses has collapsed, or the value of their equipment or commercial properties has collapsed. This most likely disqualifies people from S.B.A. loans or traditional commercial mortgages and drags them into factoring or asset-based lending or private money. That's about half of our fundable clients. No one is addressing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What could be done?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think there is an interesting idea for some kind of collateral exchange, if there was an eager entrepreneur out there. Companies could get someone to put up collateral for a loan in exchange for something. The investor doesn't have to put up hard cash. He's basically putting up the insurance policy for the company, if it all goes south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. It sounds like derivatives trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In some ways, maybe. The other thing I have suggested on my blog is that perhaps you could borrow money against your future revenues, or your future income. I now have one lender I work with who lends between $100,000 and $200,000 to a small business with a six- to 24-month payback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Did you make that connection as a result of your blog post?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I did, yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Are there particular banks that you like to try first?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We hate going to the bigger banks. As a general rule, we would much rather go to a smaller community bank. For S.B.A. loans, there are a number of lenders based out of a small community bank doing S.B.A. loans on a national footprint. We like to go to those guys. If you are living in Paducah, Ky., and you go to an S.B.A. lender in your community, and they've done two S.B.A. loans that year, you're marching up the wrong street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Is your first choice to put someone in an S.B.A. loan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No. If their credit is in the high fives to mid-sixes, or their collateral is a hodgepodge of things, then it's appropriate to put them in an S.B.A. loan. If they have decent collateral and the high sixes or the low sevens on a credit score and decent cash flow, I'd rather keep them away from the S.B.A. loan. There are a lot of regs, and there are a lot of rules and there are nine million papers to fill out. We joke that you have to give blood for these loans. The fastest S.B.A. loan I have ever gotten done is in 11 weeks, from start to finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.When you find that the credit scores are good enough to avoid the S.B.A., which banks do you go to?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We try to go to community banks or medium-sized banks in the community where that customer is, and generally speaking, from start to finish those loans are about four to six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The big banks -- Chase, Citi, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> -- have all been talking about their commitment to small-business lending. How well have their actions measured up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Our customers have been through the wringer with them for months. They do press releases about how they're hiring all these small-business bankers. I'd like to see less talk and more walk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Have you tried to get a loan for your business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you want one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No. If I tried, I don't think I would be eligible.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who run a business alone often want it to appear bigger than it really is -- as if it has teams of employees and unlimited resources. This is now more possible than ever thanks to some tools that so-called solopreneurs and other small businesses have at their disposal, giving them the reach and capabilities of far bigger companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Logan Hale, founder of YourLittleFilm, which is based in suburban Los Angeles and creates custom short films, was a sponsor of the children's dance tour Baby Loves Disco, staffing a booth at a series of Southern California events. The promotion was so successful that he wound up with 400 leads -- and a problem. ''I don't have time for that kind of follow-up,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Hale used Batchbook, customer relationship management software for small business. Although he had to enter the leads, Batchbook integrated with MailChimp, a Web-based e-mail marketing platform that automatically generated and sent a follow-up e-mail to every lead. Batchbook then kept track of the responses. ''I had a 10 percent response rate, which is great for e-mail,'' said Mr. Hale. ''From those, I've already had six jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although technology like that can be a game-changer, David S. Garland, a business owner who is author of ''Smarter, Faster, Cheaper'' (Wiley, 2010), cautions it can also become overwhelming. Tools, he said, should be ''simple, functional and really help the business.'' Here are some of the tools and strategies he, Mr. Hale and others use to emulate -- and compete against -- much bigger companies:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCHEDULING Mr. Garland leans heavily on Tungle.me, a free calendar-management tool. It lets him create a calendar page that syncs with his calendar program and shows clients open times in his schedule without revealing information about other appointments. Once a meeting date and time are approved, the appointment appears on both parties' calendars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonia Gallagher, a lawyer who runs her own business-development consulting firm, Time For Life, uses TimeTrade, an appointment-scheduling software that also helps with marketing. It invites prospective clients to schedule consultations, conferences or meetings with her. ''It attaches to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> Outlook or <span class="companylink">Google</span> Calendar to show them your available times, '' Ms. Gallagher said. ''It's like a personal scheduling assistant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Xavier, an executive coach, uses <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s Exchange e-mail system -- a staple among Fortune 500 companies -- through Intermedia, a hosted Exchange server, for about $50 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Exchange, Mr. Xavier, whose business is Cornerstone Executive Development Group in Chapel Hill, N.C., links the calendars, address books and e-mail programs on his computers, BlackBerry and iPad. A change made on a calendar on any one device syncs instantly with all of the others, Mr. Xavier said. Because his large clients use Exchange, he says he believes that his using it as well ''gives them the impression that I am bigger than I am.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Google</span> Voice phone number can be especially useful because it automatically transcribes voice mail into e-mail -- creating a written, searchable record of messages. Matthew Taylor Ruggieri, owner of the Motley, a Web site based in Los Angeles that sells men's grooming products, said <span class="companylink">Google</span> Voice made him more efficient. ''It lets me respond to a customer's request wherever I am by voice, text or e-mail,'' he said. ''And if things get too crazy, I can route the calls to my sister's phone and she helps me out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E-MAIL AND SOCIAL MEDIA MailChimp, which Mr. Hale used to follow up with those Baby Loves Disco leads, also helps him send monthly newsletters to his clients -- with the option of creating a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or Twitter link version of the newsletter. MailChimp can send auto-respond e-mails as well, which Mr. Ruggieri uses to follow up after a customer makes a purchase. ''A personal-looking e-mail response is triggered 10 days later asking if the product was satisfactory,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he did after the Baby Loves Disco tour, Mr. Hale puts all of his client leads and contacts into Batchbook. ''I can pull up my contacts and find all my client's information, including social media data -- like their last three tweets,'' he said. ''This gives me something relevant to talk about in making contact with them.'' It also pings him when a client's child has a birthday coming up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORGANIZATION Peter Sorgenfrei, founder of a product development consulting firm, Sorgenfrei L.L.C in New York, uses a Web application called Highrise to keep track of his e-mail, so he knows when he last communicated with a client and what was said. Whenever Mr. Sorgenfrei sends an e-mail, a blind copy of the message is sent to his Highrise account, where it is archived. ''I come across as completely buttoned-up and in-control,'' he said, ''because I have all the information, files and discussions in one place and can access them before talking to the client.'' Recently, when an automotive manufacturer he works with couldn't find some legal documents it had sent him, Mr. Sorgenfrei located them in his Highrise archive. It took him just minutes to send the documents back to the client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hale relies on OmniFocus, a Web-based task management program with an iPhone app that allows him to capture his thoughts and turn them into actionable items. ''Whether it's that I need to buy milk, call a client, write my e-mail newsletter,'' he said, ''it gets it out of my head and prioritized, so I know when I'll do each thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garland solves his clutter problem -- the piles of papers and receipts -- with Shoeboxed. ''They send you a prepaid envelope and you shove everything in there,'' he said. ''They digitize it and create a content management system for you, then send back the originals.'' Shoeboxed has an iPhone app for scanning business cards and receipts; if users send photos of those cards and receipts, Shoeboxed will extract the expense and contact data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ACCOUNTING Several business owners recommended FreshBooks, a cloud-based accounting software that is free (up to a point that suits most solo business operators). FreshBooks' MiniBooks app for the iPhone allows business owners to record their time on the way home from a client or send an invoice when traveling. It also integrates with Shoeboxed so that digitalized expense receipts can be turned into an invoice. ''It's very easy to use and lets you send out professional-looking invoices instantly, which is very important,'' Mr. Garland said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OFFLINE TOOLS AND STRATEGIES Many solo entrepreneurs rely on virtual assistants -- temporary help hired as needed -- who work remotely, usually from their homes. They can handle tasks like research, data entry and e-mail replies. Mr. Garland uses virtual assistants about 40 hours a month. ''What's nice is you don't have an employee,'' he said. ''This is someone who bills you by the hour, so it's an expense you can deduct.'' Mr. Sorgenfrei has a membership in Regus, which enables him to find temporary office space worldwide. ''I can show up at any Regus location and work there for the day, get a land line, Internet access and schedule a conference room if I have a meeting,'' he said. ''As a solopreneur it's easy to get caught up in a coffee shop thinking big thoughts instead of actually getting work done.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The House voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to repeal burdensome tax-reporting requirements that were imposed on small businesses to help pay for the expansion of health insurance coverage under the new health care law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no immediate relief for small business is in sight because the House and the Senate disagree on how to pay for the expected loss of revenue, more than $20 billion over 10 years. The White House, while supporting repeal, has not recommended a way to offset the cost.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote on the House bill was 314 to 112, with 76 Democrats joining 238 Republicans in support of the measure. All of the no votes were cast by Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers said the goal of repealing the paperwork mandate had nearly universal support in Congress. The Senate approved a similar change last month, financed in an entirely different way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadlock shows the difficulty of making even small changes in the health care law, one of President Obama's proudest achievements, which was passed last year without any Republican votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Cathcart, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business, said the uncertainty was frustrating to small businesses. ''Only in Washington can you have something so universally agreed to, and yet we still cannot get it done,'' Ms. Cathcart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the law, businesses must file reports with the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099 identifying most providers of goods or services to whom they pay $600 or more in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax experts said the reports would improve compliance by encouraging vendors of goods and services to pay more of the tax they owe, just as individuals are more likely to pay tax on dividends and interest if they know that such income has been reported to the I.R.S. by banks and mutual funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small businesses said the law would impose a huge administrative burden, requiring them to hire accountants and buy computer software to report routine purchases of office equipment, food, gasoline, lumber and thousands of other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, said: ''The 1099 reporting requirement is an administrative nightmare for employers. It has the potential to devastate small businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new health care law requires most Americans to carry health insurance, starting in 2014. People with modest incomes will be eligible for subsidies, or tax credits, to help them afford the premiums. The amount of the subsidy is based on a person's income, estimated from tax returns for prior years. People may be required to repay some or all of the tax credit if their actual incomes prove to be higher than estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House bill increases the amount that people may have to repay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats denounced this as a tax increase on the middle class and said that honest taxpayers might find themselves owing large sums to the I.R.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ''Paying back money that you were not entitled to is not a tax increase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, said, ''If you get a subsidy you don't deserve, you will have to pay it back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, said: ''We all believe the 1099 reporting requirement needs to be repealed. We, too, want to help small business, but not on the backs of middle-class taxpayers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To illustrate how the Republican bill would work, Mr. Crowley gave this example: A family of four with an annual income of $88,000 buys a typical family insurance policy costing $13,000. The family would have to pay $8,360 in premiums and could qualify for a federal tax credit of $4,640, which the Treasury would pay directly to the insurance company. If the breadwinner receives a $250 bonus at work, the family would become ineligible for the tax credit and would have to repay the full amount, $4,640, with its income taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, described the repayment obligation as ''a Republican tax trap.'' Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said it was ''a tax on success'' that would penalize people whose incomes had increased because of a raise, a bonus or additional hours of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate voted in February to repeal the reporting requirement. It would give the White House Office of Management and Budget broad discretion to offset the cost by refusing to spend money already appropriated by Congress.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- For Naval Ravikant, the problem with investing in start-ups boils down to coffee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got really tired of coffee meetings,'' said Mr. Ravikant, 37, a technology entrepreneur turned investor. So burned out, in fact, that he bought the Web address idontdocoffee.com. When start-up companies looking for financing request in-person meetings, they get a reply from the e-mail address naval@idontdocoffee.com.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought, we're dealing with Internet start-ups here, there has got to be a better, more efficient way to evaluate them than to do thousands of coffee meetings,'' Mr. Ravikant said. ''Coffee should be the last step, not the first.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in February 2009, Mr. Ravikant and Babak Nivi, a fellow investor and start-up mentor, started AngelList, a networking Web site that substitutes endless pitch meetings with Internet-based matchmaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AngelList, akin to online dating sites, allows eager start-up companies to pair up with investors looking to buy into the next Twitter or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. More than 1,300 investors have already joined the site, including about 400 venture capitalists. The rest are angel investors, the name given to those who buy a stake of a company with their own money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, more than 20 start-ups from all over the world join the site every day, and about 200 companies have been financed. Mr. Ravikant and Mr. Nivi vet the investors before they are allowed on the site, which is free to join for both investors and start-ups and has become hotter in Silicon Valley than many popular start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site combines deal-making with social network profiles to make it ''one of the most innovative things that has happened in venture capital in the last five years,'' said Dave McClure, an angel investor and founding partner of 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley technology incubator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McClure is one of the most active investors on AngelList's site, writing checks for up to $250,000 to dozens of start-up companies, including $100,000 recently to forrst.com, an online community for Web designers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone shares Mr. McClure's enthusiasm. Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have voiced concern that AngelList adds more fuel to an already overheated start-up market. Among the site's detractors is Bryce Roberts, co-founder of O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures and an investor in Foursquare. He recently wrote a blog post detailing why he had deleted his AngelList account, saying the site created an environment where ''angels feel compelled to invest for fear of missing the boat everyone else is getting on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His post started an online skirmish among prominent angel investors, venture capitalists and bloggers. ''AngelList does allow people who are not knowledgeable to jump into deals they perceive to be hot because certain influential investors are involved,'' said Mr. McClure. ''But that's no different than any other trading environment. If Warren Buffett invests in a stock, it moves the stock. Is that a reason not to use the stock exchange?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for start-ups is clearly heating up. In 2010, venture investments grew for the first time since 2007. Investment in early stage companies grew 15 percent from the year before, the first growth since 2007, according to the National Venture Capital Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in a golden age of start-up innovation because the cost of starting a company has crashed through the floor,'' said Mitch Kapor, the founder of <span class="companylink">Lotus Development</span> and a longtime angel investor. ''There is a huge flood of new companies; so many you can't possibly find all of them on your own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kapor recently invested $50,000 to $200,000 in several companies he had found on AngelList, including fundly.com, an online fund-raising platform that raised $2 million through AngelList.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Ravikant, he sees AngelList enabling start-ups from a wider geographic range to find the capital needed to build their companies. It is expensive for a start-up in Chile or Estonia, for example, to get coffee with an angel investor in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If some small start-ups fail along the way, and many undoubtedly will, that is no reason for concern, Mr. Ravikant said. ''What is the harm if a bunch of rich, old people are writing checks to a bunch of young kids to go build start-ups and pursue their dreams and maybe create the next Twitter?'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Worst-case scenario, it is a very efficient wealth-transfer scheme,'' he said. ''Best case, it is the engine that is going to fuel small-business job creation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ravikant has been on both the investor and the start-up side, and his allegiances are unquestionably with the start-ups. After growing up with little money in Delhi, India, and then New York, Mr. Ravikant started learning computer programming languages as a teacher's assistant at Dartmouth, where he also delivered newspapers and washed dishes in the cafeteria to pay his way through college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm always rooting for the small guy,'' he said. ''Call it a Napoleon complex, call it the underdog, call it growing up as a poor, fat, immigrant kid. I never like to see the entrenched powers win.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After moving to Silicon Valley, Mr. Ravikant helped create a handful of companies including epinions.com, a product review site, and vast.com, a classifieds site. He also invested in companies like Twitter, Foursquare and Jambool, a payment system for mobile applications that <span class="companylink">Google</span> bought last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AngelList now operates out of a one-room office in a multistory building full of one-room technology start-ups in South of Market, a popular neighborhood for technology businesses in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, AngelList witnessed its biggest investor frenzy yet, over a company called Green Goose, which bills itself as a ''real-world game platform.'' Green Goose makes tiny motion-sensing stickers that attach to everyday objects like running shoes or pill bottles. The sensors upload real-time data when an object is used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two angel investors committed $100,000 to Green Goose's founder, Brian Krejcarek, after listening to him describe his product on stage at a start-up conference in San Francisco. ''AngelList went nuts,'' Mr. Krejcarek said. ''I got a hundred-some e-mails from interested angel investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within days, Mr.Krejcarek had hand-picked about a dozen investors and raised $500,000. ''I've been eating ramen noodles for the last two years,'' said Mr.Krejcarek, who moved to Silicon Valley last week after completing the investment round. ''I'd been pounding on doors over and over again without too many people listening, so the sheer volume of really qualified, interesting angel investors reaching out to me was overwhelming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ravikant says that is not an unfamiliar story but the happy ending still does not include coffee. ''We have a collection of liquor bottles in our office because companies stop by all the time and say, 'Thank you, you got our financing done,' '' he said. ''They don't know how to thank us so they pay us in liquor, cookies and cupcakes.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUSTIN, Tex. -- For most entrepreneurs, running a Web site that is rife with pornography and frequently criticized as a menace to society would not be considered a resume booster. Many venture capitalists would head in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Christopher Poole, the 23-year-old founder of 4chan, one of the largest forums on the Internet and widely considered to be one of the darkest corners of the Web, has never shied away from his first creation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, he has deftly managed to transform the notorious popularity of 4chan, which he said has a staggering 12 million visitors a month, into a launching pad for his successful career as a public speaker, an adviser at the investment fund Lerer Ventures and as the founder of the new Web site Canvas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has received financing from such respected venture capitalists as Ron Conway, a noted Silicon Valley investor who was one of the earliest investors in <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Kenneth Lerer, a founder of The Huffington Post, and Joshua Schachter, who created Delicious, the popular social bookmarking service that <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> bought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm formed by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, also invested. Mr. Horowitz said Canvas was ''one of the easier investment decisions we've ever made.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canvas was officially unveiled on Sunday at South by Southwest, the technology and music festival held annually in Austin. The Web site allows people to upload images and watch as other members on the site add to and remix the content.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's pure entertainment on the Internet,'' Mr. Poole said. ''I don't think the idea that people just hang out online has really caught on, but that is a thing. It is an actual hobby for a lot of people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now the site is limited to images, but eventually, Mr. Poole wants to add video and audio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one level, the flow of ideas, or memes in Web parlance, across the site resembles 4chan. A recent popular thread on Canvas featured a cute tiny brown dog covered with snow. Each subsequent image added to the original.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One introduced characters from ''Star Wars'' to the photo, then someone joked about calling in Charlie Sheen to help the dog clear away the snow, a thinly veiled reference to Mr. Sheen's widely publicized struggles with drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poole likens the spontaneous interplay of these interactions to watching a particularly funny improvised comedy skit unfold or the feverish excitement of attending the opening night of a movie with a cult following in the company of hundreds of other dedicated fans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a shared experience, knowing that you and several other people are experiencing this and participating in helping something unfold in this moment,'' he said. ''That ephemeral nature of that moment is special and will never be repeated in the same way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is something 4chan is really good at,'' he added. ''The site is just a framework of pictures and text. There aren't any rules. But an entire culture, complete with its own vocabulary and language, sprang up around it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June Cohen, executive producer of TED media, said, ''Like it or hate it, 4chan is an important cultural force.'' TED is the prestigious conference held annually in Long Beach, Calif., where Mr. Poole was invited to speak in 2010. ''It is a huge site, and so many Internet memes are formed there, it's hard to ignore it,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canvas is somewhat similar to 4chan. Members of the online community do not have to use their real identities to participate, which flies in the face of the Quoras, Facebooks and Twitters of the Web, which bank their business models and reputations on knowing who each user is and establishing a fixed identity on the Web.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Poole says he hopes Canvas will create a unique social culture online, and he is quick to add that Canvas is not intended to replicate 4chan. ''We're not building 4chan 2.0,'' he said, thumping his hoodie-cloaked chest for emphasis. ''Canvas is a separate endeavor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the challenge now for Mr. Poole is to keep Canvas and 4chan as separate entities, to keep the lack of identification from devolving into bad behavior and from cross-pollinating the mischief and mayhem that permeate his first venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems to be working. During the first few weeks while the site has been in private testing, the company has only had to remove a handful of the offensive images from Canvas that are common on 4chan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poole created 4chan in 2003 on summer break at 15. He modeled it after a Japanese anime site called 2chan. For the next several years, most people knew Mr. Poole only by his online handle, moot. He came out publicly as the founder of 4chan a few years ago. Before then, he ran the site in secrecy from his bedroom. Even his parents were unaware of the site. ''Even in my real life, I was anonymous,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During that time, the site exploded in popularity and cemented itself squarely in Internet culture, for better or worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheer power and influence that 4chan is able to wield online is difficult to deny and often goes beyond the Internet. The site is credited with creating one of the better-known Internet memes, Lolcats, pictures of cute cats paired with quirky, misspelled captions. In 2009, 4channers concentrated their efforts on electing Mr. Poole as Time magazine'smost influential person of the year, earning him a ticket to a red carpet event that included John Legend and Diane Sawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the site is often at the root of much mayhem on the Internet. Members taunted the family of a teenage suicide victim. A few years ago, members on the site started a rumor that Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, had suffered a heart attack, causing shares of the company to plummet. More recently, some 4channers initiated a Web attack that brought down <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, Visa and Mastercard, after those sites cut off donations to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the drawing power of Canvas intrigued venture capitalists who provided $625,000 in seed money. The investors say this is a new kind of service that may portend a different future for Web services and behaviors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our investment is in Chris,'' Mr. Horowitz said. ''No other site has started as many new ideas that have caught fire on the Internet as 4chan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't know what it's going to become,'' Mr. Horowitz said of Canvas. ''But, if he can foster than in a better environment, we are willing to wait and see what happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all that traffic on 4chan, the site itself makes little money. Few companies, outside of the adult services industry, are interested in running advertisements on the site. Mr. Poole says the site generates ''in the low five figures,'' enough to cover the costs for the servers and bandwidth needed to operate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two years ago we used to joke about getting investors for 4chan,'' he said. ''And now here we are with Canvas. But we really think there is a kernel of something great here.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the rocketing valuations of social media companies, there is again hope that our economy can compete globally. The hope belies a sobering reality. Governments cannot create or even know what will be the next great entrepreneurial success. The Web's latest hits show the pitfalls of such efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Groupon and Twitter are successes backed by venture capital at an early stage.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies had a timely idea, but entrepreneurial efforts and vision may have carried them to fortune. It was not just the founders, but advisers, employees and other companies that helped stir this creative spirit. Investors and advisers like lawyers exist side by side with gaggles of venture capital-financed companies and their most important resource: talented, innovative employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These networks have been a crucial driving force for venture capital. There are few successful venture capital communities in the United States. Silicon Valley is the one everyone knows, but Austin, Tex., and Boston are also prominent. Other emerging venture capital communities are in Boulder, Colo.; Chicago; and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all of these are organically created communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What causes their creation is debated. Some theorists will say that military spending in the Silicon Valley area combined with two large research institutions and corporate spinoff technology from companies like Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center created a critical mass that spurred formation of the venture capital funds and lured the people who innovate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Senor and Saul Singer recently wrote ''Start-Up Nation,'' a book about Israel, the only country that has created a venture capital network to rival Silicon Valley. They attribute Israel's success to its military and the requirement that all citizens serve a period of service. The maturity and entrepreneurial nature of the military combined with an influx of Russian emigres created Israel's venture capital network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book may be right, but the authors do not explain a Mark Zuckerberg, who, like most of Silicon Valley's celebrities, never served in the military.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is, there is no consensus on how to create this community. This is a problem because many are trying and few are succeeding. France, Norway and Malaysia have all failed despite fervent efforts. In the United States, California still dominates. Thirty-five companies on The Wall Street Journal's 2011 list of the top 50 venture capital-backed investments are based in California. Mr. Zuckerberg started in Boston but went west to Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These private efforts are distinct from recent federal government initiatives. The 2007 stimulus bill provided $6 billion in loan guarantees for renewable electricity ventures. While the average private venture capital investment last year was about $4 million, according to the National Venture Capital Association, these federal investments are in the hundreds of millions of dollars and mostly go to later-stage companies. This is state subsidy of an industry, and it may be good for economic development, but the potential for misspent money is greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Solyndra received a $535 million loan guarantee to build advanced thin-film solar panels and leapfrog technologically over Chinese manufacturers. Unfortunately, the Chinese simply lowered the cost of their labor. Solyndra has closed one plant in the United States, and its future is uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big government programs may be good for creating whole industries to compete in established areas. South Korea and China became a tremendous economic success helped in part by focused government investing in major exporting industries. But governments are not as good as creating the next <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or innovative technology. This remains the domain of these venture capital networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the need for a private element, there is a growing consensus that there is a government role in creating and fostering entrepreneurship. As the many failures illustrate, this is a slow process and requires tremendous effort and patience for an uncertain outcome, something for which money is no substitute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many state governments get this. States are creating business incubators and focusing efforts around the nation's big public research universities. It is hard to find a research university that does not have a tech transfer operation sitting alongside a business incubator. The university will transfer this technology for a fee to incubated companies and try to harvest new companies based on this technology. Tech transfer is usually life sciences and hardware, not Web-based businesses, but it can be significant. The University of California system made $125.3 million from licensed discoveries in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still the need for capital. Here the issue becomes harder. When is it appropriate for a government entity to provide capital when the market does not? In Ohio, Eric D. Fingerhut, who recently stepped down as chancellor of the Ohio State universities, led a state effort called Third Frontier to raise $700 million for alternative-energy and biomedical device initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third Frontier provides financing alongside private investments. This effort is buttressed by a reinvigorated tech transfer program at Ohio State and business incubators in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus. Ohio has not succeeded yet, but it is viewed as a leader in these efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is to use government money to create a network of entrepreneurs, tech people and investors that will become self-replicating. Silicon Valley is no doubt the best of the bunch, but states that are not working to foster this community are increasingly being shut out of the technology race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are not just public efforts. In New York, Factory TechStars has opened its fourth branch. This increasingly popular program selects 10 companies and provides seed money and mentorship. Seventy percent of their companies eventually get venture capital or ''angel'' financing. This is private, but these efforts are increasingly a place where state and private efforts exist side by side. Austin in particular benefited from the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a now-defunct consortium that was recruited by the city to foster entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No government is going to create the next <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. The race is really one to create systems to nurture the next superstar company. This is a place where public and private enterprise can heavily overlap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating this network is an uncertain task, though it helps to have a big research university nearby. You also need an entrepreneurial, educated culture, something the United States needs to keep building. But more states and private organizations need to focus on this goal. While the payoff is uncertain, the rewards can be spectacular.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment, while still indicating economic growth, declined on Friday, signaling that events in Japan and the Arab world could be making businesses more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ifo Business Climate Index, considered a reliable predictor of growth in the German economy, the largest in Europe, fell to 111.1 from 111.3, the first decline since May 2010. A reading above 100 indicates that the majority of the 7,000 businesses surveyed rate their current situation and expectations for the future as positive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the whole, firms in Germany remain very confident,'' Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich, said in the report. ''The business-cycle traffic lights still signal 'green.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was higher than expected and, along with data showing an increase in lending to European business, was not likely to dissuade the European Central Bank from raising the benchmark interest rate next month in a bid to pre-empt inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> noted that the Ifo index showed a decline in expectations for the future even as businesses remained pleased with the current situation. That could be a sign that businesses were worried about the effect of turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa on energy prices, as well as what effect the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan could have on supplies of Japanese-made products like auto parts. About half of the responses to the survey came after the earthquake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The marked decline in the expectation balance provides a first warning signal that business sentiment might be more strongly affected in the coming months if these adverse developments were sustained for much longer,'' <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> analysts said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emergency at the Fukushima nuclear power plants could also add to nervousness among German exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Ifo business climate is clearly in boom territory,'' Jorg Kramer, the <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span> chief economist, said in a note. But he added, ''The risks for the forecast are higher than usual. Should the situation in Fukushima escalate, against expectation, and put Tokyo at risk, this would then also affect Western economies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If businesses turn pessimistic, they may be less willing to invest in expansion and to hire more workers. Their reluctance would then cause overall growth in Germany to slow, a problem for all of Europe. Germany has been towing the rest of the Continent through economic turbulence caused by debt problems in Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Friday, the European Central Bank said that lending to business, not including banks and other financial institutions, rose 0.6 percent in February from a year earlier. That is a modest increase and indicates that inflationary pressures in Europe are low, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most analysts expect the E.C.B. to raise its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent from a record low of 1 percent when the bank's governing council meets April 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think the E.C.B. will take comfort from today's Ifo release,'' Jens Sondergaard, an analyst at Nomura, said in a note. ''An E.C.B. rate hike in April is likely.''</p>
