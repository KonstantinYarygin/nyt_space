<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Divining the potential of a start-up is a technology reporter's constant task. We spend a lot of our time trying to figure out which companies, both large and small, are newsworthy and why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not an exact science. It is more a balance between intuition and reporting. For clues, we look in part to venture capitalists who finance these companies because, after all, they want to bet on winners. These investors say they write checks for entrepreneurs who seem confident, capable and driven by an inner hunger that will carry them to success. They say they often prize these qualities more than the particular idea or company involved.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also talk to entrepreneurs, who often say a winning idea is one that invents a new way to do something -- like exchanging messages with your friends or finding the best restaurant. And we look at data, seeing which companies are gaining users quickly or attracting people who are particularly interesting to advertisers for one reason or another -- teenagers or women, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, none of these factors are necessarily enough to warrant coverage. An all-star roster of investors is not a surefire measure of success. Investors can bet on losers, too. Good entrepreneurs, almost by definition, are passionate about their pursuits, so that doesn't cut it, either. Gaining users is important, but what if the company isn't making money from its customers yet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tipping point -- the moment at a which a start-up moves from being an interesting company on the periphery of your radar to a notable one that is prime for covering is hard to pinpoint. In some ways, it's just a feeling based on experience. The app, game, service or idea that you have had your eye on starts to pop up all over -- in casual conversations at parties or in a conversation overheard on the subway. In some ways, gut instinct is the only way to distinguish between companies that perform identical function -- Vine versus Viddy, Instagram versus PicPlz, GroupMe versus FastSociety, WhatsApp versus Kik.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes we get it right, but we can also miss the mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, after <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> announced plans to buy Instagram for a mind-boggling $1 billion, a colleague and I tried to figure out which companies might be next. We waded through the list of companies we had noticed and picked the ones that seemed most promising for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One company that we originally put on the list was Tumblr, the popular microblogging service. But then we took it off. The company, founded in 2007, felt a bit older than the rest to be considered a start-up and while we knew plenty of people who used it obsessively, it seemed as if most of them worked in media in major coastal cities. We knew the company was self-reporting eye-popping page view numbers, more than other popular social media sites -- as far as we could determine. But Tumblr didn't seem to have a clear strategy for generating revenue or a plan for forward momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We went back and forth over whether it belonged, and then decided to take it off and keep it on a mental list of ''companies to watch.'' Either <span class="companylink">Quora</span> or Findery, formerly Pinwheel, took its place in the roundup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> bought the company for $1.1 billion, showing that it doesn't always take revenue or a clearly defined road map to attract big money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for our other picks last year, demand for Uber seems only to be increasing, reflecting rumors of a round of financing that would push the company's valuation into the multibillions. Similarly, <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span> seems to be sustaining its momentum, with more than twice as many visitors using the mobile application in the last year, according to comScore, a Web analytics firm. Path also appears to be drawing large numbers of users through mobile. And <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> is still widely considered to be a social media heavyweight and is now valued at $2.5 billion, thanks to a recent $200 million investment in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Quora</span>, on the other hand, has lost traffic to its home page in the last year, with a dip to 1.5 million visitors from 1.8 millions, according to comScore. Airtime and Findery weren't generating enough traffic at all to register on comScore's tools. And although the payments start-up Square has persuaded venture capitalists to funnel several hundred millions to its coffers, it seems to be struggling to gain that faith from consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, we have tried our luck again at picking a fresh crop of companies that seem poised to take off, both among consumers and among larger companies that might buy them for their talent and technology. As always, dozens were considered, but not all made the list, including VHX, a video-delivery service, Tinder, a popular dating app; Feedly, a news reading application; Leap Motion, a device that lets you control your computer with hand motions; or Dots, an addictive iPhone game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll have to wait another year to see how we did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

The hitch was that his wife, Melissa Kroning, 61, registrar of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, was still working full time. So globe-trotting was out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was just kind of hanging around the house,'' Mr. Lowe, 64, said. ''I decided I might as well try something else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, he had a good rapport with his son-in-law, John Uselton, now 40, a fellow enthusiast of home brewing, wine collecting and spirits -- with whom he found he could start a business. Their mutual passion for craft distilling eventually grew into New Columbia Distillers, the first microdistillery in Washington. In October, it rolled out the first bottling of its small-batch Green Hat distilled gin from an old warehouse holding their 15-foot solid copper still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of senior entrepreneurs like Mr. Lowe has been well documented. But start-ups like the one begun by Mr. Lowe and Mr. Uselton are a new twist in the trend, and a variant of traditional family businesses: so-called legacy partnerships. The partnerships are started at or near the older partner's retirement from a lifelong career, so two generations bring complementary assets to a new business. The assets are typically capital and experience from the older partner and energy, technical expertise or online marketing skills from the younger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many seniors are creating legacy businesses alongside a younger member of their family,'' said Elizabeth Isele, co-founder of Senior Entrepreneurship Works, a nonprofit that helps workers over 50 start businesses. ''It's a winning formula for both generations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are no statistics to document these new generational pairings, the trend appears to be gathering momentum in the current economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two unfortunate aspects of the ongoing jobs crisis may be driving the launch of new businesses by senior parents and younger members of their family,'' said John Dearie, a co-author of ''Where the Jobs Are: Entrepreneurship and the Soul of the American Economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''First, nearly half of recent college graduates have been unable to find work, and half of those with jobs report that the jobs they found don't require the degrees they earned,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Second, while the unemployment rate among older Americans is lower than for younger Americans, government statistics show that once older Americans lose their jobs, they tend to be unemployed for far longer, as finding new work is much more difficult. Given those realities, one can easily see how those two demographics might team up as entrepreneurs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some demographic groups, too, multigenerational start-ups are leading the way, Ms. Isele said. For example, Hispanic entrepreneurs are creating more legacy businesses than any other demographic, according to Yanira Cruz, head of the National Hispanic Council on Aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economic downturn hit this population very hard,'' Ms. Cruz said. The result has been family members working together to create small retail businesses like florist shops, restaurants and other businesses in the food industry, and service businesses like cleaning companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The culture has a lot to do with that approach,'' she said. ''We're raised to take care of our elders, and a commitment to care for one another has been projected onto starting a business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 1 rule is having a clear idea of what each partner brings to the table. ''We use a lot of what we learned in our backgrounds,'' Mr. Uselton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and Mr. Lowe share operating the still and developing recipes. Having worked as a beer buyer for a liquor store and a waiter at a top-tier Dupont Circle restaurant, Obelisk, before plunging into the distilling business, Mr. Uselton had a broad network of contacts in the restaurant and beverage business in the area. And his gregarious nature paid off at tastings arranged at local businesses, which were pivotal in spurring interest in the pair's artisanal gin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lowe handles the financial books and the regulatory compliance issues. He was a regulatory lawyer, after all. The partners had to get legislation passed through the District of Columbia City Council to permit them to sell the gin at the distillery and host tastings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One more thing that balances their duties: ''I am a skinny little old guy. I can't do a lot of the physical stuff,'' Mr. Lowe said. ''John can lift the big hoses, cases and bags of grain. There's a lot of physical labor involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With both men working 60-hour weeks, this year the distillery is on track to produce 2,000 cases of gin (retail price: $36 a fifth) for sale to 60 liquor stores and 140 bars and restaurants in Washington, and a growing number of outlets in Delaware and Maryland. Mr. Lowe figures that he has invested close to $1 million of his and his wife's savings in the business. But, he says, with $300,000 in revenue projected this year, he has already begun to repay it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months ago, Mr. Uselton took his first modest paycheck home to his wife, Elizabeth. She ''was very excited, to say the least,'' Mr. Uselton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which raises a question: Are legacy small businesses another form of helicopter parenting, or nepotism?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lowe dismisses that idea, insisting that both men came up with the idea of the distillery. ''And it seemed like it might give John a leg up, but it was up to him to decide voluntarily if he thought it was a good move,'' he said. ''It was a fair amount of risk for him to give up his day job and put all of his energy into this. It's nice to think that I will probably do this for 8 or 10 years, but it should be able to continue, and John can carry on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no arguing that helping a child get traction in the workplace is something many parents are willing to do, if they have the means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Francine Harmon, 53, a resident of Duluth, Ga., and her son Brandon Leatherman, 34, starting a business together was all about the paycheck. Both mother and son were out of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Ms. Harmon was laid off from her job as a human resources administrator for a trucking company in Tucker, Ga., during a downsizing. She was jobless for a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leatherman had a background in computer technology and finance, and Ms. Harmon knew about customer service from the 13 years she had worked in Citibank's processing center in Hagerstown, Md., doing phone work, customer service management and investigative duties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their solution: In 2011, the two started Born eCommerce. Their initial investment: under $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a home-based customer service business that is part of the Arise network of outsourced call center representatives. Ms. Harmon was uncertain about the logistics and technical needs of starting her own firm, so she teamed up with her son to handle the setup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he handles the day-to-day business needs, including accounting, bookkeeping and technology. Ms. Harmon solves problems on the telephone help lines for customers of the firm's clients <span class="companylink">Carnival Cruise Lines</span>, AAA and ADT Security Systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another mutual advantage for senior and junior entrepreneurs can be a moral purpose, Ms. Isele, of Senior Entrepreneurship Works, said. ''People at this age really want to create a business that has some kind of social impact on their community, if not the world. And often the younger workers carry the same sense of idealism on their sleeves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Nancy Burkhart, 69, graduated in 1966 from U.C.L.A. with a degree in anthropology, she ''wanted to save the world,'' she recalled. And today, with the help of her daughter Jessica Arellano, 36, she feels as if she is doing that, in her own way. The two own and operate Earth Safe Finishes, a nontoxic paint and finishes company based in Moorpark, Calif., that they founded in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impetus for the business was Ms. Burkhart's divorce. ''Jessica helped me find my way,'' she recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Burkhart was not a neophyte. She had already been an owner of three companies that developed and manufactured paints and varnishes for the craft industry. But she was determined to create paints and varnishes with fewer toxins, a goal shared by Ms. Arellano, who graduated from the college of natural resources at Berkeley. She also had expertise in nontoxic technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Burkhart attributes their success to the support she received from other entrepreneurial women and from local agencies, like the Ventura County Score group, which is composed of retired executives who provide counseling to small businesses, and the Ventura County Small Business Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She financed the start-up with a little bit of money her mother had left her and now figures she has about $150,000 invested in it. Not surprisingly, customers are typically new parents or pregnant women who are redoing a nursery. Women in their 50s who are into refinishing furniture are also big buyers. With such business, the two are able to pay themselves annual salaries of about $50,000 each. ''That's enough to make ends meet,'' Ms. Burkhart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes everything tick?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know each other's strengths and weaknesses and fill in the gaps accordingly,'' Ms. Arellano said. ''My mother knows I do not really like phone conversations; she loves them. She does not like paperwork; I don't mind it. I think that not all parent-child relationships would work for start-ups unless each person is able to cover what the other lacks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is most important? ''Mutual respect,'' Ms. Burkhart said. ''You have to step away from that parent-child relationship. It has to be the business relationship.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOHNNE JONES had always dreamed of being an architect or interior designer. Suzie Ford wanted to know if the home-brewed beer her husband, Todd, made was as good as people said it was, while Jan Morris figured owning a distillery would be more fun than being a divorce lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had three very different dreams, but these women had one thing in common: they all lost jobs and decided to use sizable retirement accounts to start their own businesses in very different fields. They did so by converting traditional 401(k) accounts into new retirement plans -- known as ''rollovers as business start-ups,'' or ROBS -- that they could invest in their companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's fueled by the fact that stock market has returned to all-time highs, real estate is up, consumer confidence is up -- but we're also suffering from a credit crisis, and unemployment remains high,'' said David Nilssen, chief executive of Guidant Financial, which specializes in helping people use 401(k) assets to invest in businesses or other nontraditional assets, like property. ''People look at this because they can capitalize a business without taking on any debt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this may sound like an easy solution to finance a company, it is incredibly complicated, and the risks of running afoul of the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> or the Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over 401(k) plans, are significant. The worst possible outcome is a triple-whammy loss of a person's retirement savings, the business and a source of income if the idea fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the complications, ROBS exist in a parallel financial universe, where those who promote the plans see them as solutions for retirement-rich but cash-poor entrepreneurs, while many other financial advisers see the plans as treading the line of legality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The I.R.S. has said that they don't view them as tax-avoidance schemes per se,'' said Carol J. Ventura, retirement specialist at H.D. Vest, a broker-dealer with $33 billion under management. ''They're not illegal, but the I.R.S. is saying that they have to be perfectly put in place. They're very complicated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failure to do everything right could lead to anything from penalties to having the entire retirement plan disallowed, which would mean a big tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Nilssen said the idea had been gaining in popularity. He said his company had its best year in 2012 with 1,300 new ROBS and expects to do 1,700 this year. I wanted to know what the attraction was to something that seemed so complicated and magnified the sizable risk of starting any business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how ROBS work: People take their 401(k) account (or other qualified retirement plan) and roll it over into a new plan that buys shares in an operating company that will own their business. Unlike most small businesses, which are set up as limited liability corporations or S-corporations, a business financed through ROBS has to be a C-corporation, which can issue shares and does not prohibit ownership by trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, people turn to ROBS because they don't have other sources of financing and have not been able to secure a small-business loan.The companies of the people I spoke to were owned by anywhere from 90 percent of one person's 401(k) to 100 percent of two entire plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might sound simple, but what effectively happens is that the plan, not the person, owns the business. That means the person cannot act in his best interest but must act in the best interest of the plan. For example, if he wants to give himself a raise, he needs to find out what similar business owners make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have counseled people on how to do them correctly and then I typically say, 'I find it to be a bad idea and you're probably going to get yourself in trouble,' '' said Bill Smith, a tax lawyer and managing director in the CBIZ National Tax Office. ''The I.R.S. is not consistent on what it considers correct. It's very easy to mess these things up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nilssen said Guidant helped people set up the initial plan and managed the reporting requirements. He said that of his firm's 8,500 clients, about 50 had been audited, but none had had action taken against them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jones said that in the course of putting $260,000 of the $340,000 she had in her retirement account into buying a <span class="companylink">Decorating Den</span> franchise in Nashville, she had several lean years during the recession, but that she is now doing well. She says she is also happier than when she was working in health care technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said the paperwork to comply with the I.R.S. rules could be complicated -- and managing paperwork was part of her previous career. One requirement of these plans is that she and any employees pay into the 401(k) set up to buy the company. ''That check has to be out the door seven days after payroll,'' she said. ''If I'm late at writing a check to deposit my 401(k) money, there are penalties, and I've paid penalties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are worse ways to run afoul of the law. Mr. Smith pointed to a recent United States Tax Court case, Peek v. Commissioner, where the business owners used their retirement accounts to buy a fire and safety firm and later sold it at a significant profit. The court, however, declared that their gains were taxable because they had also secured loans with their homes to buy the business. While this is something small-business owners do regularly, it is a prohibited transaction under I.R.S. guidelines for ROBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And people had better be confident this structure is right for them. Unwinding a business created through ROBS, so that the gains or losses do not have to go back to the retirement plan, may not be possible without a sale to a third party or a total loss, said Ms. Ventura. The I.R.S. rules are just too strict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But considering the enthusiasm anyone has going into a new business, particularly after years of not being terribly happy in a job, it is not surprising that details get overlooked. Ms. Morris, 61, said that after she was laid off as a lawyer, she and her husband, 63, helped their son start a brewery, and that ''he was having a good time with his brewery, so I thought I could do a distillery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After taking a weeklong course in distilling spirits, she got excited about the idea and had begun applying for a small-business loan when her bank suggested she talk to Guidant. Now, she said, the couple had put 100 percent of both of their 401(k) accounts into the Hardware Distillery in Hoodsport, Wash., about two hours outside of Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked how she felt about such concentrated risk in their 60s, she said, ''I think it's all going to come out O.K. in the end.'' If it doesn't, she added, they at least own the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nilssen said his firm did not counsel clients on how much of their retirement accounts to use. But to critics who say that ROBS are used primarily by older, less sophisticated entrepreneurs, he said: ''People are coming to us after they've built their idea, found a franchise, or secured a business to buy. We don't get into whether or not someone should be an entrepreneur.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where having independent legal and tax counsel is important for anyone thinking of ROBS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Hanson, principal at Hanson McClain, which manages $1.6 billion, said he was generally against the idea of tapping a retirement account to invest in a business beyond taking a loan out against a 401(k), which is capped at $50,000. If people needed more, he said, they would be better off taking the money out, paying the income taxes -- and a 10 percent penalty if they're under 59 ½ -- and setting up an S-corporation that would allow them to take any losses on their tax return, which is something they cannot benefit from by owning a business through a retirement plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe I'm biased because I've seen situations where people have drained their retirement account down to nothing and the business fails,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if everything goes well, selling the business is not as simple as it would be if the person owned it outright. Since the 401(k) plan owns the business, the person who benefits from the plan has to have the business valued and sell if for fair market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so complex that I've put it out of my head,'' said Ms. Jones, who is 62 and plans to work until she is 70. She said she hoped her employee would want it. ''I told him that if he stayed that long he can have it, but you can't legally do that. And I can't sell it to him for $1 either because the I.R.S. won't allow this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until that point, though, if the business is successful it can be enjoyed like any other good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ford, a former community banker, and her husband, Todd, a former airline pilot, used all of their 401(k) accounts and also took out an equipment loan to start the NoDa Brewing Company in Charlotte, N.C. But they have used cash flow to expand the business three times since founding it in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We truly believed in what we were doing and understood how risky this was,'' said Ms. Ford, 46. ''We did the market research. We hired a great team. We surrounded ourselves with good people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''Worst-case scenario, we would go off and get other jobs, but we just tried not to focus on that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years into the venture, their beer is now served at 325 sites including the major sporting arenas in the city. ''We have good, consistent beer and that's the difference,'' she said. If only it were that simple.</p>

In March, Rob Thomas, creator of the TV series ''Veronica Mars,'' and Kristen Bell, the star of the show, used Kickstarter to finance ''Veronica Mars'' the movie. They set a target of $2 million and ultimately brought in $5.7 million from more than 90,000 donors. In April, the actor-director Zach Braff raised $3.1 million for a follow-up to his 2004 directorial debut, ''Garden State.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the summer Spike Lee, the two-time Academy Award nominee, took in $1.4 million for an untitled film about ''human beings who are addicted to blood.'' And two weeks ago Maria Pinto, who designed a dress Michelle Obama wore at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, launched a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of reaching $250,000 for a new line of women's clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter, once the domain of unknowns seeking their first big break, is now also a resource for big names intrigued by the potential of micropatronage. Not surprisingly, this cultural shift has spurred howls of protest, with critical essays on celebrity ''panhandling'' washing over the media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two main arguments against the celebrity invasion. First is that it's in poor taste for the rich-and-famous to solicit money from the public when they presumably have access to more traditional financing or might even be able to self-finance projects. The second is that, like affluent professionals descending on a cheap, hip neighborhood, celebrities are making Kickstarter less hospitable to aspiring artists. In May, the director Kevin Smith said he would never ''suck any loot out of the crowdfunding marketplace that might otherwise go to a first-timer who can really use it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aversion to deep-pocketed stars on Kickstarter is understandable. But a big name does not guarantee access to financing for creative projects. Even established artists may struggle to attract investment -- a point Mr. Lee made about his own experience in defending his decision to try crowdfunding. Besides, anyone who feels uncomfortable is under no obligation to give.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And contrary to what some believe, Kickstarter is not a zero-sum game. Instead of vacuuming up finite resources, celebrity campaigns seem to widen the donor pool. Forty-seven percent of Mr. Lee's backers had never before contributed on Kickstarter. Once drawn in by a celebrity, donors may patronize lesser-known artists. As the Kickstarter founders wrote on their blog in August, the ''Veronica Mars'' and Zach Braff bids ''brought thousands of new people to Kickstarter who have since pledged more than $1 million to 6,000 other projects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gentrification of Kickstarter doesn't seem to be hurting its original inhabitants. It may even be helping them.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogusky is known in the industry for the risk-taking, rule-breaking creative ideas he came up with in the more than two decades he spent at <span class="companylink">Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky</span> and its parent, <span class="companylink">MDC Partners</span>. Since 2010, when he left <span class="companylink">MDC</span>, he has started projects like Common and FearLess Revolution. He also joined Made Movement, a fledgling agency in Boulder, Colo., as a minority investor and creative adviser.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Bogusky is helping an agency in Chattanooga, Tenn., open its doors by becoming a minority investor and creative adviser there, too. The new agency -- in keeping with Mr. Bogusky's seeming penchant for affiliating with nontraditionally named ventures -- is known as Humanaut, a word coined from human and astronaut (or cosmonaut, if you are a Russian Op-Ed columnist).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm the world's smallest holding company,'' Mr. Bogusky said, laughing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Appleseed comparison was suggested, he said he liked it. ''Just seeds in his pocket and holes in his pocket,'' Mr. Bogusky said. ''I'm just a guy with money falling out of my pocket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogusky knows one of the two founders of Humanaut, David Littlejohn, because they worked together in the Boulder office of <span class="companylink">Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky</span>. The other Humanaut founder, Andrew Clark, is a longtime friend of Mr. Littlejohn's; before starting Humanaut, they had collaborated for two years as consultants for start-ups -- advising them in areas like brand identity and user experience -- under the banner of a company with another unusual name, Pale Dot Voyage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''David really, really inspired me during his time at C.P.B.,'' Mr. Bogusky said, citing as an example an effort for <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> called Twelpforce, in which employees in <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> stores used <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> to answer customers' questions in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Andrew, who I met through David, is crazy smart,'' Mr. Bogusky said, ''and that's always important.'' Mr. Clark and Mr. Littlejohn worked with Mr. Bogusky several months ago on advertising for the <span class="companylink">SodaStream</span> home soda-making system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogusky said that, around the time he left <span class="companylink">MDC</span>, he believed he was ''out of ideas on how to innovate.'' But recently, he added, ''some potential ways to innovate have come to me through friends who want to do agencies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although ''a lot of people in advertising want to do ads,'' Mr. Bogusky said, he preferred to be involved with people who want to ''build products that add value to the experience'' that consumers have with a brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Littlejohn, 31, is the chief creative director at Humanaut. Mr. Clark, 33, is the chief strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of great things that come along with Alex,'' Mr. Littlejohn said. ''There are some great connections he's introduced us to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The name Humanaut is intended to suggest ''kind of a human explorer,'' Mr. Littlejohn said, ''exploring the new frontier of digital and what it means to have these phones in our pockets, these glasses and watches.'' He described Humanaut as ''a brand invention agency, helping clients invent and innovate, using tools to innovate how people experience a product or business beyond advertising, helping start-ups that lack a brand identity or a brand story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the agency's Web site, humanaut.is, which is to go live on Wednesday, are declarations like ''We are a creative agency exploring how brands and technology collide with humans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humanaut is working with clients that include Friends of the Earth and <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span>. The agency also works on developing and introducing products and brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such initiative is Felt, an app that mixes high- and low-technology; after users write cards by hand on their iPads, the cards, with accompanying envelopes, are printed, sealed, stamped and mailed through the Postal Service. The Web site describes Felt as ''exploring how handwriting and iPads collide with Mother's Day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another venture is Swoop, with a goal of enabling mobile users who are at football games, baseball games or other sporting events to sell their seats once they are inside a stadium or arena. Swoop is described on the Web site as ''exploring how stadiums and mobile auctions collide with sports fans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Humanaut angle is using new technologies to reinvent age-old human experiences,'' Mr. Clark said. ''A lot of agencies out there are trying to navigate this space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humanaut has seven employees and, according to Mr. Clark and Mr. Littlejohn, has ambitious growth plans. ''We're looking for designers and writers and developers,'' Mr. Littlejohn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chattanooga is not known for advertising agencies, but then again, neither was Boulder when <span class="companylink">Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky</span> decided in 2006 to open an office there that would serve as a dual headquarters for the agency along with its operation in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Littlejohn said he opened Pale Dot Voyage in Chattanooga because he ''had some family there,'' adding, ''There were huge amounts of opportunity and office space for what seemed like pocket change.'' Mr. Clark moved to Chattanooga from Chicago to join him in fall 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogusky called Chattanooga ''a great, young market with a lot of cool talent, but affordable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he was interested in planting more seeds through additional investments in agencies, Mr. Bogusky replied: ''I wish I had more of a plan around it, but right now, I don't. If I do it again, I'd be more formal about it, but I don't have plans right now to do it again.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRIGHTON, England -- Hoping to woo disillusioned voters after three years in the opposition, Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party, promised on Tuesday to freeze energy bills and cut taxes on small companies by squeezing more from big business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking without notes for an hour at his party's annual conference, Mr. Miliband addressed criticism of his leadership and attacked the government of Prime Minister David Cameron, saying that it would channel the fruits of Britain's nascent economic recovery to the rich.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miliband has had a difficult few weeks. He failed to capitalize on a parliamentary defeat that Mr. Cameron suffered over intervening in Syria, and found himself damaged by association when a former Labour political operative published a tell-all memoir about skulduggery and infighting during the last Labour government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his speech on Tuesday injected some energy into what had been a low-key Labour conference, with less than two years to go until the next general election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miliband said he would relish a debate with Mr. Cameron about leadership and character. Mr. Cameron and his Conservatives, Mr. Miliband said, would engineer a ''recovery for the few,'' not for the majority of Britons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They used to say, 'A rising tide lifts all boats,' '' he said. ''Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest task confronting Mr. Miliband is to persuade voters who seem to blame the last Labour government, as much as the current center-right coalition, for unpopular austerity measures in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to a temporary freeze on energy prices to help budget-strapped consumers, he promised to spur construction of 200,000 homes a year and to expand child care, financed by a tax increase on banks. General corporate taxes, however, would be cut, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But trying to align Labour with small business rather than banks and big corporations, Mr. Miliband drew a negative reaction from the country's largest business lobby, the <span class="companylink">Confederation of British Industry</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Businesses will view the proposals on tax and energy as a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials,'' said John Cridland, the group's director general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opinion polls rate Mr. Miliband as less popular than his party, in part because he gained the party leadership by challenging and defeating his elder brother, David, in 2010. Mr. Miliband presented that on Tuesday as an act of leadership, saying it was ''really hard for my family.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he managed a joke about his public image, recounting an encounter with a voter who said he was ''not geeky at all.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said the starting date for small businesses was less important than the one for the individual market because businesses are not limited to enrolling during only part of a year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics pounced anyway, accusing the administration of accepting delays for businesses while refusing Republican demands for a delay in the requirement that individuals get insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every step in the implementation process has seen delays and setbacks; we are certainly not surprised by this one,'' said Kevin Kuhlman, the manager of legislative affairs for the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This law is a disaster, but the exchanges -- the heart of the law -- are supposed to go live in just five days? Give me a break,'' he said. ''This law will never be ready for prime time.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s prospectus for an initial public offering was disclosed last week, showing that the brouhaha about its confidential filing was much ado about very little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not as if the criticism of the new rules that allowed the company to first file privately has gone away. Instead, the disclosure showed something refreshing for a young technology company these days: <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is acting like an adult.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not have been apparent in August when <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> announced -- via a tweet, naturally -- that it had filed its initial I.P.O. prospectus confidentially. The 2012 Jump Start Our Business Start-ups, or JOBS Act, made that possible, allowing companies to file their offering documents confidentially to be reviewed by the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. Once the review is done, the I.P.O. documents are made public. The idea is to provide a period for small companies to test the waters and perhaps avoid a media frenzy like the one that accompanied <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> as each version of its I.P.O. document was feverishly reviewed and commented on in public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act has its opponents, though, and has been criticized for reducing regulation but not really doing much to encourage offerings. The <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> I.P.O. released some of this pent-up criticism as commentators assailed the confidentiality of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s filing, asserting that the public would lose out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s case, though, it doesn't seem like the confidentiality provisions helped. The reason is that the eventual public filing didn't change much from the original confidential one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compare the confidential and the public <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> prospectuses, I ran them through plagiarism software to see the amount of change from the two versions. The idea is that the more changes there are, the more intensive the S.E.C. review and the less prepared the initial filing were. The <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> I.P.O. filing released last week had 86 percent of the initial one's content.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare this with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> and <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>'s final I.P.O. prospectuses were 78 percent similar to their initial one, while <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>'s final filing was 68 percent similar to its initial filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span> will most likely update its prospectus again with new information before it goes public. So far, it has filed four versions of its prospectus, while <span class="companylink">Zynga</span> had nine amendments. A perusal of the <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> I.P.O. documents also shows that the changes from one filing to another are not terribly significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> eventually noted that up to 5 percent of its users might be spammers, but the accounting numbers had few changes -- and most of them were updates for the next quarter. Most of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s other revisions that were not related to accounting appear to be about a new incentive compensation program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for the fewer changes may be that <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> simply did a better job on its initial filing and didn't try to play games. In the cases of <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, for example, the companies pushed the envelope on their accounting, using novel metrics more akin to Grouponics and Zyngametrics than real accounting numbers. Faced with this, is there any wonder that the S.E.C. pushed back, resulting in more changes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only that, but <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> surprised many by electing to maintain a more traditional corporate governance structure, spurning the dual-class shares that are in favor with technology companies because they give the founders control of the company. For example, Mark Pincus, the founder of <span class="companylink">Zynga</span>, issued himself shares that had 70 votes apiece, and Mark Zuckerberg of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> put in place voting stock that could conceivably give his heirs control of the social networking company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And unlike the I.P.O.'s for other tech companies, in which the founders cash in by selling their shares, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is the only seller and its founders are holding their shares. <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> also elected to largely not follow the rest of the JOBS Act rules for less disclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, the <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> I.P.O. looks more like a mature company's I.P.O.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a lesson here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> announced that it had made a confidential filing, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>'s co-founder, Andrew Mason, wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>: ''Confidential S1s? But what could be wrong with releasing 100s of pages of new financial and strategic co. info to the Internet while gagged?'' While Mr. Mason may be decrying the regulatory process, he has only himself to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since <span class="companylink">Google</span> sought to sell its I.P.O. shares in a modified Dutch auction, the princes of Silicon Valley have believed that not only can they change the way we use technology, but that they should change everything else, including the I.P.O. process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation can be a good thing, but when it comes to I.P.O.'s, it often hasn't worked. In some cases, these companies have appeared to be petulantly saying that anything other than their way is suboptimal. In the case of the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> I.P.O., the company came off looking as if it was acting to benefit itself at the expense of its new shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span> appears to be the first big tech I.P.O. in which a company simply prepared a thorough filing without pushing the boundaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this light, perhaps confidentiality provisions did not do as much for <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> as simply doing a good job did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidentiality may be a good thing for companies that do not have their act together. But it can cut both ways. Maybe the S.E.C. will be harder on those companies because of the confidentiality granted to them and the fact that they are not being scrutinized publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commentators have also focused on the fact that information is lost when a review is made in private, but perhaps the real virtue of public scrutiny is that it exposes the companies that have not done a thorough job. And admittedly, if each <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> revision had been made public, there would have been media attention with each filing. But that is what goes with becoming a public company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This still does not mean that all will go smoothly for <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s I.P.O. Over the weekend, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>'s chief executive ended up getting into a spat about the lack of women in high positions at the company, which was not a good idea. Still, the fact that <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> is simply pursuing an I.P.O. on relatively friendly shareholder terms rather than trying to transform the markets is a good sign. The future billionaires of Silicon Valley may want to pay attention. Humility and diligence can sometimes work wonders for your I.P.O.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Leh, the owner of a fledgling manufacturing company in Ephrata, Pa., recently landed the kind of deal that growing companies dream about, with a major client whose order volume will triple his annual sales to around $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the new business requires a significant expansion of his production capabilities, Mr. Leh, 46, began hunting for additional employees and lining up financing to buy new equipment for his precision machine components company, TL Technologies. Last week, he was poised to close on a $1.5 million loan backed by the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the government shut down. Mr. Leh's lender, <span class="companylink">Susquehanna Bank</span> in Lititz, Pa., says it is prepared to cut a check -- but cannot do it until the S.B.A. and other government agencies reopen and process some final paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just missed the window, and now we've come to a complete standstill,'' Mr. Leh said. ''I have to go back to my customer and tell him I'm dead in the water and can't fulfill his needs, and I can't give him an answer when I can. It's put me in the most horrible position as a business owner that you can be in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> says it backs an average of $96 million in small-business lending each day. Having that financing stream frozen sets off a chain reaction of economic pain, said Anthony R. Wilkinson, who heads the <span class="companylink">National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders</span>, a trade group. ''There are restaurants that aren't being opened and contracts that aren't being fulfilled,'' he said. ''As this drags on into Week 2, people are getting pretty worried.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The toll may not be conspicuous yet in the broader economy, but at the local level, the ripples are spreading. At many banks, direct small business lending is stalled too, because much of the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> is closed, preventing lenders from checking tax information provided by applicants. Business owners are also grappling with the absence of other crucial government services, like E-Verify, the online system companies use to confirm the eligibility of prospective employees to work in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uncertainty all of this causes is the most maddening part, said Chris Mittelstaedt, 44, owner of the FruitGuys, a produce-delivery company in South San Francisco, Calif. Mr. Mittelstaedt spent part of last week fielding phone calls from customers of his company's school distribution program, which is financed by federal grants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary funds came through at the end of the week, but he is frustrated by the confusion he and his customers face. ''If businesses are uncertain, they don't spend,'' he said. ''That's really bothersome for us and any growing company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leh, the manufacturer in Pennsylvania, is quick to trace out the ripple effects of his delayed financing. His prospective new client, of course, is kept waiting. So far, Mr. Leh said, the client is being patient and waiting along with him for the shutdown to be resolved. In addition, Mr. Leh has extended offers to two prospective employees, but he will not be able to bring them on until the loan actually closes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also waiting, he said, are ''the guys that I'm buying the machines from, the guys who move the machines, the electricians that come in and wire things up, the insurance company I'm dealing with -- all of those people aren't getting paid right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, he intended to turn over a check for $57,000 to JBM Technologies, a machine-tool distributor based in nearby Ivyland that works with manufacturing companies throughout the mid-Atlantic region. The check, a down payment on the first machine Mr. Leh needs, would have gone to John Watkins, the owner of the 20-person company. Instead, the machine -- a $300,000 Kitamura machining center about the size of a small room -- is sitting idle on Mr. Watkins's shop floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Watkins planned to have his staff begin work several days ago customizing Mr. Leh's Kitamura. When the loan was delayed, Mr. Watkins scrambled to redeploy his employees. ''We got busy at the right time with another project,'' he said. ''Without that, it would have been really bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What irritates Mr. Watkins most about the standoff in Washington is that he sees it as a self-inflicted wound on an economy that was finally beginning to rebound. One of his clients is in negotiations with a Swedish financier about backing the transfer of a major manufacturing line from China to the United States. ''We're on the brink of getting people to invest, and then this,'' Mr. Watkins said. ''What does this look like? Who wants to invest in a country that goes through this?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the shutdown on some small businesses is obvious and direct. For example, Dee Ann Smith, 56, the owner of Discover Yosemite, a company that runs day tours through Yosemite National Park, estimates that she is losing $3,500 in ticket sales every day the park remains closed. The hourly employees who lead tours are not being paid, while the salaries for Ms. Smith's office staff are eating into the cash reserve she had set aside to offset the slow winter season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tour company has also stopped buying fuel for its buses from a local gas station, and packed lunches for its hikers from a nearby deli. ''That's 20 to 40 sales a day they're missing out on,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other businesses, the impact of the shutdown is more nuanced. In Lansdowne, Pa., Ari Miller, 37, is trying to build a food company, 1732 Meats. His creations -- including jalapeño, black peppercorn and ''garlic insanity'' bacon -- have done well at local farmers' markets, and he wants to begin wholesale production for retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Miller needs certifications from the United States Agriculture Department for every step of his expansion. While the agency's meat inspectors are deemed essential and remain on the job, its packaging inspectors are not. Mr. Miller had a <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> envelope stuffed with proposed bacon labels ready to send off for approval Oct. 1 -- the day the government shut down. Until those labels are approved, he cannot begin commercial operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have an investor, we have hard costs -- we're paying rent on our production kitchen even if we're not using it -- but we don't have any way to generate revenue,'' Mr. Miller said. The farmers' market season ends this month, leaving him with no sales channel until he can get into stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had hoped to ramp up in time for the holidays, but now he is watching that window start to close. Fifteen business days is the standard turnaround time for packaging approval, he said, but others in the industry have warned him that the Agriculture Department will be inundated when it finally reopens. ''We've heard that you essentially have to add two to three days for every day they're closed because of the backlog,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many, that is the biggest concern -- that even after the government finally restarts, it could take weeks for the gears to unjam. Lynn Ozer, the president of Small Business Administration and government-guaranteed lending at <span class="companylink">Susquehanna Bank</span>, has five clients, including Mr. Leh, waiting to close on loans. Many can be fast-tracked once the S.B.A. reopens, but for those that require special handling, she worries how long it will take the agency to dig out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is also braced for her loan business to dry up, especially with the Treasury Department expected to hit its debt ceiling around Oct. 17. The last time Congress had this kind of standoff, in August 2011, business confidence took a dive -- and with it, Ms. Ozer said, went her clients' willingness to borrow money to hire and expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leh said he was monitoring the debt-ceiling fight in despair. ''The thing that's literally scaring me to death is this reckless behavior,'' he said. ''They're going to drive the interest rates up. I'm on a 6 percent variable loan -- if it goes up two points, that's a huge impact for a business my size. And there's nothing you can do. You just watch the madness continue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ozer said she heard dozens of times each day from business owners with similar concerns, and it infuriated her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just as small entrepreneurs are willing to take some risks again, the government goes and begins to behave like irresponsible children,'' she said. ''They make decisions that adversely affect the economy, when it's so fragile to begin with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real tea party threw tea into the Boston harbor. These people are throwing businesses and people's salaries.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARTIES THAT COOK is a 14-year-old event business founded in San Francisco by Bibby Gignilliat, a former marketing manager at <span class="companylink">Williams-Sonoma</span> who followed her muse -- first by going to cooking school and then by starting a business that offers cooking classes as employee-appreciation and corporate team-building events. It now handles events for as many as 300 in San Francisco as well as in Chicago, Seattle and Portland, Ore., where it maintains satellite offices. The company employs 11 full-time workers at its headquarters, and about 65 chefs, servers and dishwashers on a contract basis. Last year, revenue reached $2.2 million.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CHALLENGE Seeking to revive her long-neglected personal life, Ms. Gignilliat announced to her core staff in January 2010 that she was stepping back. She would continue to work, but she would cut back her hours and work mostly from home. The business did well, $1.85 million in revenue in 2010, with her on reduced hours. Last fall, however, she decided she wanted to re-engage -- and double sales in four years. Her hope was that she could re-energize the business without demoralizing those who had been running it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE BACKGROUND A decade after starting her business, Ms. Gignilliat had an epiphany, when, as a panelist at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., she heard herself referred to as the owner of a ''lifestyle business.'' ''Lifestyle?'' she muttered to herself. ''I have no life.'' For years, she had been logging 80-hour weeks. Soon to turn 50, she was unmarried. ''I'd stopped traveling. Stopped reading. I had no social life. I realized I was dating my business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gignilliat took great pride in the business she had built from first-year sales of $40,000. Her creative offerings ranged from an $85-a-person, small-plate, stand-up meal to a high-end, Iron Chef-like competitive experience for $125 a person. Some months, Parties That Cook averaged two events a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like many founders, Ms. Gignilliat worked so hard creating, managing and building her business that she sacrificed her personal life and burned out. Her self-prescribed remedy: work less, play more. ''The first three months, I'd forgotten what I liked to do,'' she said. But gradually, she downshifted from her customary fifth gear to what she pegs as second, working maybe 30 hours a week when she was not traveling. She started working out with a trainer and lost 10 pounds. She set off on several ''bucket list'' vacations, fly-fishing in Idaho and trekking in Bhutan. She hosted dinner parties for singles, and she fell into a close personal relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of necessity, she delegated many of the company operations that she had continued to manage, like menu development, Web design and staff training. As she learned that Parties That Cook could survive without her constant attention, Ms. Gignilliat disengaged further -- or ''checked out,'' as some of her employees termed her status in 2012. ''The pendulum swung a bit too far,'' she said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fall 2012 her boyfriend suggested that she consider ''re-engaging and taking the business to the next level.'' Those words struck a chord. Recognizing that she would want to sell the business by the time she was 60, only seven years hence, she realized she needed to create as much value as possible -- ''so I could sell it and retire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November 2012, meeting at her home with two longtime employees to discuss budgeting and forecasts for the next year, Ms. Gignilliat slipped into a de facto announcement of her return to active duty. She set an aggressive sales target of $2.7 million for 2013, up from 2012 sales of $2.18 million. ''I think we can do it,'' she said, ''because I'm stepping back in. I'm re-engaging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking guidance, Ms. Gignilliat hired a business coach for leadership and personal advice but was unable to begin those sessions until after she stepped back in. She sought additional one-on-one counseling from Jim Horan, a speaker and author, because she was eager to use Mr. Horan's One Page Business Plan to motivate her staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OPTIONS With the decision to step back in made, the lingering question was how she would pull it off. She had prided herself on a collaborative management style, but now she was simultaneously re-engaging and dictating an ambitious sales target. How would her team react? And how should her C.E.O. 3.0 role look? Could she ensure that she would stay engaged and not burn out again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT OTHERS SAY Stephen McDonnell, founder and chief executive of Applegate Organic &amp; Natural Meats in Bridgewater, N.J.: ''This case study strikes home as I find myself in the same dilemma. Most founders either let go too early and things fall apart, or they stay on too long, and then things start getting weird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My guidance is to test how self-aware you really are. You want to make sure you don't try to become something you are not. You will also need to force yourself to make difficult transitions that are not easy -- it's all about letting go of control. You might want to think about the business in three parts: strategy, process and operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As you already manage collaboratively, tell your team that strategies will be collectively developed but that you will hold the final decision. For process, which focuses on the culture and management style of how things get done, let the majority vote of the management team carry the day. And with day-to-day operations, delegate that responsibility to your managers. Respect the people you hire and get out of their way. And when you can't help yourself from jumping in when you see something being executed terribly -- and you will -- make sure you apologize and promise to never do it again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Cloutier, founder and chief executive of American Management Services, which specializes in turning around small and midsize companies: ''Ms. Gignilliat should face the music and realize that she will have to fully engage again, probably curtailing her lifestyle dramatically. To achieve her sales goals, she will have to get back into the thick of it. She will have to install a demanding pay-for-performance system and strict accountability across her operation, as well as be prepared to replace ineffective or poor-performing individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She must give up the fantasy of having a great work/lifestyle balance and put her nose to the grindstone -- and most of all, make sure she has a strong profit, because only that will ensure a worthwhile sales price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ricky Eisen, owner of Between the Bread, a catering and event-planning company in New York City: ''Since she set such an ambitious sales goal for her team, it would make sense for her to start in sales and marketing. Rainmakers are always the heroes, so if she can invigorate the sales team, create interesting marketing programs and personally promote her business, she will be accepted as the C.E.O. She should not assume any of the day-to-day responsibilities, which are so ably being handled by others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She may also want to offer her team leaders additional incentives -- financial and otherwise -- for meeting their goals. Some of them may be displaced, and the additional incentives will soothe some egos. Since her team did so well in her absence, she may want to consider selling her business to these employees when she is ready to retire.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day before the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> voted last week to propose rules to put in effect the crowdfunding section of last year's JOBS Act, people on different sides of the issue -- those favoring investor protection and those seeking to make it easier for companies to raise capital -- appeared to fear the worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've waited so long for the shoe to drop that you think it's never going to,'' said D. J. Paul, a co-founder of Crowdfund Intermediary Regulatory Advocates, a trade association for the new industry. ''Now I'm just afraid that the shoe might drop on our head.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after more than a year of delay, the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>'s preliminary crowdfunding rules passed unanimously. The public has 90 days to comment, and it could be at least six more months before final rules are issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many industry backers breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could not be happier with the diligence and thoughtfulness the commission staff put into it,'' Mr. Paul said after starting to read -- but not having finished -- the 585-page regulation. ''I saw some things that were good. I didn't see anything that was deeply troubling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act was an effort to get more capital, mostly in the form of stocks and bonds, into growing companies. It established a securities crowdfunding industry modeled on the work of companies like Kickstarter, which raises money as donations or in exchange for perks or rewards. Under the law, small companies can raise up to $1 million from small investors each year through financial intermediaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the law places limits, tied to income and net worth, on how much a person can invest in crowdfunded offerings in a year, intermediaries can rely on investors to provide that information. Anything more rigorous, the intermediaries had claimed, would stifle the new industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rules would require intermediaries to provide educational material to investors on the nature and risks of crowdfunding, they do not prescribe how that needs to be done. The rules also permit companies that offer stock or debt through crowdfunding to raise money simultaneously through private placements. Many crowdfunding intermediaries intend to facilitate such private stock transactions, or have already begun to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The S.E.C. has been taking this exceptionally seriously, and the regulations show that they want to make this market work,'' said Alon Hillel-Tuch, co-founder and chief financial officer at RocketHub, a crowdfunding site that plans to become a securities portal. ''The S.E.C. had an opportunity to go in the opposite direction, and put in significant hurdles that would have prevented this market from existing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span>, said the new rules on investment limits fell short of protecting investors. ''There's no real effort to ensure that intermediaries verify the income, the net worth or the compliance with aggregate investment limits,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Roper did note the rules would require companies selling stock to make some disclosures about risk factors and debt that were not explicitly required in the original JOBS Act. And, she said, the commission ''resisted a lot of bad suggestions,'' including calls from the industry to loosen or remove a requirement that companies seeking more than $500,000 release audited financial statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act established the financing portals as an alternative to traditional brokerages, which can also set up Web sites to sell crowdfunded securities. (None of the national retail brokerages have so far indicated an interest in doing so.) Financing portals were not meant to face as much scrutiny as brokers, but they also are not allowed to offer all of the same services. They are barred, for example, from providing investment advice or handling investor money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the regulations prescribe an intensive registration process for the portals, handled by both the S.E.C. and the <span class="companylink">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</span>, Wall Street's self-policing body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the days after the rules were released, few people had fully absorbed them. Ryan Feit, a founder of the securities crowdfunding portal SeedInvest, did raise concerns about audit and disclosure requirements for issuers, and the inability of portals to provide investment advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SeedInvest was among the platforms that waded into the private placement pool. Now Mr. Feit is not sure whether SeedInvest will return to crowdfunding or stay in private placements, or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could go either way,'' he said. ''A lot of it depends on what I read in the next day or so.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding is becoming a reality, but the question is whether it will thrive or become largely a vehicle for fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it does turn out to be a disaster, don't blame the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. The agency was merely following orders when it was told to adopt rules for crowdfunding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the regulator proposed rules governing crowdfunding in a 568-page release. The idea behind the proposal -- mandated by the 2012 Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act, or JOBS Act -- is born of our penchant for the kinds of popular ideas that emerge at TED talks. In the case of crowdfunding, the concept is that small companies can obtain the financing they need through the ''wisdom of crowds.'' The crowd in this instance will use the Internet to collectively pick the best investment. It is a win for all involved, particularly small companies that are starved for financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons to be skeptical, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, the experts in investing in start-ups -- venture capitalists -- are not terribly successful. According to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>, 40 percent of venture capital investments fail, 40 percent break about even and only 20 percent have a decent to high return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding investors, that is, you or me, are likely to lack the diversification of venture capitalists, meaning that crowdfunding investors will not have the successes to even out the overwhelming majority of failures. Moreover, the crowd's ability to pick winners may not be as good as the venture capitalists, meaning an even higher rate of failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the second problem associated with crowdfunding: fraud. Without proper identification, anyone can put a nifty sounding idea out there: Elaine from ''Seinfeld'' was right; we need to bring back the sponge! Or how about brushless toothbrushes! In the worst situation, the entrepreneur could take the money and run. Even without outright fraud, once the money comes in, there is no oversight. So entrepreneurs can fritter it away on their own expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a recent campaign on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site where companies raise money in exchange for products or services instead of shares. Some people compare the crowdfunding process of raising capital to what goes on at Kickstarter. In this case, an entrepreneur raised more than $122,000 on Kickstarter, preselling versions of a board game, the Doom that Came to Atlantic City, termed ''a Lovecraftian game of urban destruction.'' Months later, the entrepreneur canceled the project, having spent the money on things like moving to Portland, Ore. Atlantic City survived, and the only thing destroyed was the crowd's money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With crowdfunding, even if a company were successful, there is probably no way to exit or even control the company. As the S.E.C. acknowledged in its release last week, these companies are extremely unlikely to go public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all means that you will have better odds at the casino than investing in crowdfunded companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Congress was considering the JOBS Act, the legislation that made crowdfunding possible, the S.E.C. was strongly opposed. Mary L. Schapiro, then the chairwoman of the agency, said that the law would ''weaken important protection'' for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress largely ignored those concerns and dumped the rule-making for crowdfunding in the lap of the S.E.C. So the regulator has swallowed hard and tried to make the best of this situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C. did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final rules are a reflection of Congress and another force -- Eugene Scalia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scalia, a partner at the law firm of <span class="companylink">Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher</span>, has made a successful practice of challenging S.E.C. rules in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. His most prominent success so far has been persuading the court to overturn the agency's rules that would permit shareholders to nominate directors directly, known as proxy access. The court found that the S.E.C.'s cost-benefit analysis of the proxy access was so poor as to be arbitrary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision has given ammunition to opponents of the agency to challenge every rule as arbitrary. Because the court implied the need for statistical proof to justify a rule, it has set a high bar for the S.E.C. to overcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision has also had some unfortunate and unintended side effects. The lengthy release on its crowdfunding rules is a product of the S.E.C.'s attempt to meet the appellate court's challenge. The result is not better analysis, but rather simply more words on the page as the agency strains to justify every decision to show it has proper empirical proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court opinion has also led the commission to adopt a bunker mentality. Rather than risk yet another rule being overturned, the S.E.C. has instead preferred to adhere to the most conservative view of Congress's dictates. The result has been less innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of crowdfunding, the agency largely parroted what Congress did without addressing its own concerns about investor safety. That would be a problem in any circumstance, yet Congress adopted these rules without any real thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The JOBS Act raced through Congress and was initially supposed to be about reviving the market for initial public offerings. But forces in favor of private markets pushed for a new section to permit crowdfunding. This was never intended to be included by the group of venture capitalists and other industry groups who first proposed the JOBS Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of concerns about the potential for fraud in crowdfunding, new provisions were added to the legislation that required that crowdfunding be done through third-party portals or brokers. In addition, requirements for financial statements for companies and background checks on executives were added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Congress required that if more than $100,000 were raised, then the company's financial statements must be reviewed by an independent accountant. If the amount were more than $500,000, then the financial statements must be audited. Most companies will probably sidestep this requirement by raising less than $100,000. This means that small companies will predominate and the chance of fraud will only increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding could have been a chance to experiment, to try different ways to see which method raised capital best for companies with a minimal amount of fraud. The S.E.C. could have started by creating different markets with different rules. Or perhaps investing could have been done through funds that allow for diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, because of Congress's straitjacket and the S.E.C.'s fear of innovation, we have a proposal that seems likely to have significant problems, if not with fraud than simply with how investors will get their money back, let alone make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules are merely proposals, and comments are due in 90 days. The agency made almost 300 requests for comment on various issues. But the rules are unlikely to change much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C. has resisted crowdfunding and might not have ever gone along with any effort to endorse the practice. But the agency is hamstrung, afraid to do what it could have to make crowdfunding work better for investors. That's a shame generally, but maybe more so for the people who invest in these small companies and lose everything.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architect of a recent legal crackdown on Wall Street's dubious mortgage practices was not the attorney general, a United States attorney or a rising star in the Justice Department. Instead, it was Leon W. Weidman, an unassuming 69-year-old career prosecutor, toiling away in anonymity 3,000 miles from Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of his 43 years as a government lawyer, Mr. Weidman led a small group of federal prosecutors in Los Angeles. In the 1990s and 2000s, he and his team brought nearly 200 civil fraud lawsuits against two-bit mortgage crooks and small-business cheats, using an obscure federal law created in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis a quarter century ago.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the work of Mr. Weidman, a onetime engineer who earned his law degree at night, has leapt to a bigger stage: the government's campaign to punish Wall Street for the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His pioneering use of the law -- the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, or Firrea -- underpinned the Justice Department's tentative $13 billion settlement with <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>. The United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, has deployed the statute most often, filing civil fraud actions against <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, BNY Mellon and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, among others. A jury found <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> liable in that case last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wave of cases has ignited a legal controversy, raising the question of whether federal prosecutors, in dusting off an old statute, are misapplying the law. So far, judges have blessed the government's tactics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been an extremely effective tool,'' said Mr. Weidman, who lives in West Los Angeles with his wife, an artist, and their 95-pound Labradoodle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Weidman, who is known as Lee, sought to play down his role, numerous senior Justice Department officials singled him out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't emphasize enough how significant Lee was to these lawsuits,'' said Thomas J. Perrelli, a partner at Jenner &amp; Block who was the associate attorney general overseeing many of these cases. ''He was the one person who developed the theory that laid the foundation for the financial crisis cases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidman's work came into focus in 2009 with the economy reeling and the Obama administration under fire for not holding Wall Street banks accountable. As the Justice Department searched for new prosecutorial methods, Mr. Weidman became an overnight sensation within the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal prosecutors flew out to California to pick his brain. He held training sessions across the country. The Justice Department assigned him to one of its most promising investigations, a civil action against the credit-rating agency <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That case hinged on Firrea. Enacted in the late 1980s after risky lending practices imperiled the savings and loan industry, the law created a powerful tool to punish fraud committed by banks and their executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firrea is unusually crafted, as it requires a criminal violation like wire fraud or mail fraud to set off the law's penalties. But because it is a civil statute, it requires a lower burden of proof than criminal charges -- finding guilt by a preponderance of the evidence versus beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That broad authority has alarmed some defense lawyers, who have argued that the Justice Department has stretched the application of Firrea far beyond its original intent. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, in a motion to dismiss its case, described the prosecution as having ''a wildly expansive reading'' of the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other critics question whether the government is overcompensating for the lack of criminal cases against Wall Street. Firrea's civil actions are a cop-out, the critics say, since not one senior Wall Street executive has been charged criminally for a role in the crisis. The same office that employs Mr. Weidman -- the United States attorney's office in Los Angeles -- has come under fire for dropping a criminal investigation of Angelo Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, one of the biggest mortgage lenders before the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investigators at the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, which file civil cases against big banks, have also raised objections. Federal prosecutors, the S.E.C. officials privately grouse, are encroaching on their turf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Realistically, for the Justice Department, the civil cases are a Plan B,'' said Stavros Gadinis, a professor at the University of California, Berkley, law school who focuses on financial regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government's deployment of the little-used law has inspired comparisons to Eliot Spitzer's novel use of the Martin Act as a cudgel against fraud. As New York's attorney general, Mr. Spitzer harnessed the powerful 1921 state law to pursue suspected wrongdoing at large Wall Street firms like <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firrea carries similar potency. In addition to the lower burden of proof, it allows prosecutors to bring cases that take aim at misconduct as far back as 10 years -- a generous statute of limitations compared with five years for criminal securities fraud. And in pursuing a Firrea lawsuit, prosecutors are allowed not only to issue subpoenas, but also to take the sworn testimony of individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also provides for hefty fines. The Justice Department used the law to sue S.&amp; P. for more than $5 billion, accusing it of knowingly issuing misleading ratings on mortgage-backed securities. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>'s tentative $13 billion settlement over its sale of shoddy mortgage securities would be a record -- a single company has never before paid that much to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defense lawyers say that Firrea gives the government a game-changing weapon in pursuing civil cases against banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In retrospect, it's surprising that prosecutors have waited so long to happen upon such a powerful statute,'' said Susan E. Brune, a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at Brune &amp; Richard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidman discovered Firrea in the early 1990s while thumbing through materials in his office's law library. He briefly formed a ''Firrea unit,'' but disbanded it when the caseload sank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial crisis ignited new interest in the law. With criminal investigations of banks facing an uncertain future, the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., instructed Tony West, who at the time ran the Justice Department's civil division in Washington, to pursue his own cases. Mr. Perrelli, then a top government lawyer, thought of Mr. Weidman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a legal conference in South Carolina, Mr. West and Mr. Weidman met to discuss Firrea. Soon after, in late 2009, the Justice Department issued a subpoena to S.&amp;. P. based on Firrea. And in May 2010, one official said, Mr. West circulated a three-page memo to every United States attorney in the country, urging broader use of Firrea. Citing the ''potential deterrent effect,'' Mr. West outlined the Justice Department's ''guidelines for approval'' of cases under Firrea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same month, the Justice Department published a ''white paper'' by Mr. Weidman explaining Firrea's benefits. He noted that the number of reported mortgage frauds had been growing astronomically, rising more than 272 percent from 2004 to 2008, citing an F.B.I. report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lectures, Mr. Weidman reminded prosecutors that banks, unlike people, cannot go to jail. Flashing a picture of Alcatraz prison, and noting that a company could never land there, Mr. Weidman argued that Firrea and its fines were the strongest tool at the government's disposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal prosecutors in Manhattan were among the first to seize on Mr. Weidman's work. In 2009, Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, made it a priority to beef up his office's civil division. He recruited Andrew W. Schilling, a former prosecutor who had left for private practice, to return to government and run the unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office soon sent several prosecutors on a fact-finding mission to Los Angeles, where they met with Mr. Weidman to discuss the law. As they learned more, they decided to put Firrea to work on a grander scale, using it to bring cases against some of the country's largest banks, including <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, BNY Mellon and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one had ever brought cases like this before, but no one had ever seen conduct like this before,'' Mr. Bharara said in a recent interview at his office in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have challenged the government's cases, but at least four federal judges have denied the banks' motions to dismiss these cases, lending credibility to Mr. Weidman's strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Chicago, Mr. Weidman received his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of California, Los Angeles. He then moved to Pittsburgh, where he worked as a project engineer for Westinghouse's nuclear division and earned his law degree from <span class="companylink">Duquesne University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weidman joined the Justice Department in Philadelphia straight out of law school and moved to Los Angeles a few years later, working on antitrust and white collar fraud cases before being named head of the office's civil division in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era when lawyers routinely shuttle between the Justice Department and lucrative law firm partnerships, Mr. Weidman is something of a relic. Earning a government salary of $155,000 a year, he says he has no plans to spin his recent success into a seven-figure salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not going anywhere,'' he said. ''There's plenty of work left to do.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, normalcy has nearly returned to Istanbul Restaurant, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. But in the days after Hurricane Sandy laid waste to the New York coastline, Riza Atas thought he had been washed out of business. His Turkish restaurant, a neighborhood fixture for 17 years, had been all but destroyed. His tables and chairs wound up down the block. His landlord hauled 30 containers of garbage out of the deluged basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the first month, we don't talk, we don't think. We just sit down and watch,'' he said. ''Then little by little, we started to talk to friends, to the building owner, to see what could be done here.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once he resolved to rebuild, however, Mr. Atas concluded that he was going to have to do most of it without institutional support. ''We had insurance, but we didn't have flood insurance -- and if you don't have flood insurance, you don't get nothing,'' he said. Employees from the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> came by. They promised grants, he said, but nothing came of it. ''They forget everything, they don't do anything -- just talk,'' he said. It was the same with the city, he said. ''They accept our application, but they don't send any mail, they don't call us. If they give us a $5,000 grant, we'd still accept, but we don't get any penny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesperson from the City's Department of Small Business Services said that agency does not have a completed application from Mr. Atas. But, the spokesperson added, ''loans and grants are still available, and we encourage businesses to work with our NYC Business Solutions Centers to make the application process as easy as possible.'' The city has distributed $20 million in loans and grants to small businesses affected by Sandy. A FEMA spokesman said that while the agency could not comment specifically on Mr. Atas's case, it normally sends small businesses to the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>, which makes reconstruction loans directly to home and business owners after a disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Atas did apply for help from the S.B.A., he said, but to no avail. ''They want a lot of paperwork. A lot of questions, they ask,'' he said. ''Then they say, my credit is not enough, they can't pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, Mr. Atas found financing from a handful of friends in the United States and family members back in Turkey. At that point, he said, ''I know I can finish this. All the customers, they come and ask if they can help -- I say, 'No thanks, everything's O.K.' And I start to feel good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, he still had to wait, first for the building's landlord -- who did have flood insurance -- to get reimbursed before work could begin. Then he had to wait for the power company to install new meters and an electrical box and for gas to be restored. It was not until February, he said, that he could begin to reconstruct his restaurant. In the meantime, he was unable to hold on to his 10 employees, who left for work elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, Mr. Atas had thought he could do the job for about $200,000, including a new basement and a new kitchen. But he quickly learned that the city would require wholesale reconstruction of the first floor: new floors, new walls, and a new ceiling. And he decided to renovate in style. He traveled to Turkey, and came back with 50 antique Ottoman-style light fixtures, fabric for the chairs and banquettes, and artwork for the walls, which he designed to look like the front of a Turkish house. ''I don't want it to be outside Istanbul, inside Paris,'' he said. ''I wanted outside and inside Istanbul, where you come and you feel like you are in Turkey. It's like a museum, much better than it was before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took about four months to restore the restaurant, and the cost came to more than $300,000. But Mr. Atas got more help along the way. Both his carpenter and his electrician were friends, he said, and they gave him time to pay them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early June, Istanbul Restaurant reopened, with Turkish folk musicians playing on the sidewalk. More than 100 longtime customers showed up -- as did Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, along with representatives from the Turkish consulate. Business, Mr. Atas said, is better than before. ''Some customers come three or four times a week,'' he said. ''They come to eat, but they try to help us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building that houses Istanbul Restaurant is still ringed in scaffolding -- it required repairs to the facade and the roof -- but that will start to come down next week, Mr. Atas said, and the last visible scar of Hurricane Sandy will recede. Mr. Atas is optimistic about his restaurant's future, as if its stature in the Brooklyn and Turkish communities alone can protect it. ''This place is not only a restaurant,'' he said, ''it's also a Turkish cultural center. The Turkish president, the Turkish Parliament, whenever they come to the United States, they come here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the prospect of another hurricane, Mr. Atas simply hopes for the best. Sheepshead Bay is still directly across the street, and he still has no flood insurance because, he said, his longtime insurance broker told him that his insurance company no longer offers it. (In fact, the federal government offers flood insurance to anyone who needs it through the National Flood Insurance Program.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tomorrow will come no matter what, so what can we do?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A television mounted high on a living room wall escaped the rushing waters from the St. Vrain Creek. But most of their furniture and appliances were buried in piles of mud. The presses, which Mr. Collins used to run his thriving T-shirt screening business from the back of the rented house, were smashed to pieces.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no going back for us,'' said Mr. Collins, 44, now living with friends in nearby Longmont. ''But we are restarting the business even though we are starting everything from zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no flood insurance, and limited access to credit and small business loans, Mr. Collins turned to online charitable giving -- a crowdfunding platform called GoFundMe -- to help raise money to regain his footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two months since the floods, GoFundMe has helped him generate more than $8,000 in donations from 70 people. Combined with money from the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> for flood damage, Mr. Collins said he had enough to rent space in Longmont with a partner and order a new press and supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of them are family and friends,'' Mr. Collins said of the donors. ''Most of the donations, probably half of them, are from clients who want me to go, go, go. About a quarter of them are from complete strangers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter, the world's largest crowdfunding platform, began in 2009 as a way for people to contribute, mostly for arts and other creative projects. Indiegogo was begun in 2008, initially to find funding for independent films but later joining other online platforms that offer a wide array of projects as varied as school field trips and global clean water initiatives. Nonprofit organizations like the <span class="companylink">American Red Cross</span> have used Crowdrise and other online charitable giving platforms to raise funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, people are increasingly turning to crowdfunding and their personal online social networks to raise money not only after disasters but also to help cover medical bills and expenses arising from job loss or other challenging events. GoFundMe collects donations with credit and debit cards and passes them on to the beneficiaries after taking a 7.9 percent fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Damphousse, chief executive and co-founder of GoFundMe, said Hurricane Sandy last fall was the first national disaster for which he saw a spike in people using the platform to help one another out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is changing the way we give,'' he said. ''When people have the option to give to someone in a very targeted way and give to someone they know, love and care about, they are going to choose that path over a traditional charity or nonprofit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About $1.3 million was raised that way after Hurricane Sandy, he said. Victims of the Boston Marathon bombings, mostly seeking help for medical expenses, raised $3.4 million using crowdfunding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allison Fine, a co-author of ''The Networked Nonprofit: Connecting With Social Media to Drive Change,'' said crowdfunding helped people support one another directly in a time of need. ''Instead of everyone gathering to raise a barn,'' Ms. Fine said, ''they can now give money directly after something happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is suggesting, however, that crowdfunding platforms will replace the fund-raising might or relief efforts of the <span class="companylink">American Red Cross</span>, United Way and other large, traditional charitable organizations. The Red Cross estimated that as of Oct. 30 it had received $5.6 million in donations and pledges for Colorado flood aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Elwood, vice president for consumer marketing and fund-raising for the <span class="companylink">American Red Cross</span>, said she did not view the online efforts as competition. ''We have a completely new audience of people who care about the mission but are looking to help in a way that is relevant to them,'' Ms. Elwood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boulder, Matt and Leah Kaplan have raised more than $24,000 from 129 donors with GoFundMe since the floodwaters roared down the mountain, blew out their back door and destroyed almost everything on the first floor of their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplan said he and his wife were initially reluctant when a family member offered to set up a page on their behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought it was a little weird asking people for money,'' said Mr. Kaplan, 44, a sales director for an outdoor-shoe company. ''But so many old friends across the country were asking how they could help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without flood insurance, funds from FEMA were not enough to cover the cost of the cleanup, remodeling and lost appliances and furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We decided to give it a try, and we were just absolutely shocked at the support, the caring and the way that people just rallied to help us,'' Mr. Kaplan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Collins also said he was stunned by the outpouring of support he received to help him restart his T-shirt business, which he is now calling Phoenix Ink, to ''show everyone we will always rise above the ashes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a sales representative and the chief executive of Ryonet Corporation, a printing press manufacturer, learned that Mr. Collins, a longtime customer, was struggling after the floods, the company offered him discounted pricing and free shipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both men also personally contributed to Mr. Collins on GoFundMe. ''Not a huge one,'' said Ryan Moor, the chief executive, ''but something to help him out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 9, 2013, Saturday</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span> chose the three because they represented prominent users of the micro-messaging service. There was Patrick Stewart, the actor of ''Star Trek'' fame, and Cheryl Fiandaca, the spokeswoman for the Boston Police Department. But the third, a 9-year-old girl in a blue princess dress, was the revolutionary in the group, one who may change the way nonprofits and perhaps even companies, are run.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is Vivienne Harr. When she was 8, her parents showed her a picture by the photographer Lisa Kristine of two young Nepalese boys hauling huge rocks on their heads down a mountain. The boys were holding hands for comfort. The quarry was filled with child slaves who were forced to undertake this task every day. Vivienne, who often wears princess dresses, started a lemonade stand to raise money to end child slavery with the goal of raising $100,000 by selling lemonade for a year. By day 173, she hit her mark, donating $101,320 to the charity Not for Sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivienne's success was spurred by a heart-rending cause, a cute face and a good tagline in the form of ''make a stand.'' But she would most likely have just been another lemonade stand if not for her father, a social media expert. Eric Harr was president at the time of Resonate Social, and his clients included CBS News and Lexus, among others. He led a media-savvy <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> campaign that attracted national attention for Vivienne's cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this feel-good story really interesting is what happened next. Instead of moving on, or even forming a nonprofit to continue those goals, Mr. Harr and his wife, as well as Vivienne, formed a business around this cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harr raised $982,000 in financing and incorporated Make a Stand. He quit his job and is now the chief executive. Make a Stand sells fair-trade, organic lemonade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is not all about profit. The Harrs took advantage of new laws adopted by the State of Washington that created a type of corporate entity called a special purpose corporation, which is intended to earn a profit for shareholders, but can take into account other social constituencies, such as a charity. Armed with venture capital, Vivienne has set out to conquer the lemonade business and end child slavery. Make a Stand will give 5 percent of its revenue to five charities to combat child slavery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company makes no profit now, but according to Mr. Harr, when it does, it will consider giving a portion to its cause, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you look at the company's website or product, there is no doubt that the charitable mission is the sales pitch. Make a Stand may be selling delicious lemonade, but the hook to getting people to buy it and setting the company apart is the worthy cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lemonade sold online at the company's website has no set price -- customers are asked to pay what they want. This is pure marketing genius as it also builds on the premise of donating and generosity on which charities thrive. In the words of Mr. Harr, ''no one ever pays less'' because of the cause. People don't just want a product these days, they want a cause, and Make a Stand delivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, 128 stores have agreed to sell Make a Stand's lemonade, and there are big hopes to go national.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make a Stand may not just be a new form of charity, but perhaps something else; a transformation of the corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More a third of states have passed some type of legislation allowing for hybrid corporations, companies that do not have shareholder profits as their primary goal. Instead, these companies can be run for social purposes with some of the money going to social and charitable causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of these social benefit companies is not a utopian pipe dream. Real companies have now become quasi-profit companies, including most prominently the outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia, which is now a California benefit corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, there are problems with this innovative corporate form. The first of these is determining who the company is going to benefit. Even if there is a clear beneficiary, there could be ''greenwashing,'' when companies put on a charitable or social face, but the real money flows to the people who run the company. This is a particular issue because disclosure requirements and other standards that typically apply to charitable giving do not always apply to these companies. There is often no third-party monitor to ensure that the benefit corporation actually benefits its causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Make a Stand's case, it also raises a more difficult issue. If the company is successful and indeed does raise millions in profits to end child slavery, it will also make millions for its founders. This runs counter to the view that people shouldn't profit unduly from these causes. After all, if Newman's Own, started by Paul Newman, could raise $370 million as a nonprofit, why should you need a profit for the people who run the company?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is one of the hottest topics among charities these days, an issue driven by Dan Pallotta's TED Talk a few years ago. In that talk, Mr. Pallotta argued that charities should not be rewarded for how little they spend on themselves and that it is better to reward the people at these charities for doing good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise of Make a Stand is merging the idea of the quasi-public company that pays its investors and rewards the people who run charities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make a Stand may be at the vanguard of a new crop of companies that are charitable but not nonprofits, or even more radically, for-profit but socially motivated. These quasi-companies make money for both a cause and its founders. The hope is that even after splitting profits with investors, Make a Stand and these other companies will still raise more than an ordinary nonprofit. Charitable giving in the United States hovers at 2 percent of gross domestic product, or about $316 billion. There is room to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new entities can raise more money, but will they be able to avoid the potential problem with this unsupervised form of business and social causes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I spoke to Mr. Harr, he acknowledged that the company's status was ''liberating but a little bit complicated'' and that he had to ''explain it.'' He also said that he could ''hire epic people who can move mountains and take calculated risks,'' like an ad campaign with <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harr emphasized that Make a Stand strove to be as transparent as a nonprofit. The company has a whole section on its website about transparency, along with a promise to publish its financials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only that, but if you speak to Mr. Harr, you get the idea this is not a charity but a start-up like any other in Silicon Valley. The mantra is to increase revenue, which, in the case of Make a Stand, is expected to be more than $2 million next year. The executives, including Mr. Harr, do not take a salary for now. Entrepreneurs do this all the time, but nonprofit executives?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether Make a Stand uses this new corporate form to succeed and make more than it could for its cause than as a nonprofit. If done right, this could not just raise money to end child slavery, but perhaps create a role model for nonprofits and all types of businesses. Thanks in large part to <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conventional wisdom holds that some 90 percent of start-ups fail. After years of observation, Adeo Ressi -- a serial entrepreneur who founded TheFunded.com, an online community where entrepreneurs rate investors; Methodfive, a website developer; and Total New York, which became AOL Digital Cities -- concluded that the high failure rate was the result of the wrong people starting businesses and not getting the right training.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Mr. Ressi started the Founder Institute to teach the basics. Unlike other incubators, the Founder Institute doesn't take students who already have a company. Instead, applicants are chosen through a personality test. Those accepted learn the process and develop their ideas through h a mixture of workshops and what might be called entrepreneurial immersion. The program has opened in 60 cities around the world and charges a sliding scale, from nothing at a Johannesburg scholarship program to about $1,000 in the United States. It also takes a 3.5 percent stake in the companies started by its students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conversation that has been condensed and edited, Mr. Ressi, 41, said that more than 1,000 companies had come out of the program, which he said had flipped the failure rate to 10 percent from 90 percent and created 10,000 jobs. His goal is to create 20,000 jobs a year by 2020 and to ''globalize Silicon Valley.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You try to identify potential entrepreneurs through personality testing. What do you look for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There are a number of traits that combine to create entrepreneurial potential. We find that openness coordinates very well with successful entrepreneurs. The more open-minded you are, the more you see the world as it actually is. The more closed-minded, the more you see the world as you want it to be. An open-minded person running a business might catch a problem faster than a closed-minded person. And when they identify a problem they can fix it much faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. In comparing yourself to start-up accelerators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups, you have said that while they make jewelry, you mine diamonds. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The Founder Institute takes people right when they are taking the first steps to launching a business. We help them launch the business and become full-time entrepreneurs. Most other programs take founders who have already established companies. The inputs to most incubators today are the output of the Founder Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Why start prelaunch?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Because we're dealing with people at the point of inception, we can help them avoid mistakes before they are made. Start-ups often die in the first 18 to 24 months because of formative mistakes, like choosing a bad co-founder or the wrong corporate entity or an inappropriate platform. Ninety percent of the companies the Founder Institute has created are alive because we've helped them avoid those mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Ninety percent? Really?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We've recently helped launch our thousandth company and about 10 percent -- 116 -- are dead. Another 15 percent -- 146 -- are hibernating or being run by people still at their day job. The 75 percent of our businesses that aren't dead or hibernating are producing jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Once you have identified likely entrepreneurs, what do you teach them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Our role is not to teach them but to condition someone who has the traits to become a successful entrepreneur. We essentially give them the types of work that an entrepreneur would do and we put them in the kinds of situations that an entrepreneur would find himself in. And we increase the intensity over time and manage that transformation from an employee to an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How do you do that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A lot of times a company's initial employees are a very interesting and diverse group of people. We try to replicate what a founding team would look like and we place these entrepreneurs in those founding team environments. We create working groups with four or five peers, and they meet multiple times per week to discuss their progress in building their business. These groups act like a founding team because they help one another build their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. When you say employees can be interesting and diverse, do you mean difficult and contentious?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There is a saying in entrepreneurship that your early employees are all commandos. Commandos are people who can do almost everything well: emails, strategy, code, design. Founders are also often commandos. So these working groups resemble closely what your company will look like over the first 16 to 24 months of existence. Are they super easy to deal with and friendly? No. They are usually supersmart and hardworking, and they usually don't suffer fools very well. So you have to manage your working group like you'll manage your early employees and that's not going to be easy. But if you don't have experience doing it, you're going to fail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You also have C.E.O. mentors teach subject workshops. How did you develop your curriculum?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I asked members of TheFunded.com, who are all C.E.O.'s, to give me some feedback. About 2,000 C.E.O.'s participated. Then we logically arranged those topics, and that became the first curriculum. When we ran that curriculum, we realized there was a lot of duplication in it, so we ended up merging a bunch of topics and that became version 2.0. In version 3.0, we modernized the curriculum. A few years ago, social media wasn't critical to your success but today you really need to factor it in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. There's got to be a downside to working with pre-company entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The downside is that the commitment level in someone quitting their job and starting a company is low, even when they say they are 100 percent committed. When you push them, they quit entrepreneurship. So we have a number of strategic inflection points that make founders in the program decide if they really want to be an entrepreneur. As a result, we see that 65 percent of those who start the program drop out and go back to their previous lifestyle. You have to kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What happens to the 65 percent who drop out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. For some, the entrepreneurial lifestyle is too much of a sacrifice or others don't have a good idea they're passionate about. It's not like they're dropping out and saying, 'The program is terrible. I'm going to start my own company.' The vast majority go back to the corporate world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You've launched in 60 cities, many of them in nontraditional entrepreneurial environments like Colombia and Vietnam and Saudi Arabia. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're not a money-driven organization. We're mission-driven. I firmly believe that 2 percent of the population has the ''entrepreneurial genes,'' and I believe it's our mission to help them launch meaningful and enduring technology companies, wherever they are. If it's on an island off the coast of Sumatra or in Riyadh or Santiago de Chile, if we can help them achieve their dream, we'll do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How's Riyadh doing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Riyadh's not a good example because we haven't launched there yet. It's very hard because we're trying to let women in the program, which is creating setbacks for us. But we're working on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What percentage of your participants are women?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Thirty-six percent of our graduates are female, up from 14 percent when we started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How much do you adapt your program to individual countries?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Zero. We translate it. We're in a lot of languages. But we don't localize the program. Because the program is the same everywhere, a graduate in Vietnam or Colombia or South Africa is the same quality as someone in Silicon Valley. But the pool of entrepreneurs in that culture is of much lower quality, so they are exceptional there. Companies that come out of these foreign markets dominate their local markets.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's main economic engine -- small and medium-size businesses -- desperately needs attention if the Continent's nascent recovery is to gain momentum. To provide a boost, policy makers and the private sector must resolve the systemic problems that impede the flow of information, limit access to capital, and contribute to burdensome regulations that stifle growth and employment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In France, for example, there are roughly 60 percent fewer companies with 50 employees than with 49 employees. Why? All things being equal, you would expect a normal distribution of companies by employee size, with no significant difference in the number of firms with 48 employees, 49 or 50. But, because of the regulations triggered by reaching 50 employees, a huge number of businesses deliberately do not exceed 49. Adding one more job involves coping with 34 more regulatory requirements -- such as creation of a works council, a hygiene and security committee, and mandatory profit-sharing. That raises a company's costs by the equivalent of 4 percent, on average, of total payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small and medium enterprises, or SMEs, provide two of every three jobs in Europe and account for 58 percent of business activity. They range from tiny startups to small family-run firms to medium-size concerns supplying major manufacturers. For Europe to fully recover, policy makers need to understand what is blocking financing to such enterprises, find solutions and quickly implement them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the size of the challenge: New bank lending to small and medium enterprises in the euro zone as a whole (using loans of less than €1 million as a gauge) has declined by 36 percent since the April 2008 peak. This falloff was steepest from 2008 to 2010, but the decline has continued since 2010. With a heavy dependence on domestic markets, these businesses have been coping with a sharp slide in demand from consumers, other firms and governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To gain a clearer picture of what's hindering this critical sector, the Institute of International Finance and <span class="companylink">Bain &amp; Co</span>. conducted more than 140 interviews with a broad cross-section of small business associations, bankers, venture capitalists, academics and public officials in France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, and at the European level. What emerged are four major sets of impediments to financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first is the lack of easy access to low-cost information about creditworthiness. Such information often resides in too many places; Ireland and the Netherlands, for example, have no credit registry run by a central bank that would allow other banks to check their own exposure against a small firm's outstanding aggregate debt. Other regulations actually prevent the easy sharing of information to those that need it most. In Portugal, restrictions on accessing historical information about potential new clients hamper the ability of banks and investors to judge risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second impediment consists of tax, legal and regulatory disincentives that hinder SMEs from achieving greater scale and financial health. That, in turn, limits their creditworthiness, because smaller firms are more susceptible to economic swings than larger ones. In Spain, for example, auditing regulations unintentionally stifle growth, notably through a requirement to have an external audit when a firm reaches annual revenues of €6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third and fourth impediments prevent banks and alternative sources of financing from fully serving demand, especially once European growth accelerates. Banks now can shoulder less credit risk than before the crisis, and they're in the midst of significant deleveraging. Even so, better credit guarantees and broader use of credit insurance could spur more lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond banks, some countries lack the funding sources that firms should be able to tap at different stages of maturity, whether they are high-potential startups or firms that need to restructure. Britain and Italy have comparable populations and economic output, but British venture capital and private equity firms provide 20 times more funding than their Italian counterparts. Italy and other countries where small firms play a more prominent role, like Portugal, Greece and Spain, also suffer from weak supporting ecosystems of legal, accounting and regulatory participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many initiatives throughout Europe have begun to help reduce these impediments. We found, however, that a best practice in one country was not necessarily well-known elsewhere. For instance, Standard Business Reporting, or SBR, a common, simple, digital language for business-to-government reporting, has worked well in the Netherlands since 2008. It allows a Dutch firm to submit its financial accounts to tax authorities, business registers and banks as an input to credit applications. If adopted elsewhere, SBR could significantly reduce information costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France offers another example via the impressive central credit registry run by the <span class="companylink">Banque de France</span>, which also provides credit ratings on nearly 280,000 firms, most of them small and medium enterprises. Similar information in other countries could do a lot to lower the cost and improve the availability of information on creditworthiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We found equally promising initiatives in Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain involving credit guarantees, tax incentives for equity investments and bankruptcy restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how can each country address these impediments? Most of the effort should be led at the national level. The solutions will be complex and require coordination across different groups. We recommend the establishment of technocratic, nonpartisan national task forces with participants from small business, the public sector, banks and providers of alternative financing, so that each task force can craft solutions tailored to its national environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This process won't be easy, but we believe it can succeed. Most of the potential solutions have already shown promise in one country or another. During our interviews, we heard enthusiasm for learning about what works abroad and how it can be adapted at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe needs small and medium-sized businesses that are globally competitive, highly productive and able to seize the benefits of the single market. Focused national task forces and better sharing of innovative processes will get Europe on the path to stronger job creation and economic growth.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Wednesday announced a one-year delay in a major element of the new health care law that would allow small businesses to buy insurance online for their employees through the new federal marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was yet another setback for the rollout of the health care law and resulted, in part, from the well-documented problems of the insurance marketplace website. Administration officials said they had to focus on the basic functions of the website, so that individuals could shop for insurance, before offering online enrollment for small businesses. In the meantime, businesses and their employees can apply through brokers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many employees of small businesses are uninsured, and the businesses themselves are much less likely than big companies to provide coverage to workers and their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest delay, coming just as the White House was boasting of major improvements in the health insurance website, HealthCare.gov, opens the door to more complaints about the health care law and could increase pressure to delay other provisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The president bit off more than he can chew with this health care law, and small businesses are now forced to bear the consequences,'' said Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. ''Business owners across the country are already having health care plans for their employees canceled by this law, and now they're told they won't have access to the system the president promised them to find different coverage. Instead, they'll have to resort to a system you'd expect to see in the 1950s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not the first delay for small businesses. The administration had previously delayed online enrollment for them to the end of this month from Oct. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The date has now been pushed back to November 2014 for coverage that takes effect in January 2015, according to the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement, just before Thanksgiving, was reminiscent of the way the White House announced, just before the Fourth of July weekend, a one-year delay in the requirement for larger employers to offer health insurance to employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketplace for small businesses -- the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP exchange -- was one of the few provisions of the 2010 law with some Republican support, and it was originally championed by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John C. Arensmeyer, the chief executive of Small Business Majority, an advocacy group that supports the health care law, said, ''It's disappointing that the online portion of the federal small business marketplace through Healthcare.gov will be delayed, and it's important it get up and running as soon as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketplace, he said, ''is still the most important provision in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, small businesses have had difficulty getting affordable insurance. Many owners cite the rising cost of health insurance as their top concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration said that small businesses and their employees seeking coverage in the federal exchange could still apply and enroll through an agent or broker, as many do now. ''Agents and brokers are essential to making this happen,'' an administration official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the high-tech capability once promised by the White House will not be available until late next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The agent, broker or insurer will help the employer fill out a paper application for SHOP eligibility and send it in to the SHOP marketplace,'' the administration said. The insurer can also tell employers what premiums they would have to pay and can enroll employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some small businesses may qualify for tax credits worth up to 50 percent of their premium costs. The tax credits will be available only for plans purchased through the small business exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda L. Austin, a lobbyist at the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, a trade group, said she had heard rumors that the online small business exchange might be delayed, but was surprised that it had been put off for a year. ''That's pretty significant,'' Ms. Austin said. ''The online exchange is a key component of the Affordable Care Act, and administration officials have hailed it as the answer to small businesses' health care concerns.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the online exchange is being delayed, she said, ''many small businesses face higher premiums in 2014 because of new taxes, including a new federal tax on the health insurance they purchase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that the website was ''vastly improved each and every day,'' with hardware upgrades and software fixes that produced lower error rates and faster response times for users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An employer using the SHOP exchange must offer coverage to all full-time employees -- generally those working at least 30 hours a week, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the Obama administration delayed a requirement that SHOP exchanges offer a variety of competing insurance plans to employees. The administration cited ''operational challenges'' as a reason for that delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress had wanted to provide small business employees with a range of health plan options. While some state-run exchanges will allow employers to offer such choices to employees, the federal exchange will not do so until 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, said, ''If the law is so burdensome for the administration to implement, just think how hard it is for small businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate announcement, officials at the Health and Human Services Department said Wednesday that they would replace the contractor that manages computer servers handling the enormous load of data collected by HealthCare.gov.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terremark, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Verizon Communications</span> that now provides the service, will be replaced in March by <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, officials said. A spokeswoman at the <span class="companylink">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</span> said the change had been planned at least since July. Issues related to the raw computing capacity of the servers provided by Terremark have been cited as a factor in the website problems. A spokesman for Verizon declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems engulfing President Obama's health care law are remarkable because administration officials had repeatedly brushed aside doubts about whether they would be ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testifying before a congressional panel on Oct. 29, Marilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Medicare agency, said, in response to a question, that the website for the small business exchange would be in operation by the end of this month.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- With growth in Britain steaming ahead of its Continental rivals, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, claimed victory on Thursday over European critics of austerity budgets, and even balanced some small giveaways with promises of more harsh medicine to address weaknesses, insisting that the job of repairing the economy was far from complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite sharp, upward revisions of growth estimates, Mr. Osborne offered only small tax breaks to hard-pressed Britons -- like married couples and small businesses -- and even those were accompanied by a warning that workers would have to wait longer to retire.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His presentation -- an annual update to Parliament on the government's economic strategy, which was the most upbeat in years -- included a forecast that growth for all of 2013 would end up at a 1.4 percent annual rate, compared with an earlier estimate of 0.6 percent. He also predicted growth of 2.4 percent for next year, an improvement over an earlier 1.8 percent forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new estimates from the <span class="companylink">Office for Budget Responsibility</span>, which provides independent forecasts, make Britain one of the growth pacesetters among the large advanced economies. Also Thursday, the United States government said that the American economy had notched its best quarter since early 2012 and increased its estimate of growth in the third quarter, to a 3.6 percent annual rate from 2.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This good news contrasted with gloomier reports in parts of Europe. One indicator, a survey last month of purchasing managers published by the research firm Markit, said that France might slip back into recession, and that its jobless rate rose slightly in the third quarter to a more-than-16-year high of 10.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Osborne provided his economic assessment last year, many feared that Britain might slip back into recession. On Thursday he claimed credit for an unexpected surge in growth. But he also insisted that ''the job is not done'' -- an appeal to voters not to entrust his party's political opponents with stewardship of the economy after the next elections, in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We seek a responsible recovery,'' Mr. Osborne told Parliament, ''one where we don't squander the gains that we have made but go on taking the difficult decisions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other European governments may look in envy at British growth forecasts, analysts said Britain was risking an unbalanced recovery. Robert Wood, chief economist here for Britain at Berenberg, argued that one of the main reasons for the speed of the pickup was a more aggressive monetary policy and a consumer culture more reliant on credit than elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unlike in France, where you can only encourage people to borrow today if they think they can repay it tomorrow, the British consumer is not worried that much about the long term,'' Mr. Wood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government programs that made it easier to get credit over the last three years, and a banking sector that had cleaned itself of bad assets faster, helped the British economy push ahead of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, though, the stabilization of the euro zone, Britain's largest single export market, has helped the British recovery. Although British exports have failed to improve, greater stability in the euro zone made consumers in Britain more confident and eager to spend. Growing consumer confidence coupled with inflation that remained above the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s 2 percent target, meant that household savings fell and consumption increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate announcement on Thursday, Britain's central bank said that it would keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent and that it would maintain its program of economic stimulus at 375 billion pounds, or about $615 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne did deliver good news to some British voters, announcing plans to help married couples through a new tax allowance; drivers with a freeze on the taxes applied to fuel; and small businesses, whose local taxes will be curbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his statement was carefully balanced and laced with warnings that much more work needed to be done to secure a sustainable, long-term recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the squeeze on government spending will continue, with an additional £3 billion cut from government departmental budgets. And employees will have to work longer before they can claim state pensions. The government had planned to start raising the retirement age to 68 from 65 by 2046 to reflect improved life expectancy. But that switch will now be brought forward to the mid-2030s, then bumped up again, to 69, in the mid-2040s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's caution is partly political, because the statement Thursday represented an important point in the debate over economic strategy. Competing agendas will dominate the political landscape before the next general elections in Britain, which are due in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labour Party, which until recently had called on Mr. Osborne to change economic course and stimulate the economy, has switched tactics. It now highlights the fact that most Britons feel no better off and remain squeezed by low wage increases and soaring utility costs. That focus on the cost of living has put the government on the defensive, particularly on energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Osborne said that he would reduce the environmental levies the government assesses on energy bills, saving consumers around £50 a year on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking in Parliament, Labour's economy spokesman, Ed Balls, said there was ''a cost of living crisis'' and accused the chancellor of ''utterly breathtaking complacency.'' Labour argues that the recovery being constructed by the Conservative-led coalition will most likely benefit the wealthier. Mr. Osborne's message is that the opposition cannot be trusted to continue stabilizing the economy after the worst crash in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his statement, Mr. Osborne predicted that Britain would run a budget surplus by 2018-19, and announced a cap on business rates -- the taxes that companies pay on their properties to the local authorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But behind the good news on growth, big challenges remain amid worries that the recovery is being driven by housing price increases and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price rises, particularly in London and southeast England, have provoked concerns that Britain is about to begin its familiar cycle of economic boom and bust. Last week, the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> elected to refocus a £60 billion lending program away from the housing market and toward businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Osborne announced that nonresidents would have to pay tax on gains they make on property in Britain, a measure meant to deter foreign speculators, particularly in the most exclusive parts of London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, other fundamentals like productivity growth and exports remain disappointing, and ministers accept the need for better infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government, which cut back strongly on capital spending when it came to power in 2010, has begun to change course. This week, it announced plans to invest £375 billion in energy, transportation and communications networks. The plan involves selling the government's 40 percent stake in the Eurostar high-speed rail service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the length of the recession, Mr. Osborne's original plan for public finances has long been off course. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS in London, welcomed the news that Britain's net debt level is now expected to peak a year earlier and at a lower level than once expected. ''The government borrowing and debt forecasts are still horribly high,'' he said. ''But they do look an awful lot better than they did back in March.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Bourne, head of Economic Research at the Center for Policy Studies, a pro-free market research institute, said Britain was undergoing ''a cyclical upturn'' with forecasts showing that ''the underlying structural deficit will be higher as a proportion of G.D.P. in the next two years than forecast in the budget in March.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking in Parliament, Michael Meacher, a Labour lawmaker and former minister, reeled off a list of negative statistics, arguing that business investment remained 25 percent below the precrash level, that productivity was among the lowest in the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span>, that real wages had fallen 7 percent and that the deficit on traded goods was quite likely to exceed £100 billion this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How can the chancellor conceivably claim that this recovery is sustainable?'' Mr. Meacher asked.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONG BEACH, N.Y. -- For Kathryn Fitzgerald and her young daughter, Megan, home was a modest three-bedroom house here, on a tightly packed segment of Delaware Avenue two blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. That was the only home that Megan had ever known, until Hurricane Sandy hit and a rank mixture of floodwater and untreated sewage rose to chest-high in the lower level of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, they have lived in rental apartments and Megan, now 9, attended an unfamiliar school in another town for a while as her mother appealed for enough aid to rebuild the life they had.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When inspectors arrived at Ms. Fitzgerald's house in November 2012, they pronounced her house ''substantially damaged,'' meaning that more than half of its value had been destroyed overnight. But her homeowner's insurance policy did not cover flood damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had a federally subsidized flood insurance policy, but the company that wrote it offered her just $71,000. She appealed, arguing that her three-bedroom house had been worth more than double that, but her appeal was denied. She appealed again, and was again denied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lacking the wherewithal to start overhauling her house and believing that it was too vulnerable to another big storm, Ms. Fitzgerald paid $11,500 to have it torn down. Now she owns a sandlot surrounded by a fence bearing a sign that warns against trespassing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been a horrendously hard year for me,'' she said. ''If I don't think of this in a way that is going to relieve the anger and upset, then I'll just go back to crying every day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a year after one of the country's largest-ever disaster recovery efforts began, Ms. Fitzgerald is among the more than 30,000 residents of New York and New Jersey who remain displaced by the storm, mired in a bureaucratic and financial limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imposing on relatives and draining their savings while pleading for assistance from a dizzying array of government agencies, they say they fear they will never get home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> said it had provided $1.4 billion in direct aid to victims of the storm and $7.9 billion in flood insurance payouts, and that the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> had made $2.4 billion in low-interest loans to homeowners and businesses. What it did not announce was that less than half of the people who sought emergency money received any, as an analysis by The New York Times of FEMA data shows, or that in many cases flood insurance covered only a fraction of the losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the analysis by The Times, in the areas in and around New York City that were hit hardest by the storm, almost half of the people who received assistance from FEMA got less than $5,000. Most of that money was intended to cover housing and other emergency costs immediately after the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Sandy was a storm like no other in the history of New York. It left more than 100 people dead and caused enormous structural damage that will take years to repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA has received claims for nearly 16 million square feet of drywall, 56,000 furnaces and water heaters and enough paint to cover 43 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the most the agency gave in ''individual assistance'' to any single homeowner was about $36,000. The agency's representatives instructed homeowners to file claims on their flood insurance policies, if they had one, and to apply for loans from the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>, if they qualified. But as those first, small installments ran out, the frustration of negotiating with insurers added to the stress of being displaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think flood insurance underpayments is the single biggest reason for why the rebuilding hasn't really taken off,'' said Benjamin R. Rajotte, director of the Disaster Relief Clinic at the Touro Law Center in Central Islip, N.Y. ''Frequently, people are coming in saying they received half or less of what it would take to rebuild their house, not even to raise them up but just to rebuild.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at FEMA, which oversees the national flood insurance program, said that adjusters had incentive to cover all eligible losses, but that some policyholders might be disappointed at receiving money for what things were worth, rather than what it would cost to replace them. Those with complaints may appeal the decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents of the region were also surprised to have claims denied for damage to the foundations of their houses because the damage was deemed to have resulted from ''earth movement,'' not storm flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those displaced, like Rochelle Grubb of Far Rockaway, Queens, had no insurance at all against a flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Grubb, 41, a special-needs teacher at Public School 256 in Queens, had allowed her flood insurance to lapse before her house on Beach 101st Street was inundated by the fast-rising water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early December, she said she had been tutoring and her husband, Timothy, had been working overtime to come up with the $270,000 they estimated it would cost them to rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said they expected it would be more than a year before they could return to their house, but they do have flood insurance now.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's 101 Street but we all called it One Hundred and Fun Street,'' she said, referring to her close-knit neighbors. ''Now when we see each other, we'd just hug and cry. And we're like, when, when, when?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Too Much Red Tape'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA officials say that their primary goal is to provide emergency aid in the days and weeks after a disaster strikes -- the first splash of what is known in Washington as the cascade of federal assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process of obtaining full compensation for losses is designed to involve several steps and to frustrate efforts to take unfair advantage, as some were accused of doing after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, government officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing beside Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in Manhattan in late October, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that more care was being taken to minimize fraud. ''We're not just sending checks willy-nilly,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest chunks of federal aid for residents come not from FEMA but from HUD, which received $16 billion from Congress to dole out in grants to state and local agencies. That money was part of a total federal allocation of about $60 billion in recovery money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, New York City and the States of New York and New Jersey have received more than $10.2 billion of that money. But they have handed out only a small fraction of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the anniversary of the storm on Oct. 29, New Jersey had spent about $230 million of its grants, but New York City and New York State had made very few payments through their rebuilding programs, known as Build it Back in the city and New York Rising on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Smith, 64, a retired New York Police Department detective, said he had nearly given up hope on receiving enough money to rebuild the cottage he shared with his wife in the Broad Channel section of Queens. ''FEMA has been totally insensitive to what I consider our basic needs,'' said Mr. Smith, who has been living with his wife in their cabin upstate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Build It Back program, he said he had talked to dozens of homeowners in Broad Channel and none had received any money from that program. ''It's close to 15 months later and the only thing we're getting is a bureaucracy and promises,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I want nothing more than to go back to live in Queens, or buy me out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caswell F. Holloway IV, the deputy mayor overseeing Build It Back, said city officials waited until HUD had made its second allocation to the program before telling applicants how much they might receive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's New York Rising program kicked into high gear this October, sending out 4,200 letters that promised $450 million to homeowners and families on Long Island. A second mass-mailing, in November, promised payments to an additional 350 recipients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, the announcement of the latest portion of federal money spurred Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York to declare that ''the aid spigot is now open, money will be flowing.'' He conceded that ''in Year 1, we all agree, the aid flowed too slowly'' and said that there was ''too much red tape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a few of those payments have been made so far, but state officials said on Friday that they had asked HUD to allow them to send more than $650 million directly to 6,666 homeowners before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrett J. Kaiser, a heavy equipment operator who lives with his wife and two children in Patchogue on Long Island, became one of the first beneficiaries of the state's program this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaiser, 37, and his family lived for months in a camping trailer in their next-door neighbors' driveway after the nearby bay rose up and filled their single-level house with two feet of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the storm, he set about tearing out the soaked Sheetrock almost immediately, then had the structure raised seven feet. He personally rebuilt much of it, dipping into his family's savings before he started receiving installments of insurance proceeds that totaled $115,000. In late October, he was one of the first applicants to the New York Rising program to sign the final paperwork to close a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promised payment of $38,000 would cover all of the expenses that FEMA and flood insurance did not, he said last month. He added that he had heard of people receiving promises of as much as $250,000 from New York Rising and that everyone he knew who had applied to the program was satisfied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I feel blessed that the storm hit because I have a wonderful new home,'' said Mr. Kaiser, who has gone into business elevating other homes in flood-prone areas. ''I'm staying forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday evening, Mr. Kaiser had not yet received any money from New York Rising. But after an inquiry from a reporter about the delay, Mr. Kaiser said the full $38,000 was deposited in his account on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Uneven Recovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conni Freestone and her boyfriend, David Fagan, have been sleeping on air mattresses in a rented bungalow they have shared with Ms. Freestone's ailing, 63-year-old mother in Toms River, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had been living in her mother's home in nearby Point Pleasant when the hurricane drove water from a creek into the garage and main floor of the two-story house. The flood ruined most of the instruments used by Mr. Fagan's band and the equipment Ms. Freestone used as a freelance photographer. But the flood insurance on the house did not cover those contents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Freestone had been frustrated by the slow response of FEMA to their many appeals for help and found out only after pestering Gov. Chris Christie in public that the agency had estimated the damage to the house at less than $7,000. (An aide to Mr. Christie investigated and discovered the low estimate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sum amounted to a fraction of the $83,000 a local contractor said the repairs would cost. The family had been paying for his work out of equity withdrawn from the house, which was their main asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that work, including electrical wiring, proved shoddy, Ms. Freestone said, and the family was afraid to move back in. With mold climbing the new drywall, they decided to sue the first contractor and find another. But they had received just $55,000 from their insurance policies, so they kept asking for more help as the anniversary of the storm came and went.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt like I was begging,'' Ms. Freestone said of her frequent appeals to FEMA and state agencies. ''When I did suck it up and begged, I got shot down. I'm used to being the volunteer, not the one asking for help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparities in recovery from Hurricane Sandy are on stark display in Long Beach, N.Y., on the block of modest homes where Ms. Fitzgerald and Megan lived next door to a couple, Anne Walsh and Penny Ryan. Their two-story houses, which stood side by side on lots of just 1,800 square feet, suffered similar damage when the floodwaters rose above their floorboards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Long Beach officials did not declare Ms. Walsh and Ms. Ryan's house to be ''substantially damaged.'' And that determination has made all the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Ms. Fitzgerald, they were cleared to fix up their home without having to elevate it off the ground. So now Ms. Walsh and Ms. Ryan return from work in New York City to a pin-neat living room with a gleaming floor made of Brazilian teak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within weeks after the waters receded, Ms. Walsh, a nurse, and Ms. Ryan, a public school principal, had dipped into their savings to pay a contractor to start tearing out and replace the ruined floors and walls. All told, they said, they had spent about $200,000 to restore their home -- considerably more than they recouped through FEMA, flood insurance and a $26,000 grant from New York Rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went from having a comfortable lifestyle to being totally in debt,'' said Ms. Ryan, 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Walsh said she thought it would take five years for the neighborhood they cherished to come fully back to life. Some houses still sit dark and boarded up, others are being raised several feet to avoid another flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fitzgerald had held out hope that the New York Rising program would come through with a grant big enough to bridge the wide gap between what she received from her insurance companies and what it would cost to build a house from scratch so close to New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she finally got her answer from New York Rising, Ms. Fitzgerald said she was ''wrecked'' by ''bitter disappointment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state had calculated that her house could be rebuilt for $160,000, so they subtracted the $84,000 they say she had received from other sources since the storm and awarded her $76,000. She said that she thought it would cost closer to $250,000 to rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she has already spent some of her insurance proceeds to pay for demolition and plans and permits for a new house, leaving her with far less than what she needs to rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not looking for anything fabulous,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said, choking back the frustration of not knowing if she and her daughter would ever get back to Delaware Avenue. ''I love that block,'' she said. ''I want to build back.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago, I attended something called the Web Summit, a massive tech-industry conference held in Dublin over the course of a couple of days. The event had a two-tier structure: on one level, it was a vast, teeming trade show at which early-stage start-ups were given the opportunity to set out their stalls and sell themselves -- to venture capitalists, angel investors, media people -- and to network with one another; but on a more elevated plane, it was a grand conclave of the tech industry's high priests, who came from all over the world (though mostly Northern California) to deliver talks and public interviews to audiences of several thousand.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the conference, I wandered among the crowds and jotted things down in my conspicuously antediluvian notebook, indulging myself in an essayist-at-large routine, partly encouraged by an editor at Wired who expressed an interest in my writing something about the Irish technology-start-up ecosystem. After sufficient exposure to this stuff ---- to 20-minute multimedia presentations, ''fireside chats'' with victorious founders, public pitches to panels of venture capitalists -- my perception of these entrepreneurial people began to blur to the point where they converged, all of them, into one breezily self-assured dude with a cordless head mike and an overinvestment in the concept of disruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also noticed that this composite dude (late 30s, suit jacket, jeans) had a common tendency to place himself, personally, at the center of his business's narrative, and that this narrative tended to involve some triumph over the skepticism of others, of those who said that it (whatever it was: a smartphone app for ordering taxis, say, or a new kind of online payment model) couldn't be done. The engine that seemed to drive all this ambition and achievement, all this ceaseless and remorseless disruption of everything not nailed to the floor, was a hot and incorruptible core of self-belief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as I was noticing this, I was also increasingly preoccupied by the extent to which I myself lacked this internal combustion of self-confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as I filled page after page of my notebook with observations and snatches of overheard dialogue, I found that I was essentially unconvinced by my own performance as the literary interloper, as the man of letters at large in the assembly of numbers. In my tepid blood, in my timid little heart, I did not feel it with any persuasive force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I knew almost nothing about the topic I was supposed to be writing on and would have little of interest to say about it no matter what I learned. Nothing, I felt sure, was likely to come of my efforts. Less than nothing; I was wasting my time, whatever that might be worth on the open market. I saw a keen absurdity in these barons of techno-capital, with their passionately held clichés and their cheerful belief in their personal capacity to change the world, but I found myself wishing forlornly that some of that confidence, that profitable self-delusion, might rub off on me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because if I had to identify a single element that characterizes my life as a writer, a dominant affective note, it would be self-doubt. It is a more-or-less constant presence in everything I do. It is there even as I type these words, in my realization that almost all writers struggle in this way; that the notion of a self-doubting writer is as close to tautology as to make no difference, and that to refer to such a thing as a ''struggle'' is to concede the game immediately to cliché, to lose on a technicality before you've even begun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of ''the inner critic'' is one the self-improvement industry is fond of invoking, generally with reference to the various methods by which it might be silenced or banished. But the problem with my inner critic is that it's inseparable from my outer critic, which is the means by which I earn a fair proportion of what for rhetorical purposes I will call ''my living.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've spent so much of my adult life writing criticism -- as an academic and then as a former academic writing about books and culture -- that I have begun to detect a sort of hypertrophic enlargement of the part of my brain that looks at what the other parts are doing or planning to do and says, ''Sorry, chief, but that's not going to cut it.'' My concern here is that I have inadvertently allowed my inner critic to become the writer in residence of my very soul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I'm ambivalent about this, as I am in matters of any significance. I often wonder, in my more self-indulgent moments, by which, I suppose, I mean all the time, what I might have achieved if I had not so often and so easily fallen prey to self-doubt: all the things I might have written, all the books and essays and so on, and how good they might have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I feel certain, in these moments, that I would be a great deal more successful and productive if my inner critic had not been afforded this tenured position from which to shoot down anything not measuring up to its supposedly exacting standards. But then I invariably remind myself, with some gratitude, of all the dreadful fates I've been saved from by the graceful intercession of self-doubt, all the misguided and misbegotten ideas that never made it off the pages of their respective notebooks because they had no business being written in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put it in the sort of simplistic terms that I'll no doubt come to regret using: self-doubt is the best friend and the worst enemy of the writer. Because being a writer isn't like being a tennis player or a boxer, where you presumably have to hunt down and ruthlessly eliminate the source of any flickering shadow of suspicion that you might not be destined for victory. As a writer, you have to take your own misgivings seriously; you have to attend, now and then, to the little voice in your head or the booming baritone in your gut that wishes you to know that what you are writing is entirely without value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trick, of course, is to know when to listen to it and when to tell it to shut its stupid fat face. I say this as someone who has never quite learned that particular trick. And so because I seem congenitally predisposed to doubt myself, I tend to err on the side of caution with these things; I tend to listen to what the inner critic is saying, on the assumption that it probably knows what it's talking about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erring on the side of caution has, paradoxically, always been one of the major forms of erring in my life. I am cautious, at times, to the point of outright recklessness. My dealings with the physical world are characterized by a peculiar form of clumsiness: the clumsiness of the excessively careful man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a driver, for instance, I have a tendency to overcorrect for minor errors and to take somewhat extreme measures in the evasion of essentially trivial hazards. And I have, more generally, a weird inability to prioritize respective levels of physical threat: I'll have a clutch of magazines in one hand, say, and a mug of steaming coffee in the other, and one of the magazines will begin to slip from my hand, and instead of just letting it fall to the floor (because, really, how terrible could that be?), I'll foolishly try to prevent this tiny disaster by grabbing at it with the other hand, in which, let's remember, I'm already holding the mug of steaming coffee, thereby initiating a much greater disaster, involving smashed mug, damaged magazines and serious unintended consequences in the form of stained trousers and scalded kneecaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My trouble with self-doubt is of a piece, I think, with this reckless carefulness, this tendency toward overcorrection. Self-doubt, like physical caution, is a useful prophylactic against serious error, but there's a point at which it starts being more a cause of problems than a prevention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following, for example, is a frequent enough occurrence in my professional life: I'll pitch an editor with an idea for something I want to write about, and they'll tell me to go ahead with it, and then I'll straight away begin a process of deconvincing myself, of deciding that the article I've persuaded someone to pay me to write is actually not worth writing at all or that I'm not the person to write it. And at this point, of course, it's too late to back out, and I have to go ahead and write it anyway; a whole routine that is very time-consuming and enervating in the extreme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(I don't want to get too cute here, but let me just point out, parenthetically, that this essay has itself been subject to exactly this pendular swing of progress and reversal. I thought it would be a good idea to write an essay about writing and self-doubt, and no sooner had I got the culture editor of this magazine to agree with me than I began to have serious doubts about my own capacity to say anything of any worth on the topic. And to be 100 percent honest with you, I'm currently undergoing serious misgivings about even bringing this up here, not least because this kind of spiraling metacommentary of creative self-torture seems like something Charlie Kaufman basically holds the patent on.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that the inner critic is actually an indispensable element of any writer's working life; it is the immune system, the necessary resistance against the toxicity of bad writing. Excessive self-doubt is therefore like a sort of autoimmune disease, caused by an overactive and overpowerful inner critic: the cure becomes the condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years back, the journalist and essayist John Jeremiah Sullivan spoke in an interview about the effects his work as an editor of other writers has had on his own writing. It made him more exacting, he felt, more ruthless when it came to his own prose. But the danger, he continued, ''is you go too far with that, and you can't write, because the critical voice is just so powerful from the very beginning, it smothers what you want to say. You're trying to light matches in a rainstorm of self-doubt. Writing has to believe in itself as it's happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is exactly right, I think. For all that you need to be aware of the perils of irrelevance and self-indulgence -- to guard against the jarring insertion of coffee-spilling slapstick into otherwise serious essays, say, or against excessively self-referential subclauses -- to get anything done at all, you also basically have to ignore that necessary awareness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so perhaps the solution lies in cultivating a paradoxically self-conscious form of delusion. You need to believe in what you're doing when you're doing it, even if you don't fully believe in that belief. The technique, perhaps, is in doubting your own self-doubt. But then, really, what do I know? I'm not even convinced it was a good idea to write this thing in the first place.</p>

But for those hoping the nation's latest economic plan will drag Japan from its long malaise, the young men and women here at Samurai Startup Island represent a crucial component: a revival of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signs of that comeback are still new, and tentative enough that the statistics on start-ups and initial public offerings have not caught up. But analysts and investors report that hundreds of new Internet and technology-related companies have sprung up in the last two to three years, creating an ecosystem of incubators like Samurai Startup Island and so-called accelerator new venture investment funds, which invest in early-state start-ups in hopes of cashing in.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some top universities -- the same ones that have long defined success as a job in an established company or elite government ministry -- have begun not only to create their own incubators and venture funds, but also to develop curriculums on birthing start-ups. And while some young entrepreneurs say real progress will come only if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe acts as promised to shake up Japan's hidebound corporate culture, they say the stock market rally and broader optimism created by the economic plan known as Abenomics are already making it easier to find investors and customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the beginning of something that could rejuvenate Japan,'' said Mitsuru Izumo, the founder of Euglena Corporation, a biotechnology start-up valued at $1 billion, and one of the country's most prominent new entrepreneurs. ''If we don't unleash our youth, then Japan will become too weak to survive another blow like Fukushima. Entrepreneurship is Japan's last chance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, sagging entrepreneurial spirit has been cited as a major reason for Japan's inability to save itself from a devastating deflationary spiral. The nation that produced <span class="companylink">Sony</span>, Toyota and Honda has created few successors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Japan has a long tradition of entrepreneurship in blue-collar trades like manufacturing, it has had only limited success in extending that to more knowledge-based industries like software or computing, at the forefront of the digital age and where competitors like South Korea have sped ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, under then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's effort to revive the economy, Japan appeared to embrace young entrepreneurs. But the resurgence was mostly snuffed out when the most prominent of these newcomers, a brash young Internet mogul named Takafumi Horie who roared around Tokyo in Ferraris, was imprisoned for securities fraud. For other young entrepreneurs, his guilt or innocence was not the story. They saw his downfall as a cautionary tale of how Japan's graying establishment would crush those who challenged its rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Samurai Startup Island, in a low-rent office district built on a landfill on Tokyo Bay, is at the vanguard of what many hope is a new generation of innovators, and a world apart from Japan's highly conformist corporate world. The most prominent of several start-up incubators that have sprung up in Tokyo, it offers a variety of services, including free legal advice, cheap office space, espresso machines and bunk beds for all-nighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, dozens of young Japanese sat at long wooden tables in the airy loftlike space. Ceiling-high scrolls of scowling samurai warriors and paintings of pink cherry blossoms adorn the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eclecticism is intentional, said the Island's creator, Kentaro Sakakibara. Entrepreneurs must seek inspiration in Japan's historical figures, particularly bold, but selfless, samurai, he said. He advised avoiding the flashy consumption and public hubris of Mr. Horie to make entrepreneurship more palatable to Japan's proudly egalitarian society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The samurai spirit is about taking risks, but in a humble, low-key way that suits Japan,'' said Mr. Sakakibara, 39, who has invested in many of the 60 start-up companies now at the Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Horie remains a revered figure among the new entrepreneurs, who view him as a pioneering, if flawed, figure: Mr. Sakakibara says he invites Mr. Horie, now out of prison, to give pep talks at the Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he started investing in new companies six years ago, Mr. Sakakibara was lucky if two would-be entrepreneurs approached him in a week to seek financing. Now he gets two such queries a day, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and others closely watching start-ups attribute the increase in interest to cultural shifts that have slowly chipped away at Japan's famously insular culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having grown up immersed in an online world that stretches beyond national borders, young Japanese appear more willing to draw inspiration from foreign role models like Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple. And having seen <span class="companylink">Sony</span> cede market share to South Korea's Samsung, many no longer share their salarymen fathers' belief in the permanence of established corporations or lifetime jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a world where everything is risky, it's better to be your own boss, in charge of your own destiny,'' said Yoshinori Fukushima, 25, whose year-old Internet company has grown to 14 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While seeking a master's degree in software engineering, he founded his company, Gunosy, to sell an app he wrote that analyzes social media pages to find news stories of potential interest to users. He says he turned down job offers at established firms before starting his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were driven by the fear of becoming yet another ''lost generation'' like people who came of age during Japan's long downturn in the 1990s and 2000s, when a dearth of new jobs and opportunities left many young people underemployed or unemployed, and downwardly mobile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Japan has said enough to being depressed, time to unleash our animal spirits,'' said Robert Eberhart, a professor of management at <span class="companylink">Santa Clara University</span> in California who has studied start-ups in Japan and Silicon Valley. ''Now, I think there is more excitement about entrepreneurship in Japan than in the U.S.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some warn that Japan has a way to go to become a hotbed of break-the-boundaries venture behavior. Noriyuki Takahashi, who specializes in entrepreneurship at Tokyo's Musashi University, pointed to comparative global surveys that place Japan at the bottom among leading Western and Asian economies in social acceptance of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Silicon Valley-style venture capitalism to truly flourish, he and others said, deep-seated prejudices against entrepreneurs -- who are seen as too greedy or self-promoting in a culture that abhors displays of unrestrained ego -- must be overcome. The biggest hurdle is the stigma the downfall of Mr. Horie placed on entrepreneurship, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those trying to find a new path -- and create a more culturally acceptable version of the Japanese entrepreneur -- is Mr. Izumo, the founder of the biotechnology start-up, who has become a fixture in local media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company, Euglena, aims to turn plankton into a source of low-cost nutrition for the developing world and the raw material for a new type of biofuel for jets. While the company's main product has been a bright green health drink, investors have been sufficiently impressed; in December, Euglena's initial listing on the stock market valued the company at more than $1 billion, turning Mr. Izumo, 33, into an instant multimillionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Izumo is careful to eschew any sign of conspicuous consumption; he lives in a one-room apartment, owns neither a car nor a television set and says he wants his product to feed the poor in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Horie gave entrepreneurship a negative image, as something too greedy,'' said the enthusiastic Mr. Izumo, who sported a bright green necktie. ''Young entrepreneurs are out to change that mind-set.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the greatest sign of change is the number of elite university graduates -- the type who can still get high-level corporate jobs if they want -- among start-up founders. Mr. Izumo and Mr. Fukushima, the Internet entrepreneur, are graduates of the <span class="companylink">University of Tokyo</span>, among Japan's top colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university says 25 companies are being incubated in what it calls its ''entrepreneur plaza.'' And Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University, which this year introduced a program for supporting start-ups, says it has already produced five new businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers might seem small, said Shigeo Kagami, a business professor who helps run the <span class="companylink">University of Tokyo</span> incubator, ''but the fact this is happening at all is a big chance for Japan. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As Steve Jobs showed,'' he said, ''it only takes one or two success stories to change the world.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kim Gustafson moved to Vail Valley in Colorado more than a decade ago, he was 54 and had recently retired as an executive in the office-equipment business. But he wasn't ready to stop working. ''I'm not the type of person who wanted to play checkers,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gustafson is one of a growing number of baby boomers starting businesses later in life -- though that was not his original plan. Initially, he worked as a ski instructor. But he found that degenerative arthritis and the wear-and-tear of his rigorous skiing schedule were exacerbating an injury he had sustained several years earlier after falling from a ladder.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gustafson sought treatment at the Steadman Clinic, an orthopedic surgery center based in Vail, eventually undergoing five knee surgeries. To continue to teach skiing, he was told, he would need to wear a hard, cumbersome knee brace every time he hit the slopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he grew accustomed to the brace, he began to wonder whether people with less vulnerable joints than his might benefit from a more pliable and comfortable form of knee support -- perhaps a pair of tights. To explore this possibility, he turned to a group of biomechanical experts at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, a branch of the Steadman Clinic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coincidentally, the researchers had been contemplating something similar, and they began drawing sketches of nylon and spandex tights embedded with bands of rigid fabric to protect the knees by restoring them to their natural alignment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gustafson and scientists from the institute struck up an unusual agreement: They would develop the tights together, and if the product reached the marketplace, the institute would receive royalties to be applied to future research projects or the hiring of scientists. Within two years, Mr. Gustafson started a company he eventually called Opedix and began selling the biomechanically engineered tights online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His decision to start a business in his late 50s is far from unusual. A report this year by the <span class="companylink">Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</span> found that late-in-life entrepreneurs -- ages 55 to 64 -- now comprise 23 percent of new business owners, up from 14 percent in 1996. And the results of a survey released this month by the Pew Research Center showed that baby boomers were less likely to say that job security was ''extremely important'' to them compared with two younger groups: millennials and members of Generation X -- suggesting an inclination toward entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is partly rooted in a quest for personal fulfillment, says Stewart Friedman, director of the Work/Life Integration Project at the Wharton School of Business at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>. ''Among boomers, of which I am one, our whole early life in the '60s and '70s was about self-actualization,'' Mr. Friedman says, adding that many in his generation are finally now revisiting career aspirations that they abandoned years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Age and experience, however, aren't always considered assets in wider entrepreneurial circles, says Elizabeth Isele, founder of Senior Entrepreneurship Works, which runs entrepreneurship training courses for those over 50. She says that many lenders are skeptical of older people's ability to repay loans and that the biggest challenge for this age group is access to capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Part of that is because people haven't heard of senior entrepreneurship,'' she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Mr. Gustafson has self-funded his venture along with his brother, David, who serves as president. But even for older entrepreneurs investing their own money in start-ups, the financial risks of a new venture can be daunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opedix faces several challenges, including the fact that it is competing in a crowded field. ''There's a long history of companies trying to come up with technologies to restore normal function to an injured joint or prevent injury to a joint that's at risk,'' says Bruce Beynnon, director of research at the department of orthopedics and rehabilitation at the University of Vermont's College of Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opedix has struggled to differentiate itself from another type of garment that's popular with runners and looks very similar: compression tights. What sets Opedix tights apart, Mr. Gustafson says, are the bands of stiff fabric that descend down the leg from the hips, wrap around the knees and extend to the ankles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The added complexity confers a higher price: Opedix tights sell for $225 a pair, usually twice the price of compression tights. But to the uneducated eye, the two tights are virtually indistinguishable, which can confuse shoppers. (Earlier this year, Opedix also began selling shorts designed to restore the pelvis's natural alignment; they cost $165.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Gustafson's strategies for educating potential customers is to put the tights in the hands of physical therapists, trainers, sports instructors and professional athletes who are likely to understand the banding technology -- and, he hopes, to spread the word.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gustafson sees an advantage in making a product geared toward the boomer population. The tights could hold wide appeal for the many members of this generation who have benefited from medical advances and plan to stay active into their 70s and 80s. By 2017, the over-50 set will control 70 percent of the disposable income in the United States and is expected to comprise about half of the population, according to data compiled by Nielsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gustafson says he believes the experience and skills he cultivated in his earlier career, which included tenures at two start-ups, have been a plus in his work at Opedix. For instance, he knew how laborious it would be to develop and test a new product, and he understood the benefits of working in a field he liked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love the ski business,'' he says. ''It's a whole lot more exciting and interesting than office equipment, I'll tell you.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI, India -- India has built a reputation as a notoriously tough place to do business, one that has stymied even giants like <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>. And unlike Silicon Valley, where a decent idea can attract funding, investors in India are much more reluctant to risk their money on start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such challenges, some American technology entrepreneurs are seeking to pursue the country's untapped opportunities, even without the clout of a multinational corporation backing them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Frykman, 30, of Palos Verdes, Calif., found his network of support at <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span>, where he was a doctoral student in mechanical engineering. With the help of an angel investor in the United States, he created a pilot study in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu in 2008 for his agricultural start-up, Driptech, which makes affordable, efficient irrigation systems for small-plot farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea for Driptech had its origins in Ethiopia, where Mr. Frykman traveled with a team in 2008 as part of the Extreme Affordability program at Stanford, in which students tackle real-world problems. But he found that for all its flaws as an investment destination, India had much less political risk than African nations and had better infrastructure. The nation also had more subsistence farmers than all of Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011 Mr. Frykman moved to Pune, India, after Driptech closed a funding round led by Khosla Impact, founded by the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. ''It's kind of unusual to start a company and then realize that the biggest opportunity is in India,'' Mr. Frykman said. ''We sort of did it backwards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India may be home to many of the largest outsourcing consulting firms, and tech-oriented cities like Bangalore have attracted global technology giants like <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>. But attracting American-style entrepreneurism here has happened in fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American-based venture capital firms and the Indian units of American venture capital firms, like <span class="companylink">Sequoia Capital India</span>, invested $172 million this year through mid-December, excluding joint ventures. That fell from $250 million in 2006, according to Venture Intelligence, a research service based in Chennai that is focused on private equity. In the latest <span class="companylink">World Bank</span> rankings on the ease of doing business, India slipped three spots, to 134th out of 189 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 42 venture capital firms based in the United States, however, have either opened offices in India or opened Indian units since 2006, according to Venture Intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the challenges, the sheer potential in a country of 1.2 billion people with a stable middle class is enough to tempt entrepreneurs and multinationals alike to explore opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the earlier years after I moved to India, around 2008-10, there was astounding growth in the mobile market, with 20 million new subscribers being added to the telecom network every month,'' said Valerie R. Wagoner of Modesto, Calif., 30, chief executive of the mobile marketing firm ZipDial in Bangalore. That monthly growth was nearly equivalent to the population of Australia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wagoner was working for <span class="companylink">eBay</span> when she decided it was time to shift her focus to her passion: emerging markets and technology. She did extensive networking in India with executives at mobile payment providers and joined mChek in Bangalore in 2008 as head of strategic initiatives. In 2010, she founded ZipDial, whose investors include 500 Startups, a Silicon Valley seed fund; <span class="companylink">Jungle Ventures</span> of Singapore; and the Indian firms Blume Ventures and Unilazer Ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frustrations of doing business in India include bureaucratic hurdles in licensing and making other filings, and pressure for bribes, which Americans cannot legally give. Many start-ups avoid these hurdles by catering to private clients and by making products that do not need governmental approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs have also had to adjust business plans quickly to get around complications. Sam White and Sorin Grama, co-founders of Promethean Power, won second place and $10,000 in a business plan contest at M.I.T. in 2007 with the idea of using solar technology for rural electrification in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''India was the last country on my list to even visit -- never had any interest,'' Mr. White said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grama, 44, a Romanian-born American citizen, and Mr. White, of Boston, both eventually moved to Mumbai in 2012. They ran into problems from the start in trying to make a cost-effective solar milk chiller for villages where milk was collected for dairies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, they spent six months building a prototype, only to have the managing director of Hatsun, India's largest private dairy, point out that the 2,000-liter thermal battery that was used to store cold thermal energy was too big for any shed found in the villages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, they let go of the idea of being a solar company. Instead, they developed a thermal battery that is able to take advantage of the intermittent power on the grid. The battery releases a cold fluid that chills milk quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the company has Hatsun as a client and has attracted funding from clean technology investors like the Quercus Trust, angel investors and grants by the <span class="companylink">National Science Foundation</span> and the United States-India Science and Technology Endowment Fund, which was founded by the two nations' governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Eighty percent was our own mistakes -- we would have faced them in any country,'' Mr. White said. ''But we always learned from those mistakes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A common complaint among the entrepreneurs was the difficulty in finding and keeping good employees. Even by Silicon Valley standards, Indian tech employees are restless. ''The job market is so hot it's not uncommon for a young person to think they can build a career by quitting within three months to get a pay raise somewhere else,'' said Ms. Wagoner of ZipDial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech companies have to offer salaries at the market rate or higher to attract job seekers, who prefer the stability of a conglomerate over opportunities for personal growth. In fact, Mr. Frykman said the ''lack of coolness'' associated with a start-up was one of the biggest surprises he encountered. For this reason, Indians are less eager for stock options than their counterparts in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To increase Indian employees' exposure to such incentives, Ms. Wagoner has made stock ownership plans part of ZipDial's compensation package and will give additional grants to people without their asking if she thinks they deserve them. ''I believe it is very important that people who are taking a risk in building a company see the benefits of that,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs, for their part, have embraced another Silicon Valley trait and learned to try again after failure. Rahoul Mehra, 42, founded Saf Labs, a biotechnology trading company in Mumbai, with his wife, Glennis Matthews Mehra, a 39-year-old neuroscientist. They originally wanted to run all operations out of New York, where they lived. ''In doing business with India, we never intended for us to move to India,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2008, two years into the business, which they had financed on their own, Mr. Mehra realized that deals would not be properly managed unless he was in Mumbai. Dr. Mehra reluctantly followed with their daughter, then 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business managed to turn a profit and attract a private European investor so the company could expand into biotech services. But in 2012, after the <span class="companylink">Indian government</span> delayed biotech funding for its new five-year plan, Saf Labs' business was drying up. The Mehras realized they had to move away from the Indian market and focus more on international opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they are negotiating a sale of the company and using their experiences to market advisory services for Indian companies that want to expand overseas or foreign companies looking to enter India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other entrepreneurs, too, have begun exploring expansion to other emerging markets: ZipDial has already entered Southeast Asia. Driptech has sold its products in Africa, and Promethean Power is moving into Pakistan, Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know who said it, but there's a saying that what you're going to find in India are little islands of excellence: people -- despite the country, despite India -- who are succeeding,'' Mr. Mehra said. ''If you can connect those dots, you can make a real go of it here.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No credit? No problem -- just take a test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the message being delivered to more than 70,000 small-business owners in developing countries where credit ratings are rare and many potential entrepreneurs keep their money in cash rather than bank accounts.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks in 16 countries are using a psychometric test to predict future behavior -- specifically, whether someone will pay back a loan. Originally a Harvard doctoral project, the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab's test has increasingly won the confidence of risk-averse bankers in places where, many economists believe, credit bottlenecks are severely stunting growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a new partnership with <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> has potential to speed the model's proliferation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States and other mature economies, assessments by multiple credit agencies based on a lifetime of bill payments and account balances help determine with relative confidence whether to give an individual or business a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lack of such data in much of the rest of the world creates a ''massive inefficiency in emerging markets,'' said Bailey Klinger, 34, the chief executive of the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab. Banks have money to lend, but even profitable small businesses often cannot access it, choking growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In wealthy countries like the United States, small- and medium-size enterprises are typically responsible for about half of business activity and almost two-thirds of employment gains. In poor countries, such enterprises, on average, account for only about 17 percent of spending and a third of new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Klinger was studying this problem, known as the ''missing middle,'' with Prof. Asim Khwaja at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. They struck upon a technique some companies have long used to screen potential employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jhonathan Darwin Montes Mendoza, a 40-minute test led to a $1,500 loan last year to buy Christmas-themed towels, curtains and other decorations ahead of the holiday rush for his market stall in Lima, Peru. Mr. Montes's score gave <span class="companylink">Banco Interamericano de Finanzas</span> confidence he would pay back the loan -- even though he had been in business for less than a year, with no credit history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't give a loan to someone without knowing if they have psychological problems,'' said Mr. Montes, 23, in Spanish, perhaps not fully understanding what the test was measuring. Though similar to tools used by psychologists to assess I.Q., define personalities or screen for addictions, the bank's test was intended to measure the traits at the core of entrepreneurship: fluid intelligence, business skill, integrity and attitudes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After paying back the first loan, Mr. Montes is on a second round, paying down a $2,500 debt. The finance lab calibrates the test for each country where it is introduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lab's model asks questions that do not necessarily have a right answer; using an algorithm, it aims to predict whether an individual is likely to default based on how the answers relate to one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, to assess their sense of personal control over outcomes -- which tends to correlate with loan repayment -- respondents might be asked to rate how much they agree or disagree with the statement: ''I believe in the power of fate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another question on risk tolerance might ask them to choose between opposing responses with equal social desirability, such as: ''I plan for every eventuality,'' ''I'm in between'' or ''Planning takes the fun out of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some unexpected findings: Optimism and self-confidence are good signs among seasoned entrepreneurs, but high levels in younger business owners do not bode well, statistically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the math and reasoning questions meant to measure fluid intelligence can also assess integrity -- of the loan officer. Too many correct answers can reveal that an applicant was coached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small-business loans have proved to be a ''good revenue source'' for <span class="companylink">Banco Interamericano de Finanzas</span>, the fifth-largest commercial bank in Peru, where they have increased by about 50 percent, said Hugo Palomino, its director of commercial products. Over the last year and a half, repayment rates on loans made with the entrepreneurial finance lab's model have been about the same as those that used a traditional assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big difference for the borrowers is that under the traditional model, those who did manage to get a loan with minimal credit history would pay about 60 percent interest, said Mr. Palomino. Instead, people like Mr. Montes can qualify for rates of 30 to 45 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Standard Bank, Africa's largest, first adopted E.F.L.'s model in Kenya in 2008, bankers around the world have used it to lend more than $200 million, in average amounts of $7,500, to entrepreneurs who would not have otherwise qualified, the finance lab's founders say. Now an independent company based in Lima with about 30 employees, the Entrepreneurial Finance Lab has grown with the help of grants, including a $3.6 million prize for being among the winners of a G-20 challenge for small-business financing in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the program's early successes are ''by no means final validation that the model will really work,'' said Peer Stein, a director at the <span class="companylink">World Bank</span>'s <span class="companylink">International Finance Corporation</span>, which administers the G-20 challenge grant. The loan test, he said, would ''probably have to go through still other iterations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klinger, the lab's director, agreed. The test is ''not a silver bullet,'' he said, adding that the overall value of the portfolio still depended on other aspects of the bank's operations. ''A lot of banks we work with are using that very successfully, and some are using it less successfully,'' Mr. Klinger said. Some have stopped using it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DJ DiDonna, 30, the firm's chief operating officer, was recruited from Harvard Business School to be, as he put it, the ''greedy capitalist.'' During the first year, Mr. DiDonna's job was to tote academic data around the world and tell financial executives that they should ''operationalize this inside your bank; sort of hand over your business decision-making with us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was a tough sell,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Inter-American Development Bank</span> and its <span class="companylink">Multilateral Investment Fund</span> made his job easier in Latin America by helping banks pay for adoption and guaranteeing some of the new loans. More potential to expand will come in January, when <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> plans to start a pilot program for small-business accounts at BHD Bank in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Glassman, <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>'s group executive for global commercial products, said he had been looking for alternative underwriting models after hearing from banks that they would like to do more with small business, but didn't have the right tools to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the model needs more tweaking to take into account the differences between term loans and credit cards, Mr. Glassman said, ''with the emergence of electronic payments, the whole transition from cash to electronic -- which is sweeping the marketplace around the world -- this is a very logical fit.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following is the text of Gov. Chris Christie's State of the State address, as prepared for delivery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Legislators, friends, fellow New Jerseyans:</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last week has certainly tested this Administration. Mistakes were clearly made. And as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve. I know our citizens deserve better. Much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I also want to assure the people of New Jersey today that what has occurred does not define us or our state. This Administration and this Legislature will not allow the work that needs to be done to improve the people's lives in New Jersey to be delayed. I am the leader of this state and its people and I stand here today proud to be both. And always determined to do better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I come before you once again to report on the state of our state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today, the state of the state is good, and getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, we were in the throes of economic crisis. Today, our unemployment rate is 7.8%, the lowest in 5 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, we were losing jobs. Today, we have gained 70,000 jobs in the last year alone, and a total of 156,000 in the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, wealth and jobs were leaving the state. Today, personal income for New Jerseyans is at an all-time high, and we are attracting new companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that has brought jobs -- four straight years of private sector job growth. In fact, in November, the drop in our unemployment rate was the largest one month drop ever measured. And in the last year, New Jersey had the second largest drop in its unemployment rate in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could have chosen to go down a path of continued tax increases to fund the state's addiction to spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we didn't. We held the line against any new taxes, and brought spending in the current fiscal year to a level below Fiscal 2008 -- six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We could have let state government grow, even while the private sector shrank. But we didn't. Today, there are 6,000 fewer state employees than four years ago, but over 155,000 more private sector employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We improved our business climate, and today, by every measure, business confidence in New Jersey is up. In fact, one national magazine ranked New Jersey among the top 5 states with the most improved business climates in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no accident how we got to this place today. We chose the way. And in this new year and in the next four years, we need to build on this momentum by creating a new attitude: we need to create an attitude of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not about choosing everything; it is not about saying yes to everyone; it is about setting our priorities and choosing to invest in New Jersey where it matters and to put in place the reforms and reductions that make it possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the best part of our turnaround in these past four years is because we have chosen to work together. These are our achievements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four balanced budgets. Passed with bipartisan support. Pension reform and tenure reform. Passed with bipartisan support. A cap on property taxes. Passed with bipartisan support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We acted and we acted together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the competition among the states is fierce, no state has shown more bipartisan cooperation over the last four years than New Jersey. Let's do it again. Let's resolve that in spite of politics, we will continue to put our people first. We will choose to do our jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the things that drove people out of New Jersey in the past decade was high property taxes. In 2010, together, we capped them. The 2% cap has worked. In these past two years, property tax growth has been the lowest in two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the job is not finished. Property taxes are still too high. So today, I ask for you to join me in enacting a new property tax relief initiative that tackles the root causes that are driving up property taxes in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, some context: the 2% cap we've already enacted has worked for a reason. We've done it by controlling costs. We accompanied it with reform of an interest arbitration award system that needed fixing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you know, the interest arbitration cap was not permanent -- it is set to expire this April, unless we act. So I ask you today, let us renew the cap on interest arbitration awards and make the cap permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason property taxes are so high is that our cities and towns are stuck with a series of costly state rules that increase the cost of local government. As the cost of government grows, taxpayers are paying the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have worked with the Senate to try to pass real consolidation and civil service reform. We haven't gotten it done in the Assembly. We need to have an effort that includes everyone responsible for property taxes -- the Senate, the Assembly, our Administration and local government to provide local government with the authority to run their governments like a business: consolidate, share services, cut duplication and ultimately actually reduce property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at what happened last year in Princeton. Princeton Borough and Princeton Township consolidated into a single government. Not two tax departments, two police forces, two offices answering the phone. The savings in one year: $3 million. That's on a budget of $64 million, a 4.7% savings. And the citizens of Princeton got this: more services, despite a smaller budget, and a reduction in municipal taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not just my opinion -- the local unit alignment, reorganization and consolidation commission said that civil service seniority rules were at the top of the list of barriers to shared services. Let's help our towns clear away arcane rules that stand between them and lower property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to driving costs, let's not forget the expensive practice of sick leave payouts for government employees. Sick time should be used when you're sick. If you're lucky enough to be healthy, that's your reward. Sick leave has been abused too many times, and the cost is real. Almost a billion dollars in liability facing New Jersey towns - $880 million to be exact. And it will only get higher if the system is not fixed. These reforms are common sense: let's lift this billion dollar albatross off the necks of New Jersey's towns. Let's together enact the zero means zero plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our pension system is burdened by some who collect disability retirement because they claim they are ''totally and permanently disabled,'' but who are now working full-time. So we've established by Executive Order a special unit to prosecute pension fraud. Let's go even further to solidify our pension system and reduce costs by reforming our disability retirement system to end this fraud and abuse. This will also help us to reduce property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some towns get around the property tax cap by enacting user fees to fund traditional services that used to be in the budget. Let's end this practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will have more to say about New Jersey's taxes when I present my budget to you next month. That is for a reason. We have to consider changes to our tax system in the context of our overall budget picture. We will present some of these choices in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will tell you one choice we will not make -- because it is one answer that will not help grow our state: raising taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the evidence is clear that increasing taxes hurts our growth, it is equally clear that improving education is a key to helping our growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've made some great progress in these past four years: a record amount of school aid, long-overdue reform of our system of teacher tenure, an increase in the number of charter schools and an Urban Hope Act that is bringing renaissance schools to some of our most challenged cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some results are promising too. Last year, New Jersey's high school graduation rate increased by a full percentage point, to 87.5%. Student achievement is strong in many of our public schools, and New Jersey's students are among the country's greatest achievers. Just a few years ago, a graduate of my own high school, Livingston High School, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are making a large investment in public education: New Jersey spends over $25 billion a year, all told. Our per pupil expenditure is the highest in the nation at over $17,000 per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases - too many - our children are not receiving the education they deserve. While many public schools are strong, too many are still failing. While the vast majority of teachers are performing well, some are underperforming -- and they should be removed from the classroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need to be better is particularly acute in New Jersey's cities. Our urban schools demand our attention, and believe me, they have mine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where bold action was necessary, we have taken bold action. And we have made a commitment to the kids in our cities that they have a right to the same quality education as kids in our suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In our largest school system, in Newark, we have brought in a new organization and new resources, not only in the form of state aid but in collaboration with parents, teachers, and community leaders on the ground. One result -- we negotiated a historic contract with the teacher's union and delivered real merit pay alongside increased teacher involvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most importantly we want to encourage innovation while listening to the specific needs of our urban communities. It's the reason why we have empowered our superintendents in Newark and Camden to make choices that work best for their kids, their parents and their schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Newark, that superintendent is Cami Anderson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cami has moved to pay the best teachers, to stop actions that are failing kids, to empower 50 new principals, create cooperation between public schools and charter schools and reorganize the school systems' structure to focus on putting students, schools and parents first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early childhood enrollment has increased by more than 1,000 students. Graduation rates have increased by 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newark is leading the conversation in making sure every kid -- those who are behind, those who are ahead, those who have special education needs -- are lifted up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every kid means every kid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her efforts haven't always been met without skepticism, but she is a true partner with Newark. Cami is here with us today -- Cami, thank you for your commitment to our kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad has it been in Camden? Last year, only three students graduated ''college ready.'' Paymon Rouhanifard is bringing that same energy to Camden's public schools. He has turned around a perennially low-performing charter school to showing some of the largest academic gains in the state. He has launched a new ''safe corridors'' program with Mayor Dana Redd, which has created safe walking routes to and from school for our children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of the 345 students who have dropped out in the last year, we went door-to-door and re-enrolled 50 of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paymon, thank you for your efforts and your dedication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Cami and Paymon have this Administration's confidence and support to continue the aggressive reforms needed that work best for the communities of Newark and Camden and put kids first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cami and Paymon are emblems of my commitment to ensuring the opportunity for an excellent education to every child in New Jersey, regardless of the ZIP code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the improvements we are seeing in Newark and Camden, I believe we need to take bigger and broader steps to adjust our approach to K-12 education to address the new competitive world we live in. Our school calendar is antiquated both educationally and culturally. Life in 2014 demands something more for our students. It is time to lengthen both the school day and school year in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If student achievement is lagging at the exact moment when we need improvement more than ever in order to compete in the world economy, we should take these steps - every possible step - to boost student achievement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one key step is to lengthen the school day and the school year. So, working with Commissioner Cerf, I will present to you shortly a proposal to increase the length of both the school day and the school year in New Jersey. This is a key step to improve student outcomes and boost our competitiveness. We should do it now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of our new initiatives recognize a core feature of modern American life: that the quality of education and the quality of life in our communities are inextricably intertwined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why this year, we need to be more aggressive, and bolder, in fixing our failing schools - and delivering a choice to those for whom today the only option is a bad option: a failing school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a moral obligation. We must give every New Jersey child the chance to graduate from high school, to be ready for college and to prepare for a career. If we fail to meet this obligation, we compromise the life of that child, and we hurt the quality of life in our communities and in New Jersey. So failure is not an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If education is one key to the quality of life in New Jersey communities, our approach to safe streets and stronger communities is another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every New Jerseyan should be concerned when violent crimes occur right before our eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a young lawyer went to open the door of his car for his wife after an evening of pre-Christmas shopping. He was set upon by thugs who wanted to carjack his S.U.V. and, in front of his new wife, he was shot in the head and left for dead on the deck of the mall parking garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outstanding police work led to four arrests, and the suspects are now charged with murder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four had prior criminal records. All four are, fortunately, now in jail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can we tolerate such violence in our midst? The answer is obvious: we cannot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must take a new approach to fighting crime in New Jersey and prevent tragedies like this from happening. We must do everything we can to swiftly jail those violent criminals who bring additional murder and disruption to innocent victims across our state. We have the tools to do this -- some we've begun, some we have not. 2014 must be the year we finish the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What have we not finished? Almost two years ago, I announced a proposed constitutional amendment to modify the right to bail in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept is simple: New Jersey courts should have the right to keep dangerous criminals off the streets and in jail until trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this important? A study by the federal government's Justice Department found that one-third of defendants released before trial ended up being charged with some type of pretrial misconduct. One-sixth were arrested for a new offense -- and half of those were felonies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government allows a violent criminal who is a danger to the community to be held without bail. New Jersey law does not. This must change. How can we justify exposing our citizens to the risk of violent crime at the hands of those, already in custody, who we know are disposed to commit it? There is no justification for that. Let us mirror federal law. Pass bail reform now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, we have made progress in reducing crime in New Jersey. Over the past decade, violent crime is down 16%, both across New Jersey, and in our 15 largest urban centers. And the state's prison population is down 20% since 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we can do better, and we must. Those 15 urban centers still account for more than half of all the violent crime in New Jersey, despite representing only 18% of the state's population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For too long, Camden has been one of the most dangerous cities in New Jersey, and in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability to put police on the street was constrained by tight budgets, low morale, and an absentee rate that sometimes reached 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under an agreement that this Administration signed with the City of Camden and Camden County, we have regionalized the police force. A police force of slightly more than 200 that was sharply reduced in response to budget cuts is now being beefed up to 400 county police officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the homicide rate was down, and the crime rate was down -- by over 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle is far from won. But under Mayor Dana Redd, Police Chief Scott Thomson, and Jose Cordero, who helped decrease crime in East Orange by 75%, Camden is using a new approach -- using technology to predict crime, and engaging the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Camden is moving in the right direction. And I agree with Senator Sweeney that we should have incentives for other communities to adopt the shared service agreements and regional police forces that are making more cops on the street possible. More cops on the streets means safer communities. To make this happen, we will reintroduce shared services and consolidation reform in this session of the Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We must reach out a hand of compassion and common sense to those who commit nonviolent crimes. We must do a better job of reclaiming their lives and putting them back on the road to success and engagement with society. My belief is simple: every human life is precious, and no life is disposable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why I proposed last year to change our approach to nonviolent drug offenders, and mandate treatment, not imprisonment. Together, we made this possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drug court program has been a success, thanks in part to your support in funding both the court and the treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I thank you for passage this past year of the Overdose Protection Act. We should not be prosecuting those Good Samaritans and health professionals who are trying to help in a life-threatening overdose situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's approach to reclaiming lives is working. Recidivism has dropped by 11%, one of the steepest drops in America. And New Jersey is rightly recognized by national experts as a leader among states in reducing incidents of recidivism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For me this is personal. In this room today is a man who was a drug addict at 16 years old. His life was at risk, but treatment saved him. He was rehabilitated at Daytop Village. He graduated from high school, went to college, and ultimately got a law degree. I had the privilege of hiring and working with Craig Hanlon at the U.S. Attorney's Office, and Craig is with us now in this Chamber. If you need proof that reclaiming a life is possible and that every life has precious value, then that proof is standing before you today. Craig, welcome -- and thank you for making new jersey a better place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Craig, I know the passion and strength that comes from the desire to have a better life. And I believe we can do more to help give people a second chance. That is why I am proposing an initiative to expand integrated treatment and employment services for individuals receiving drug treatment services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By providing grant funds in the amount of $500,000 to be managed in partnership with The Nicholson Foundation, we will place individuals in jobs and help improve their retention. We will work directly with treatment providers to integrate employment services with treatment services for drug court participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows that employment during substance abuse treatment helps ensure continued participation in treatment and sustainable long-term employment. With this partnership we will help empower individuals who want and deserve the opportunity to live a life well lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago this afternoon, our state was in recovery from a challenge not of our own making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey in the fall of 2012 -- flooding our homes, turning off our power and destroying our roads. Despite the magnitude and devastation of the storm, Sandy could not break out spirit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past summer, most businesses at the Shore opened on time. Boardwalks were rebuilt. The crowds came back. And schools that had been damaged were reopened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, about nine months after the first phase of CDBG disaster recovery funds started flowing in New Jersey, nearly $900 million -- more than two-thirds of the funds for housing recovery programs are out the door or in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the very beginning, the priority was putting those with the greatest needs and with the most limited financial resources at the front of the line. Of the nearly half of the housing money that has been obligated so far, 72.9% has been awarded to low- and middle-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line is this: we are a long way from the finish line, but we are a long way from where we were one year ago. Challenges remain and I will not rest until every person hurt by Sandy has their life back. That is my mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to thank this Legislature, and all New Jerseyans, for the cooperative, bipartisan and resilient spirit you demonstrated in coming back from Sandy. Let that spirit of Sandy be a powerful lesson to all of us, that when times are most difficult, cooperation and progress are possible. Indeed, they are necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, let me share with you one more, hard truth that makes this new attitude of choice necessary for New Jersey's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have discussed many exciting opportunities for investment in our state. K-12 education. Higher education. Crime prevention. Drug rehabilitation and job training. Health care. Infrastructure investment. Lower taxes. Job growth. All exciting, all of which, done responsibly, could make New Jersey an even greater place. But here is the simple truth. We cannot afford to do it right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of our pension and debt service costs. For the Fiscal Year 2015 Budget, the increase in pension and debt service costs could amount to as much as nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's nearly $1 billion we can't spend on education. That we can't invest in infrastructure improvement. That we can't use to put more cops on the street. That won't be available to improve access to health care. And for those who would advocate for higher income taxes like the ones I have vetoed before, remember that the amount raised would not even cover the increase in our scheduled pension payment and would undoubtedly make us less competitive in the job market nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are the consequences of failing to engage in an attitude of choice. If we continue in an era where we believe we can choose everything, we are really choosing nothing. We need to have the conversation now about further changes to our pension system and to adding further to the state's debt load. But the time to avoid this conversation and these choices is nearly over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we do not choose to reduce our soaring pension and debt service costs, we will miss the opportunity to improve the lives of every New Jersey citizen, not just a select few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am ready to engage in those conversations and help, with you, to truly create an attitude of choice. The result will be a better, smarter, stronger New Jersey. The results from our refusal to choose -- a weaker New Jersey with a middle class burdened by even higher taxes. That is an abandonment of our duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centuries ago, a philosopher wrote that ''choice, not chance, determines your destiny.'' And this remains true for New Jersey today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our destiny is not set -- it is the product of the choices we make. Our future is not set -- it, too, is the product of the choices we make from this day forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let us choose wisely. And let us not fail to act. Let us create an attitude of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us choose to invest in better schools, and not a status quo in which we leave some children behind and put the rest at risk of being swallowed by a rising tide of mediocrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us choose the path of safer streets, and not leave our families vulnerable to the heartless carjackers and muggers who would destroy our quality of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us celebrate every life by creating an opportunity for every citizen, through an excellent education, a productive job, and a thriving community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this hour of choice, let us choose a better New Jersey. For that is what we owe our citizens, our children, and ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey has long been blessed by an abundance of natural resources and human talent. In 2014, we have been blessed by a return to prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let us all choose to make the most of it -- together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of New Jersey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not for the first time, Mr. de Blasio turned to experienced administrators who had worked under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ramanathan Raju, 61, the chief executive of Cook County Health and Hospital System in Chicago, the nation's third largest, will return to New York as president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, where he was chief operating officer before leaving in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Torres-Springer, 36, a former top official at the city's Economic Development Corporation, was appointed small-business services commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Raju becomes the leader of the nation's largest public health system, with 11 public hospitals -- and a $250 million operating deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Cook County hospital system, which Dr. Raju said was one-fifth the size of New York City's, he was credited with quickly shaving $23 million from a $411 million annual taxpayer subsidy in fiscal 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Raju said he had dedicated himself over a 30-year career in public health to helping ''the most vulnerable people'' gain access to care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Luis R. Marcos, a former president of the hospitals corporation, said of Dr. Raju, ''He's a charming person, which is an asset in this field which is so complicated and so filled with competing interests.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In naming Ms. Torres-Springer, Mr. de Blasio said he expected her agency to be an advocate for the city's roughly 200,000 small businesses, not to continue what he said was a practice of subjecting them unfairly to aggressive enforcement and fines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For too long, the central relationship between small business and the city government has been when an inspector walks through the door of that small business ready to issue a fine,'' Mr. de Blasio said. ''That's not what we're here to do in government. Maria's going to help change that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Torres-Springer, who most recently was chief operating officer of Friends of the High Line, the nonprofit conservancy that maintains the High Line park, said that her parents were Filipino immigrants who had struggled to make ends meet, and that she was the first in her family to attend college. She earned degrees from Yale and Harvard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know firsthand what it's like to grow up with very little,'' Ms. Torres-Springer said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many business owners struggle with pricing. Should their first concern be covering costs or figuring out what the market will bear? How do they determine what the market will pay without raising prices high enough that some customers flee? And can they offer discounts without damaging their price brand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be no easy or universal answers to these questions, but new thinking and new technology has made it possible for some, like the airline and hotel industries, to use what is known as dynamic pricing to vary prices according to demand and fill seats and rooms more efficiently. Now, more small businesses are finding ways to adapt their strategies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can find consultants that charge for results rather than by the hour, restaurants that charge what is essentially a ticket price that varies according to how busy the restaurant is, and even some businesses that ask customers to pay what they wish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Uber, a Silicon Valley company founded four years ago, has a mobile app that connects a small army of black cars with people who need rides in 70 cities worldwide and employs ''surge pricing.'' Uber, which takes 20 percent of all fares, charges more when demand is high and the supply of cars low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You get far more cars on the road and they stay out longer when surge pricing is in effect,'' said Travis Kalanick, a co-founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You also get some cranky customers. In the last few months, the company has received an onslaught of complaints when the cost of a ride rose to as much as seven times the normal rate during a snowstorm and on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the things we've learned,'' Mr. Kalanick said, ''is that the more crisply you deliver the message to the customer and the more you set expectations ahead of time, the more you get to a place where there's no issue with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber's prices are controlled by an algorithm -- technology that is increasingly available to even the smallest enterprises. Craig Clark, for example, sells more than 2,600 items -- vintage china, bras, house numbers -- on a variety of online marketplaces. Two years ago, he was collecting $2,000 a month in revenue from his sale of house numbers on <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Six months into it, my sales went down all of the sudden,'' he said. ''Amazon went out and got a wholesale account and started selling the numbers themselves. So you're not just competing against other sellers, you're also competing against Amazon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clark had been laid off from his job as an analyst for a telecom company outside Philadelphia, so his online retail ventures had become his only source of income. Like many Amazon sellers, he started re-pricing items manually, but found the process wildly time-consuming. And mistakenly pricing a Jenga game at $13.99, instead of $23.99, once cost him $1,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, he learned of FeedVisor, which makes re-pricing software. ''You tell them what the item cost you, the commission you pay to Amazon, and your highest and lowest price,'' said Mr. Clark, whose annual revenue is approximately $500,000. ''FeedVisor then algorithmically decides the best price within your parameters and what everyone else is selling at.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, one of many that sells re-pricing software, charges 1 percent of sales and provides a dashboard that lets sellers analyze sales and profits. Using FeedVisor last summer, Mr. Clark said his ''sales on Coobie bras went up 25 percent almost overnight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FeedVisor reduced the price on the bras, which he was selling for between $19 and $23, by $2 or more to make them more competitive. That reduced his profit margin, Mr. Clark said, to 37 percent from 39 percent -- but increased his volume. The software also produced sales increases on other items of from 15 to 40 percent, he said, and helped him unload stale inventory, such as a pallet of pots and pans. ''I hadn't sold one in six months,'' said Mr. Clark, ''and I got rid of them in four days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants, too, are using innovative pricing strategies. In September 2012, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> acquired a restaurant reservation engine, Savored, and has since integrated it into a new high-end division called <span class="companylink">Groupon Reserve</span>. Instead of offering customers, say, $50 off a meal as traditional daily deals do, Savored lets restaurants offer customers a percentage off an entire meal in return for dining at a specified time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cacio e Vino, a Sicilian restaurant based in Manhattan, has been using the app for two years, said Christine Ehlert, the manager. ''On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, we offer a certain number of tables for a 40 percent discount,'' she said. Wednesday and Thursday diners may get 30 percent off through the app and customers who make reservations for between 5 and 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday get a 25 percent discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ehlert said that she initially worried whether the discounting might damage her brand. ''But since we only offer a limited amount of discounted tables at certain times,'' she said, ''I feel that we can explain to people that it's a way to drive new business to us in off hours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cacio e Vino pays <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> a flat fee of $2.50 per diner. ''The nice thing is that if it seems we're going to be too busy,'' Ms. Ehlert said, ''I can call our rep at Savored and close out the deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before using Savored, she said, the restaurant typically had $800 in sales on Mondays and Tuesdays. ''Now, it's between $1,200 and $1,500,'' she said, with a profit margin on the discounted customers that is about half that of the full-price customers. She said slightly fewer than half of the restaurant's discounted customers come back, typically for another discounted meal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank and Rhonda Duffy run Duffy Realty of Atlanta, one of a growing number of real estate agencies trying new pricing strategies. The Duffys charge an upfront listing fee of $500 and one third of 1 percent when a house sells. According to Zillow, the agency has about 800 active listings and had more than 1,400 sales in the last 12 months. Mr. Duffy said the agency's 2013 revenue was $5.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the reduced fee, the Duffys offer limited service. The firm adds homes to the local Multiple Listing Service, as well as on Zillow and <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, supplies sellers with a 60-point, do-it-yourself marketing guide, rents lockboxes for $100, and charges $94 for a home to be professionally photographed. One of the firm's four listing specialists is likely to come to take your information. Then, a team of specialists, including client services representatives, buyer's agents and contract negotiators, moves buyers and sellers through the sale process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To provide an incentive to agents from other firms to bring buyers, the Duffys encourage sellers to offer the buyer's agents commissions of 3 percent or even 4 percent. Most sellers do it, he said, because they still come out ahead. On the sale of a $300,000 home, for example, a traditional agent might split a 6 percent commission, or $18,000, with a buyer's agent. A seller listing with Duffy will pay a $1,520 commission ($500 plus one third of 1 percent, or $1,020), plus 3 percent ($9,000) or 4 percent ($12,000) for a buyer's agent, or a total of between $10,520 and $13,520.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pricing model does not suit all sellers. ''The danger is you're not getting the advice and guidance,'' said Frank S. Alexander, a real estate professor at Emory Law School. ''What do you with inspection results, or during the due diligence period, or in a contract negotiation?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For experienced sellers, or in a particularly hot market, that may not matter.</p>

Stephanie Turenko's big idea was to make an animated short film about her Ukrainian grandmother. Colin Owen's big idea was to manufacture a hard-to-steal bike light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of us have ideas like that, hatched while staring out the window or doodling on a cocktail napkin. And that's where the dream ends, stunted by a lack of capital, credibility and confidence.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not anymore. Online crowdfunding is helping better cast-iron skillets and other big ideas become reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What started as a handful of websites promoting people's pet projects has turned into hundreds of platforms that serve as vehicles for not only fund-raising -- the record is $10.2 million -- but also product development and market research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But succeeding at crowdfunding isn't as easy as raising your hand and saying you need money. It demands strategy and stamina, though a sincere appeal can still trump the slickest competitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people think if they just put their project on Kickstarter, money will start rolling in,'' said Mr. Whitehead, who used the popular Kickstarter crowdfunding platform last fall to raise $211,027. ''It's not as easy as it looks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successful crowdfunding campaigns, most often 30 days long, take several months of preparation. With the help of an industrial designer, Mr. Whitehead first spent six months developing a prototype skillet in his Portland, Ore., basement so he'd have something to show potential backers. He then spent another four months reaching out to friends and family as well as culinary, technology and design publications, alerting them to his coming Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Kickstarter is to crowdfunding what Kleenex is to tissues, there are many other highly trafficked sites that perform similar functions, like Indiegogo, RocketHub and Crowdtilt. There are also niche sites like PubSlush, which caters to aspiring authors, and <span class="companylink">Appbackr</span>, which is a home for hopeful app developers. They vary not only in the types of projects presented, but also in their fee structure, geographic coverage and whether you can keep what you raise or lose everything if you don't reach your fund-raising goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Turenko, who is from Toronto but is teaching English in Slovakia, chose RocketHub to raise money for her animated film. ''They take a higher percentage if you don't make your goal, but you do get to keep what you raise,'' she said. That's a big difference from Kickstarter, where you can lose everything if you don't make your goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd rather be allowed to take what I can get,'' Ms. Turenko said. So far, she has raised $4,066 toward a goal of $7,000 with 15 days of fund-raising remaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a growing number of private equity crowdfunding websites like Crowdfunder and <span class="companylink">CircleUp</span>, where investors can buy shares in start-ups rather than just make a donation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, equity crowdfunding is limited to wealthy, so-called accredited investors. But less moneyed investors will soon get their chance thanks to preliminary guidelines published last year as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of which platform you choose, keep in mind that people don't back projects randomly. ''The crowd is quite rational and sensitive to signals of quality,'' said Ethan Mollick, an assistant professor and crowdfunding researcher at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in the crowd are early adopters of technology and enjoy watching as a big idea turns into an actual product that they, as early backers, often receive first as a reward for their donation. Crowdfunding platforms don't like to call this preordering since there are no guarantees, but that's essentially what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't present products that are already completed and sitting on some shelf in Iowa shrink-wrapped and ready to ship,'' said the Kickstarter co-founder Yancey Strickler. ''You actually have a role in something coming to life. You know the creators and see the process from the beginning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, a clear and concise presentation of your idea through video, illustrations and text is essential. Put yourself in the place of a would-be funder scrolling through projects. You've got maybe 30 seconds to grab their attention and less than that to turn them off. There is an entire crowdfunding support system of video producers, editors and other consultants listed on sites like CrowdCrux if you need help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A single spelling error reduces chances of success by 13 percent,'' said Mr. Mollick at Wharton. Oddly, his research also indicates that mentioning how nerdy you are, and referring to Star Wars seems to help -- a clue to the type of people trolling the more popular crowdfunding sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But your audience is also venture capitalists, who view a successful crowdfunding campaign as proof that your big idea is viable and worthy of their attention. Mr. Owen said he didn't consider starting a crowdfunding campaign for his theft-resistant bicycle lights until a venture capitalist said he wouldn't consider investing until he did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt crowdfunding was like having a bake sale to fund your company,'' said Mr. Owen, who lives in San Francisco and raised $66,386 on Kickstarter in November. ''What I came to realize was it wasn't so much the money as the validation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With crowd-conveyed credibility, he was able to get a <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> loan to pay for the first production run of his lights, which 500 people on Kickstarter were promised in exchange for their financial support. Moreover, venture capitalists are now knocking on his door rather than the other way around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because he was out to demonstrate demand more than find money, Mr. Owen's crowdfunding goal of $45,000 was based on what similar projects were able to raise rather than what he actually needed to make his product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Gant and Andrew Deming, on the other hand, asked the crowd for $20,000 because that was precisely the amount required to manufacture their big idea: tote bags that unzipped into picnic blankets. They raised $25,765 on Kickstarter and now two months later they are shipping totes to their funders as promised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't go to a bank because we decided we wanted to build a community around our new company so people would be more interested and invested,'' said Ms. Gant, who lives in San Francisco. ''It was also sort of like research to see how people would react to the product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she got suggestions for colors and also learned the product appealed particularly to mothers with small children who could use it as a toy bag and play mat. ''We never would have thought of that because we aren't parents,'' she said. ''If you just got money from a bank you wouldn't have that kind of interaction with people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding experts and veterans of the process agree that such engagement with potential funders, together with a clear vision and a sincere belief in a product, are hallmarks of successful campaigns. But more than anything, your big idea has to be a good idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't have a good idea, even the slickest crowdfunding campaign won't fly,'' said Mr. Whitehead, a self-described serial entrepreneur who is currently overseeing the manufacture of the 1,550 iron skillets he presold on Kickstarter. ''You can sit through marketing classes, you can get an M.B.A., but put it out there for the crowd and you will learn the physics of bootstrapping real fast.''</p>

The title is a very apt description of what was inside. I read aloud to the entire company a section in which he talks about how writing is a series of choices until the very last second.

It's indie rock -- bass, organ and a guy with a really striking vocal. Cass McCombs is a regular for me. He has a song called ''County Line,'' which is like the saddest song ever produced in the 1970s, except it was recorded in 2013. And I love reggae.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Marilyn Arnold was 9 years old, her mother, a skilled seamstress, patiently taught her to sew on a vintage Singer treadle sewing machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As her feet pumped away at the machine in her family's farmhouse near Paris, Mo., she was smitten. ''I was in love with sewing, even when I stuck my finger and it bled,'' Ms. Arnold said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon she was whirling the thread for crisp white blouses with bright red sailor collars, gathered skirts, and, in time, her entire school wardrobe. She even competed in sewing contests at the Missouri State Fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she never dreamed that now, at the age of 66, she would be running her own small business, Marilyn Arnold Designs, in Lee's Summit, Mo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her specialty is custom designing and sewing 18-inch-by-18-inch pillows, christening dresses and blankets as mementos made from cherished wedding gowns that had been relegated to the back of a closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also stitches quilts big enough for a queen-size bed assembled from beloved T-shirts, and patches together vests from timeworn scarves. ''Everything I make is from repurposed materials,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea for her venture took root three years ago, shortly before she retired from her position as a managing partner at the <span class="companylink">New York Life Insurance Company</span>, after 29 years in the insurance business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was when her accountant asked her what she planned to do in retirement. She acknowledged that she knew she had to do something, but had no idea what. The accountant asked a second question: ''What did you want to do when you were a little girl?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While her childhood dream was to become a dress designer, that endeavor seemed too lofty a goal at her age. The idea to design and sew custom pillows from a wedding dress was inspired by a friend's request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the manageable beginning of a new career. Her start-up costs to buy equipment and supplies and to devise a marketing plan tallied $12,000, financed from personal savings, Ms. Arnold said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, she sewed as a side job for several months before she retired to see if there was really enough interest to introduce a full-fledged business. In time, she created a website, opened an online web storefront on Etsy, and began posting her designs on <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, she handles all the sewing duties herself, easily clocking in 12-hour days. ''My biggest challenge has been balancing my time in order to work on all aspects of my business,'' Ms. Arnold said. ''I have to guard against spending too much time working in my business and not enough time working on my business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older American entrepreneurs like Ms. Arnold are on a roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kimberly Palmer, author of ''The Economy of You: Discover Your Inner Entrepreneur and Recession-Proof Your Life,'' said she had noticed that the most eager audience for the book was often people approaching retirement, or already in it. ''They want to leverage their skills and experience into something entrepreneurial,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a recent study published by the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span> and Legal Zoom, in 2013, about 20 percent of all new businesses were started by entrepreneurs aged 50 to 59 years, and 15 percent were 60 and over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, in fact, over the last decade, the highest rate of entrepreneurial activity belongs to those in the 55-to-64 age group, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A desire to work for oneself and create a business that is meaningful and has social impact at this stage of life, combined with a job market that makes it tough for workers over 50 to get hired, has clearly pushed more people to pursue the entrepreneurial path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the longest time we've assumed that social entrepreneurship was the exclusive provenance of young people,'' said Marc Freedman, founder and chief executive of Encore.org, the nonprofit research center dedicated to second acts for the greater good. ''Now we're realizing an undiscovered continent of innovation in the growing population over 50.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is not an easy road. Money is the biggest stumbling block. Most start-ups like Ms. Arnold's are underwritten with personal savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If someone does not have a nice stockpile of savings to tap, or a partner who is still bringing home a paycheck, it is tough to get going. And many entrepreneurs do not pay themselves for a year or so to allow their businesses to gain traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To finance the more than $100,000 it took to start Well Read New &amp; Used Books in Hawthorne, N.J., about three years ago, for example, Bill Skees, then 56, asked his six siblings for a loan, and he and his wife, Mary Ann, were able to dip into savings for the rest. The banks he contacted were not enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's lots of red tape, and most banks aren't interested in financing a senior business start-up, which generally runs between $10,000 to $25,000, because it's too small,'' said Elizabeth Isele, 71, co-founder of SeniorEntrepreneurshipWorks.org, a nonprofit venture geared to helping workers over age 50 start their own businesses. ''And age bias can be a big factor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, many small and microbusinesses, particularly freelance, home-based and online e-commerce businesses, require only a fraction of that to get going, sometimes under $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where there's a will, there's a way. Determined older entrepreneurs have tapped retirement accounts, tracked down hard-to-get economic development loans in their communities and turned to crowdfunding sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Senate hearing titled ''In Search of a Second Act: The Challenges and Advantages of Senior Entrepreneurship,'' scheduled for next Wednesday, will offer a chance to air issues like age bias from lending organizations and the need to develop tax incentives for training and start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In order to continue our economic recovery, we need to change how we view the terms 'start-up' or 'entrepreneur,' '' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most people associate those terms with a tech business and a young computer whiz, not a home business in a rural town and a seasoned executive with 30 years of management experience,'' Senator Landrieu said. ''Senior entrepreneurs are especially critical to creating jobs and growing the economy, because they have the right experience and resources to be successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Isele, who plans to testify at the hearing, said she and others would argue that this growing demographic group would not cause a crisis. ''We need to help people in policy and private industry to understand, this isn't a silver tsunami,'' she said. ''It's a silver lining, yielding golden dividends. Senior entrepreneurs contribute to the economy, paying taxes, creating jobs, paying people and underwriting entitlement programs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Landrieu said she hoped the hearing would showcase successful initiatives and discuss whether they could be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One innovative initiative is the eProv Studio, which will officially start this weekend at the Institute for the Ages' Conference on Positive Aging in Sarasota, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new workshops, created by Ms. Isele and Cheryl Kiser, executive director of the Lewis Institute at <span class="companylink">Babson College</span>, combine the methodology of entrepreneurial thought and action and the techniques of improvisational theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each participant comes to the workshop with a desire, an itch, an idea of what they might want to do,'' Ms. Kiser added. ''The method we teach in these groups of 20 is to look at who you are, what you know, who you know, what you can do and the resources you have at hand to create something of value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the improv process can help decode someone's entrepreneurial history. ''We help them understand decade by decade what they have accomplished and see a pattern of these accomplishments and entrepreneurial skills they have had throughout their entire life,'' Ms. Isele said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other resources include a free, online, open-source entrepreneurship curriculum, hosted at the Lawrence N. Field Center for Entrepreneurship at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College. It is intended for people over 50 and includes help with developing business plans, obtaining loans, gaining and access to business start-up incubators and meeting mentors to serve as sounding boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span>'s FastTrac Boomer Entrepreneur program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In collaboration with AARP and FastTrac affiliates in select American cities, Kauffman is piloting specialized 10-week courses in both English and Spanish. Up to 20 applicants will be accepted in each course. The next course is scheduled to run from Feb. 24 to April 28 in Irvine, Calif., in conjunction with the nonprofit Tech Coast Venture Network Irvine. The cost is $200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while many older Americans are new to learning business skills, some cherish the personal rewards discovered along the way. ''My business has given me so many things, but what I love the most is that I'm my own boss,'' Ms. Arnold said. ''I manage my time.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ads ran for years. The global charity <span class="companylink">Save the Children</span> asked for a monthly donation, and in return, a few times a year the donors received a photo and handwritten note or drawing from children in impoverished places like Haiti.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, of course, was that donors would have some sort of connection to the contribution. Most people knew that, in reality, the few dollars were not given directly to those children but to projects that would supposedly benefit them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays, if people want to offer a similar gift, they can go to any number of crowdfunding sites where lots of small donors give money to a project or venture -- like Fundly.com, Indiegogo.com, CrowdRise.com or GoFundMe.com -- and bypass the middleman altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On those sites, which usually make their money by taking a percentage of the funds raised, people with sympathetic stories seek sponsors -- a young girl who needs a stem-cell treatment, a woman who wants money to adopt a child or a classroom of low-income students who want to visit Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But crowdfunding raises questions. If young people give to these single-issue causes, is there less likelihood they will donate to the legacy charities such as the Red Cross, United Way and, yes, <span class="companylink">Save the Children</span>? Does the individual and direct nature of crowdfunding act as a spur or a drain to such longtime nonprofits?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crowdfunding is particularly attractive to younger donors who are looking for a more direct connection to the causes and people they're supporting,'' said Katherina M. Rosqueta, executive director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>. ''I think of it as a tool, one which might bring stories and issues to particular donors who wouldn't otherwise be aware and prompt them to give.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a direct connection doesn't necessarily mean it is more effective. Ms. Rosqueta says the bigger, more established charities play a role that crowdfunding does not. These organizations ''bring deep experience and knowledge to their area,'' she said. ''They've had to measure and manage their own results for donors. People might feel a more direct connection in crowdfunding, but it doesn't mean it's doing the most good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money raised in crowdfunding -- about $1.6 billion nationally and $2.7 billion worldwide in 2012, according to the research company Massolution -- is minuscule compared with the approximately $300 billion raised by nonprofits in this country alone, according to Giving USA, the annual report of charitable donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nonprofits' figure isn't growing. Since the 1970s, charitable donations have made up about 2 percent of the gross domestic product and Americans, on average, give 2 percent of their gross income to charities -- including universities and religious institutions. That comes to about $1,500 a year per household.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donation and reward-based crowdfunding, which is growing off a decidedly lower base, increased by more than 85 percent worldwide in 2012 over the previous year, according to MassolutionChristin Putnam of Larchmont, N.Y., discovered crowdfunding when someone she knew asked for support for a project, which is typical of many crowdfunding donors. ''I give to projects that appeal to me on a personal level,'' said Ms. Putnam. Her donations, she said, ''reflect my own quirky interests. For example, I have funded history books and maps for a classroom, organic seeds for a school classroom, a film about bullying and Jewish community project in the town of Auschwitz.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Putnam said that she still supported traditional philanthropies ''because I agree with their mission and have longstanding ties,'' but said that giving to sites like donorchoose.org, which is for teachers, is more fun ''and more like an impulse buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research shows that impulse donating is common on crowdfunding sites, said Gregory Saxton, director of the Graduate Studies at the Department of Communication at the <span class="companylink">State University of New York</span>, Buffalo. But, he said, research also shows that many donors don't seem to particularly care whether or not a project they support is financially effective. Rather, they are swayed by attention-getting videos and sentimental stories rather than the depth of the need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charities have long used heart-rending photos, tear-jerking songs or poignant tales to attract donors. In an early version of crowdfunding, the newspaper magnate Joseph Pulitzer said in 1885 that he would print the name of every person who donated to the construction of a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty on the front page of his newspaper and would also print human interest stories sent along with the donations. Soon, more than 120,000 people had donated $100,000 -- $2.3 million in current dollars -- enough to pay for the pedestal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pulitzer may not have realized that he was combining the very ingredients that Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo.com, says inspires people to donate to crowdfunding: passion for the project, trust in the person behind it, involvement in something bigger than oneself and the receipt of a perk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The traditional charities have not ignored the potential of crowdfunding. Ettore Rossetti, director of digital marketing and social media for <span class="companylink">Save the Children</span>, said his organization had benefited from several crowdfunding appeals, and had also started some of its own campaigns. ''The way charities used to be run was on brand loyalty,'' he said. ''That's not so true anymore. There's a risk, if you're not nimble and don't participate in new media, you can absolutely be left behind. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Rossetti also expressed concern that some people believed crowdfunding causes were better because they appeared to more directly help those in need. ''I think crowdfunding is good, but there is the risk of being beholden to the whim of popularity,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are worried about the tendency of crowdfunding to dismiss overhead and administrative costs as needless bureaucracy, without realizing the complicated causes that large charities address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A very simplistic project can be great, but if it becomes the sole means people give, we're going to end up addressing a much narrower set of social problems,'' said Ken Berger, president of Charity Navigator, which monitors nonprofits. ''Take homelessness. It's not a simple story. We can't only focus on one aspect like job training or affordable housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ringelmann of Indiegogo doesn't see a conflict. She says sites like hers can work with and help push traditional charities to be more transparent in how their money is spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question will be if, like Ms. Putnam, most donors are willing to give to both traditional charities and crowdfunding. ''We need traditional charities such as museums and universities because they are essential to our society,'' she said, ''but we also need to support people outside the mainstream.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nine years in Brooklyn, the Chocolate Room -- a popular purveyor of wine, cake, candy and coffee -- experienced one of those cataclysmic events retailers fear: a crippling rise in rent. Informed in late 2012 that they would face an increase of more than 500 percent, the cafe's owners, Naomi Josepher and Jon Payson, reluctantly decided to abandon their space and begin figuring out how to finance a $200,000 relocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are still paying off private and family loans for their start-up costs. So Ms. Josepher and Mr. Payson took a suggestion from their customers and started a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Word spread quickly, and by the third day, the shop had more than $1,000 pledged toward its goal of $40,000.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the resistance began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's something about asking your customers to help fund your expansion that just feels a little ... wrong,'' posted a commenter on one community website. ''Cool or not cool?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NOT COOL,'' came the overwhelming verdict. The Chocolate Room had unwittingly stepped into a fiery debate about the ethics and etiquette of crowdfunding. As financing platforms grow more prevalent on the web, it is easier than ever for merchants to solicit funds from customers -- but is it a good idea?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travail Kitchen &amp; Amusements, a restaurant in a Minneapolis suburb with a cultlike following, became a prime example of these concerns when it completed an immensely successful Kickstarter campaign in October. Seeking $75,000 for a relocation and expansion, Travail netted almost twice that amount in 24 hours. The monthlong drive eventually brought in more than $255,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't get it,'' a local columnist, Jon Tevlin, wrote in The Star Tribune. Why, he asked, were so many people willing to subsidize a for-profit business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money raised through sites like Kickstarter is essentially a donation. Creators seek funds for a specific project and typically offer goods or services in return, but those who back the project receive no stake in the enterprise. Congress legislated ''equity crowdfunding'' in 2012, but the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> is still drafting the rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tevlin said his column drew a mixed response. While many agreed with his skeptical take, younger readers tended to have a different view. ''They saw it as a contribution to the local culture, almost like giving to the local art institute,'' he said. ''It's not how I would choose to spend my money. If I give to a start-up restaurant, I would expect stock or a cut of the proceeds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynette E. Krajewski started a fund-raising campaign in September to open Community Oven, a bakery and pizza shop in Rockland, Me. Her previous restaurant, which closed in 2011, had been financed through bank loans and $200,000 of her family's savings. Reluctant to assume more debt, she and her husband took a ''crowdfunding or bust'' approach to Community Oven: If the project did not hit its goal, the shop wouldn't open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign drew donations of more than $8,000 from former customers, employees, friends and supporters. It also attracted hate mail. ''I got some pretty irate messages from people saying, 'You shouldn't be doing this, you're asking for handouts,' '' said Ms. Krajewski, who came up short of the $50,000 she sought and did not move forward with the restaurant. ''We would not try a Kickstarter campaign again. It was very emotional.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Steinberg, the author of ''The Kickstarter Handbook: Real-Life Success Stories of Artists, Inventors and Entrepreneurs,'' said he saw a parallel between what some business owners experienced and the blowback against recent celebrity-led crowdfunding campaigns. Yes, Spike Lee raised $1.4 million for a new film, but dozens of other star-studded projects sank. Zosia Mamet, a star of ''Girls,'' failed to raise $32,000 to finance a music video.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the same thing, wondering whether established enterprises really should be asking for money this way,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''They aren't struggling artists or inventors trying to get started. It seems to defy the spirit -- and the name -- of Kickstarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem, entrepreneurs say, is the perception that local businesses are more financially successful than they really are. ''We are doing very well,'' said Ms. Josepher of the Chocolate Room, ''but like most small businesses, we carry heavy debt. After 10 years, we're still paying other employees more than we pay ourselves. We don't have a huge cushion to dive into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travail opened three years ago in Robbinsdale, Minn., with just $2,000 in the bank and a lot of improvisation, said Megan Leafblad, the restaurant's director of business development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion will cost more than $1.4 million. Subsidized financing from a local economic development authority brought in $300,000; most of the rest is coming from loans and the owners' personal funds. Keeping dining prices low is a priority, and every dollar Travail borrows cuts into its flexibility to do that, Ms. Leafblad said. That is why Kickstarter seemed attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But money raised through the site does not come free. Kickstarter takes 5 percent of the total as its cut, and credit card processing fees consume another 3 to 5 percent. And those who pledge money are typically rewarded with discounts or gifts. For example, a $100 pledge to Travail's campaign earned the backer a ticket for a free dinner, a calendar and a handful of other perks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the reasons we went with Kickstarter is that their mission is about funding creative projects,'' Ms. Leafblad said. ''We approached it as a community-engagement tool. Yes, you're looking for money, but you're also looking to build a community around your idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of the campaigns on Kickstarter fail to reach their goal. When that happens, all pledges are canceled. That is how the Chocolate Room's campaign ended in November. It drew pledges of $9,647 from 63 backers but fell far short of its target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Ms. Josepher, who said she had no regrets about trying Kickstarter, landed a loan from a private investor to cover some of the relocation costs. The rest will come from credit cards or whatever other sources she can find. The shop's original location, on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, shut down when its lease expired at the end of January. Its replacement is under construction less than a block away. (A second cafe, in Cobble Hill, remains in operation.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some crowdfunding sites, like RocketHub, FoodStart and Indiegogo, allow project creators to keep the money they raise even if they do not reach their goal. That helped Krazy Jim's Blimpyburger, a 60-year-old restaurant in Ann Arbor, Mich., that lost its lease last year when its landlord sold the lot. The family-owned business, which closed in August, is scrambling to piece together the $330,000 it needs to relocate and reopen this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Magner helped her parents organize several fund-raising projects, including an Indiegogo campaign. ''I think people who value Blimpyburger see it as more than a for-profit business,'' she said. ''It is an Ann Arbor tradition for many, and we just want to keep it going.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right before it closed, Blimpyburger hosted a $100 fund-raising dinner to say farewell to its original restaurant. Those who showed up were delighted to share stories and memories, Ms. Magner said, although some critics mocked the idea of a $100 fast-food meal and chided the family for soliciting donations. Local news coverage of Blimpyburger's fund-raiser drew hundreds of comments, many of them vicious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restaurant's Indiegogo drive, which ended last month, brought in $20,396 of its $60,000 goal. Ms. Magner said her family considers that a success: ''Each of the 462 contributions was a vote of support.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going abroad for cheap labor isn't just for big businesses anymore. Thanks to the rise of online job marketplaces, small businesses are increasingly using foreign contract workers to lower their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a trend that has the potential to redistribute global wealth, say a group of researchers in a recent working paper published by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span>.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For businesses hiring people for one-time projects in areas like software development, website design, customer service and translation, there is no longer a need to stay local. A company in New York can arrange for someone in Uzbekistan to create its website, for example. And chances are that the Uzbek worker will be willing to work for much less pay than a comparable one in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But finding those people and dealing with payment isn't something that a typical business has time to handle. That's where online marketplaces like <span class="companylink">oDesk</span>, Elance (which recently merged with <span class="companylink">oDesk</span>), Freelancer and Guru come in. They post workers' skills and portfolios, solicit and publish reviews, and arrange for payment, taking a cut of each transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ODesk</span> created its online marketplace in 2005, and the company has grown quickly since then. The number of employers billing on the site per quarter rose by more than 900 percent from 2009 to 2013; in that same period, the number of working freelancers per quarter rose about 1,000 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity on these sites consists mainly of companies in high-income countries hiring workers in low-income ones, said Ajay Agrawal, a professor of entrepreneurship at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> and one of the authors of the study. Contractors in low-income countries with the right skills can receive a substantial wage boost by participating in an online marketplace, he said. ''They can go on the platform and see which jobs are in most demand and learn those skills.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contractors from Bangladesh and the Philippines, for example, ''earn significantly more than local minimum wages, perhaps partly explaining their disproportionate use of the platform,'' according to the paper. Technology skills tend to command higher wages. On average, software developers were able to make around $16 an hour, whereas administrative support paid $4, the paper said. (Projects can also be performed at a fixed rate instead of an hourly one.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But might an American business hesitate to hire someone halfway across the globe -- especially in a non-English-speaking country? The quality of work produced will always be an issue for online marketplaces, wherever the workers are based. That's why the ratings and reviews on the sites are so important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Pallais, an assistant professor of economics and social studies at Harvard, ran an experiment involving <span class="companylink">oDesk</span> transactions. It showed that on average, contractors who had ratings with their profiles greatly increased their earnings and rates of employment. (This was the case even though negative ratings were included in the averages.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The digital outsourcing of contract work is ''good for American small business -- that's who's really using this,'' Professor Agrawal said. It's also helping to raise the standard of living for workers in developing countries. The rise of these marketplaces will increase global productivity by encouraging ''better matching between employers and employees,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend isn't so good for freelancers in the United States and other high-income countries, who can't compete against a contractor in, say, the Philippines, who bids $5 an hour for a tech-related job. It's similar to the effect that occurred when American companies began outsourcing their work to factories abroad -- and one that is likely to be debated as online labor continues to grow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that such heart-wrenching cases are actually quite rare, but you'd be wrong: they aren't rare; they're nonexistent. In particular, nobody has ever come up with a real modern example of a family farm sold to meet estate taxes. The whole ''death tax'' campaign has rested on eliciting human sympathy for purely imaginary victims.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now they're trying a similar campaign against health reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not sure whether conservatives realize yet that their Plan A on health reform -- wait for Obamacare's inevitable collapse, and reap the political rewards -- isn't working. But it isn't. Enrollments have recovered strongly from the law's disastrous start-up; in California, which had a working website from the beginning, enrollment has already exceeded first-year projections. The mix of people signed up so far is older than planners had hoped, but not enough so to cause big premium hikes, let alone the often-predicted ''death spiral.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And conservatives don't really have a Plan B -- in their world, nobody even dares mention the possibility that health reform might actually prove workable. Still, you can already see some on the right groping toward a new strategy, one that relies on highlighting examples of the terrible harm Obamacare does. There's only one problem: they haven't managed to come up with any real examples. Consider several recent ventures on the right:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; In the official G.O.P. response to the State of the Union address, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers alluded to the case of ''Bette in Spokane,'' who supposedly lost her good health insurance coverage and was forced to pay nearly $700 more a month in premiums. Local reporters located the real Bette, and found that the story was completely misleading: her original policy provided very little protection, and she could get a much better plan for much less than the claimed cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; In Louisiana, the AstroTurf (fake grass-roots) group <span class="companylink">Americans for Prosperity</span> -- the group appears to be largely financed and controlled by the Koch brothers and other wealthy donors -- has been running ads targeting Senator Mary Landrieu. In these ads, we see what appear to be ordinary Louisiana residents receiving notices telling them that their insurance policies have been canceled because of Obamacare. But the people in the ads are, in fact, paid actors, and the scenes they play aren't re-enactments of real events -- they're ''emblematic,'' says a spokesman for the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; In Michigan, <span class="companylink">Americans for Prosperity</span> is running an ad that does feature a real person. But is she telling a real story? In the ad, Julia Boonstra, who is suffering from leukemia, declares that her insurance has been canceled, that the new policy will have unaffordable out-of-pocket costs, and that ''If I do not receive my medication, I will die.'' But Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post tried to check the facts, and learned that thanks to lower premiums she will almost surely save nearly as much if not more than she will be paying in higher out-of-pocket costs. A spokesman for <span class="companylink">Americans for Prosperity</span> responded to questions about the numbers with bluster and double-talk -- this is about ''a real person suffering from blood cancer, not some neat and tidy White House PowerPoint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even supporters of health reform are somewhat surprised by the right's apparent inability to come up with real cases of hardship. Surely there must be some people somewhere actually being hurt by a reform that affects millions of Americans. Why can't the right find these people and exploit them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most likely answer is that the true losers from Obamacare generally aren't very sympathetic. For the most part, they're either very affluent people affected by the special taxes that help finance reform, or at least moderately well-off young men in very good health who can no longer buy cheap, minimalist plans. Neither group would play well in tear-jerker ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, what the right wants are struggling average Americans, preferably women, facing financial devastation from health reform. So those are the tales they're telling, even though they haven't been able to come up with any real examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey, I have a suggestion: Why not have ads in which actors play Americans who have both lost their insurance thanks to Obamacare and lost the family farm to the death tax? I mean, once you're just making stuff up, anything goes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recently wrote about the backlash some retailers, including the Chocolate Room, have experienced while trying to raise money through crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> has yet to approve the final rules for ''equity crowdfunding,'' the money raised through sites like Kickstarter is essentially a donation. Creators seek funds for a specific project and typically offer goods or services in return, but those who back the project receive no stake in the enterprise. And not everyone thinks for-profit businesses should take donations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several readers of the article offered feedback and advice about what merchants can do to improve their chances of success, as did the retailers I spoke with for the story. Below are some lessons they learned while running their campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offer something compelling for the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One commenter had this to say about the Chocolate Room's campaign: ''The only thing they did wrong was not making the reward for pledging at the high end a bit more enticing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a tricky balancing act, the merchants said. The whole point is to raise money -- to finance an expansion, a renovation or a new business -- and every dollar spent fulfilling rewards is one less dollar that goes toward that goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naomi Josepher and Jon Payson, owners of the Chocolate Room, treated the rewards they offered as a small thank-you for what they viewed as a donation. A $200 pledge, for example, earned a reward of a dessert and coffee for two, a combo with a retail value in their cafe of around $25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach can make for a pretty hard sell. In retrospect, Ms. Josepher said, her campaign might have been more successful with a more generous rewards structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of Macaron Parlour, a confections store in Manhattan, recently ran a Kickstarter campaign that brought in $15,000 toward the cost of opening a second store. Christina Ha, one of the cafe's owners, said they sought to align the rewards with their retail cost. ''We viewed it more as prepaying,'' she said. A $40 donation bought a punch card good for 10 drinks; a $70 pledge earned 30 macaroons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creative rewards can be cost-effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What crowdfunding backers like best, the merchants said, is getting access to something special, something unavailable to the general public. This can either be fairly simple -- Macaron Parlour offered those who donated $25 a box of macaroons with four custom flavors -- or elaborate, like the special cooking class that the restaurant Travail Kitchen &amp; Amusements offered its $500 backers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to offer experiences,'' said Megan Leafblad, the restaurant's director of business development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real sweet spot is coming up with rewards that have little cost for the retailer but great value to potential backers. Travail doesn't take reservations, and getting in can require well over an hour's wait in line. For $250, Travail offered backers the chance to jump the line twice in 2014 and take a spot immediately. For some, this was a priceless offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parties, such as a launch party exclusively for backers, can be another popular perk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time your campaign carefully and publicize it heavily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A track record and an established fan base can be critical to a successful crowdfunding campaign, which is why brand-new businesses often fail. ''One thing that made our campaign really successful is that we have a lot of fans, and we're not a new restaurant,'' Ms. Leafblad said. ''We have 10,000 <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> fans. It was pretty easy to get the word out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a loyal local following and a national reputation, Travail was well positioned. For lower-profile businesses, social media and marketing prowess can help. Indiegogo, the crowdfunding site, recommends in its advice guide that project organizers start off with a go-to pool of backers: ''The first 25 percent of your goal should come from your closest friends, family and fans.'' Until a business has that core audience, it may be too soon to run a campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Play up your community connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When local stores like this close, people always say, 'Oh, I had no idea they were doing so poorly/I wish I had shopped there more,''' one reader commented on the recent article. ''A campaign like this could be a good way of getting the word out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People often take local merchants for granted until they disappear. A crowdfunding campaign can be an opportunity to explain and illustrate the role a neighborhood business plays in its local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynette Krajewski ran an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign to finance Community Oven, a planned pizzeria in Rockland, Me. Ms. Krajewski's first restaurant, Lily Bistro, closed in 2011, and when it did, 20 people lost their jobs. That's what she says she regrets the most about not being able to finance a new restaurant in Rockland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are not enough jobs in Maine,'' said Ms. Krajewski, who is now living and working in Massachusetts. ''We explained to people, 'We want to work with local farmers, buy from local businesses, and hire local workers. There's a whole trickle-down of things we would support in the local economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that can be a hard message to get out. Interestingly, those who are most inclined to respond sometimes turn out to be fellow business owners. Ms. Josepher said that was an unexpected upside to her failed Kickstarter campaign: Other local merchants got in touch to offer the Chocolate Room aid, advice, connections, and moral support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Amazing people came to our door,'' she said, rattling off a list of those who pitched in. One nearby business owner connected her with local bankers he had worked with; another offered a real estate tip that led to a pop-up space where the Chocolate Room set up a temporary storefront to bridge the gap until the new cafe opens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've gotten so much support from the community because of the Kickstarter,'' Ms. Josepher said. ''That alone made it worth it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new report from the federal government that says more small employers will see premiums increase than fall under the Affordable Care Act appears to have put the Obama administration on the defensive once again. But the report is remarkable as much for what it reveals about the current state of the small-group market as for how it might look under Obamacare, as the law is commonly known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was produced by the <span class="companylink">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</span> at the request of Congress, and it is largely an exercise in the theoretical. The Affordable Care Act outlaws premium discrimination based on a company's industry, the size of its group, or the health status and gender of its employees. The law also limits premium variation based on age, and the study assumes that when all these rules eventually take effect, all small companies and their workers will pay essentially the same rates.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the agency estimates that today, under the current rules, two-thirds of small employers pay premiums that are below the average rate and one-third pay above-average premiums. Therefore, under an Affordable Care Act that is fully in place, two-thirds will see their premiums rise, and one-third will see premiums fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, we have long known that some people would pay more for health insurance under Obamacare and some people would pay less. What is interesting is the skew: Why is it that two-thirds of employers, and employees, according to the study, have paid below-average premiums? Why isn't it closer to 50/50? The answer, according to the study, is that under the old system, companies that paid lower premiums because their employees posed smaller health risks were more likely to offer health insurance in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at M.I.T. whose work was cited in the C.M.S. report, those companies' premiums were not as far below the average as the premiums of those businesses that insured older, less healthy employees were above the average. ''The most expensive firms are very expensive, while the cheaper ones aren't that much cheaper,'' Mr. Gruber said. ''So what that means is that while the cheaper firms will lose, they will lose by less than the most expensive firms gain. The 65/35 is still consistent with the overall roughly net zero result that the <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span>, myself, and others have estimated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also possible that companies that have not provided health insurance because it was too expensive may now be offered rates lower than what they were quoted in the past. The report estimates 18 million people get insurance through the small-group market, though not all will be affected by the new premium rules one way or the other. But according to the most recent figures from the Census Bureau, about 31 million people work for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. That means the current market leaves about 42 percent of small-business employees uninsured, and some of those would most likely find small-group insurance more affordable under the new rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report did not quantify how much premiums would rise or fall. And it acknowledged that Congress asked the agency to study only three of the law's provisions and that other aspects of the law could affect how premiums change. ''The impact could vary significantly depending on the mix of firms that decide to offer health insurance coverage,'' the study said. ''In reality, the employers' decisions to offer coverage will be based on far more factors than the three that are focused on in this report.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans in Congress took the opportunity presented by the report to attack the law. Representative Sam Graves, the Republican from Missouri who heads the <span class="companylink">House Small Business Committee</span>, called it ''one more in a long line of broken promises from President Obama and Washington Democrats.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiously, the Obama administration seemed restrained in its response, choosing not to address the new study directly. When asked for a comment, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Joanne Peters, said only, ''Since the Affordable Care Act became law, health care costs have been growing at the slowest rates on record and premiums are growing at less than one-half the pace seen a decade ago. The law is making it easier for businesses to offer coverage, just like it did in Massachusetts when employer coverage increased after reform passed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Daschle, the former Democratic majority leader in the Senate and President Obama's first nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, bemoaned what he said was an increasingly one-sided debate. ''There are so many ways to look at this,'' said Mr. Daschle, who is now a senior policy adviser to the law firm <span class="companylink">DLA Piper</span>, of the C.M.S. report. For one thing, he said, the tax credits available to very small businesses that offer insurance will ''change tremendously the way premiums are paid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on to question why the administration had not responded more forcefully. ''I think it's been a big mistake that we're not pushing back as hard as we can,'' he said. ''There's an old saying attributed to Winston Churchill: a rumor gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its shoes on. That has happened over and over again with the Affordable Care Act.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUMBAI, India -- The opposition party's candidate for prime minister, Narendra Modi, laid out a broad economic policy for India on Thursday that encouraged family-owned businesses to embrace competition in a country known for its protectionist policies and endorsed a goods and services tax, which his state government had previously opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at a gathering of the Confederation of All India Traders in New Delhi, Mr. Modi, who has been a vocal supporter of small business in the past, said small traders should adapt to a changed marketplace by improving the quality of their goods so they could work with large online retailers, rather than fear the e-commerce market.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should not worry about the challenges from global trade,'' Mr. Modi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Modi refrained from clarifying his stand on direct foreign investment in e-commerce and multibrand retail markets, a traditionally sensitive political issue. His party, Bharatiya Janata, has been hostile toward New Delhi's efforts to allow foreign multibrand retailers like <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> to open stores in India, which they said would threaten the livelihoods of millions of small store owners who form the backbone of the party's support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he emphasized that the Ministry of External Affairs should engage in ''economic diplomacy'' to help hasten India's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Modi, who has presented himself as a business-friendly candidate, and his party are the front-runners in the national elections in May, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, and analysts said his first extensive comments on national economic policy reflected a strong pragmatism that will be required of India's leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satish Mishra, a senior fellow specializing in politics and governance at the Observer Research Foundation, a policy group in Mumbai, said that although Mr. Modi did not mention them, he was aiming his remarks at foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Narendra Modi is trying to send a positive message to foreign investors and those who want economic growth at all costs, while balancing the interests of small-business owners that have traditionally supported the B.J.P.,'' he said. ''He is preparing the ground for a shift away from opposition of foreign retail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Bharatiya Janata Party has traditionally been a staunch supporter of small traders, analysts said it was clear that Mr. Modi was trying to attract big businesses as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From a pragmatic perspective, he has to take decisions in the broader national interests if he is talking as a prime ministerial candidate,'' said Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director of institutional equity at AnandRathi Financial Services in Mumbai. ''He cannot be opposed to big-format organized domestic retail and e-commerce, because that is the reality today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the day, during a speech at the India Economic Convention, Mr. Modi said he favored a nationwide goods and services tax, which would replace a fragmented system of state and central government taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attempts by the national government to introduce a goods and services tax have long been thwarted by opposition from India's states, including Gujarat, where Mr. Modi is chief minister. In October, Gujarat railed against New Delhi's attempts to pass the goods and services tax through a bill, saying that the state feared revenue losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his official <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed, he denied that his party had ever opposed the tax itself, only New Delhi's lack of adequate information technology infrastructure to support it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said Mr. Modi's remarks were made by a politician thinking from the standpoint of the country, which would benefit from the increased revenue from such a tax, rather than as a chief minister in charge of a state government, which would lose revenue n the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Narendra Modi was a politician in the opposition, and he was trying to make things difficult for the Congress, who was in any case having great difficulty in passing the G.S.T.,'' said Surendra Laxminarayan Rao, an economist who was the former director general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He is no longer talking as the chief minister of a Bharatiya Janata Party state, representing the viewpoint of the party,'' Mr. Rao said. ''He is talking as if he's the prime minister of India.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivan Rincon's products may have been skimpy, but he was convinced his growth prospects were not. Orchid Boutique, the online swimwear shop he founded six years ago in Miami with his wife, Mayra, was approaching $3 million in annual sales. It had been profitable since 2010, he said, with margins that ran between 10 and 15 percent. But the business was highly seasonal, leaving him scrambling for cash in the off-season when he needed to place orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with an executive coach in 2012, Mr. Rincon developed a plan to diversify the store's offerings beyond swimwear and tap into promising markets like Australia and Europe. To execute the plan, he needed to stock up on jewelry and other accessories, and he needed to hire more employees -- all of which would require money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rincon first sought a bank loan but was rejected for lack of collateral. Then he did what many small-business owners have done since the recession: He turned to a merchant cash advance provider, a type of nonbank lender that advances cash quickly in return for a share of future sales, extracted daily from the borrower's credit card receipts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2012, Mr. Rincon got a merchant cash advance of $200,000, for which he agreed to pay $55,000. The lender took 15 percent of his sales daily until it had recouped the $255,000 -- at an effective annual interest rate of more than 50 percent. Mr. Rincon paid off the advance last May with the proceeds from another merchant cash advance, this one for $70,000 at a 15 percent annual rate, not including other fees. In retrospect, Mr. Rincon said, taking the cash advances ''wasn't the healthiest thing to do for the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he heard about Dealstruck, a year-old company based in San Diego. In October 2013, Mr. Rincon shared his financials with Dealstruck, and a few days later, he came away with a $250,000 loan that featured a three-year term, a 10 percent annual interest rate, and flexible terms that allow him to make bigger payments in busy months. ''The terms are clear and include a set monthly fee and a reasonable payback time frame,'' Mr. Rincon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealstruck is among a new crop of alternative lenders -- including Fundation and Funding Circle -- offering a middle path between banks, which lend primarily to the most creditworthy small businesses, and cash advance lenders, which thrive on subprime candidates. The new lenders, according to Sam Graziano, Fundation's chief executive, focus on ''midprime'' businesses that ''deserve a better product but don't qualify for a bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternative lending has filled a gap left by risk-averse banks: big banks approved less than a fifth of all requests for small-business loans they received in January, while small banks approved about half of such requests, according to a survey by Biz2Credit, an online platform that matches businesses and lenders. And that does not reflect the businesses that are too discouraged to apply. By embracing technology to make small-business lending more efficient and profitable, the alternative lenders have opened opportunities for businesses. In January, according to Biz2Credit, alternative lenders approved roughly 64 percent of the loan requests they received.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Internet is doing to this industry what it's done to every other industry -- create efficiencies, competition and price transparency,'' said Jared Hecht, chief executive of Fundera, another website that matches businesses with lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first wave of tech-based alternative lenders -- companies like <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> and Kabbage, which opened in 2007 and 2011 -- used innovative software and data metrics, including social media interactions and Yelp reviews, to assess the health of a business. <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> alone has underwritten more than $900 million in loans. And Kabbage, which targets online merchants, lent $200 million in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these loans typically are similar to a cash advance, with a fixed amount or percent of sales deducted daily from the borrower's bank account over several months. Given the short loan terms, a small-business borrower can end up paying 50 percent or more on an annualized basis without realizing it. Those rates, however, have made it easy for <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> and Kabbage to line up institutional investors looking to supply capital and take a piece of the action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has opened the door for the latest lending upstarts, which combine digital innovation and efficiency with true term loans akin to bank loans. Their rates are higher than those charged by banks but lower than those charged by the short-term alternative lenders and the merchant cash advance providers. ''It's not about disintermediating the banks but the very high-yield lenders,'' said Ethan Senturia, chief executive of Dealstruck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Senturia's company can offer lower rates by targeting midprime or near-prime borrowers and by lending larger amounts for longer terms. Dealstruck, like Funding Circle, uses a peer-to-peer model, meaning wealthy investors put up the capital for individual loans, which the lenders say lowers their cost of capital by freeing them from raising money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To secure the loans, these platforms typically require a personal guarantee or business assets as collateral. Along with lower rates, the new lenders offer some transparency to what has been an opaque and confusing market. ''We are trying to price fairly for the business,'' Mr. Senturia said. ''That doesn't always mean cheap. But we will tell you what we are charging and why.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealstruck's interest rates range from 8 to 24 percent for loans of up to $250,000 that can stretch for three years. Funding Circle, a British lender that has expanded into the United States, charges 10 to 17 percent for loans of up to $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The peer-to-peer model is already established in consumer lending, with two companies, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper, making more than $4 billion in consumer loans. Now the market for peer-to-peer small-business loans is heating up. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> plans to expand into the market this year. And Daric, a peer platform backed by a former Wells Fargo chief executive, opened recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fundation, which is based in New York, offers terms friendly to small borrowers on par with the peer-to-peer lenders, but a partner, Garrison Investment Group, supplies the money. ''There's a lot of room for a lot of different types of lenders,'' Mr. Graziano said. Since opening last year, his company has made about 90 loans at rates ranging from 9 to 24 percent. The average loan is $175,000 with a three-year term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those loans went to Lydia Aguinaldo, owner of Pines Home Health Care Services, in Broward County, Fla. Like Mr. Rincon, she had resorted to a high-interest loan from a merchant cash advance provider for her 13-year-old adult care business. She replaced that loan recently with a three-year, $250,000 loan from Fundation. The interest rate, 19 percent, is still high, she said, but it is much lower than what she had been paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fresh competition is already forcing established players to adjust. In February, <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> announced it would begin offering loans of up to $250,000 with terms of 12 to 24 months and interest rates of 20 to 40 percent. Noah Breslow, <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span>'s chief executive, said the move into bigger, longer-term loans reflects the growing accuracy of <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span>'s lending model, now in its fourth generation, and market demand. ''I don't think we'll ever get to a five-year bank loan, but we'll continue to move upstream,'' Mr. Breslow said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competitive scrum can only be good news for small businesses with big plans. Mr. Hecht of Fundera predicted a day when ''there is a credit product out there for everyone.'' He added, ''We're just at the beginning of this.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDLOS ANGELES -- Hardly a week after Cyrus and Ina Chung had moved to Providence, R.I., to start new jobs, this married couple were standing here in a parking lot, dressed in formal clothes with the Southern California sun bearing down on them in late June, having paid a total of $3,000 for the privilege of being extras in the ''Veronica Mars'' movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chung, a lawyer and devoted viewer of the cult television series of the same name, which starred Kristen Bell as a sarcastic teenage detective, still recalled the day that previous March when Ms. Bell and Rob Thomas, the ''Veronica Mars'' creator, announced that they were seeking donations to raise the film's budget on Kickstarter, the online crowdfunding site.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After discovering that many tantalizing rewards promised to top donors had already been claimed, Mr. Chung moved quickly when two nonspeaking background roles became available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this is the most excited I've ever seen him,'' Ms. Chung said on the set. ''Even more than our wedding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, nearly a year after some 91,000 donors contributed about $5.7 million to revive ''Veronica Mars'' after it was canceled in 2007, and months after a whirlwind 24-day film shoot, this much-discussed movie will be released March 14 in theaters and via video on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After one of the first celebrity Kickstarter campaigns, the arrival of the ''Veronica Mars'' movie raises mysteries that even its titular crime solver -- now a law-school graduate who is drawn into a murder case in her hometown -- would find challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would success look like for ''Veronica Mars''? Will it set off a stampede of studios reviving dormant franchises in crowdfunded projects, or was it a one-time phenomenon? Will it even work as a movie, and will anyone other than its most obsessive fans want to see it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is new to me,'' Mr. Thomas said from his trailer earlier that morning, ''and a lot of it is outside my comfort zone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When CW canceled ''Veronica Mars'' after its third season, Mr. Thomas said, he intentionally gave the series an unsatisfying resolution, hoping the network might pause before pulling the plug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They told me at the time, 'Hey, there's a chance you won't be back, if you want to tie things up nicely,' '' recalled Mr. Thomas, a former college football player who has retained his muscular build. ''And my view was, 'No, I don't want to make it easy for you to cancel us.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next five years, Mr. Thomas, whose other shows have included short-lived cult hits like ''Party Down,'' said he could not complete an interview without being asked when the show -- which had never drawn much more than three million viewers an episode -- would be turned into a movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Warner Bros., which owns ''Veronica Mars,'' was willing to consider a direct-to-video sequel, Mr. Thomas said he had no interest in such a project, and the studio's marketing surveys, he said, did not show enough nationwide familiarity with the property to warrant a multimillion-dollar investment for a proper feature film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At that time, I thought we were dead,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed as Mr. Thomas took note of websites like Kickstarter, which held the potential to convert the fervent enthusiasm of a modest audience into needed dollars for a lower-budget movie. To that point, the site was a launching pad for offbeat inventions and grass-roots efforts -- Mr. Thomas had used it to give money to the indie rock band Cotton Mather for an album rerelease -- and a route to Hollywood, rather than a mechanism Hollywood could make use of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2012, when Mr. Thomas and Ms. Bell were preparing to post an online video that would announce this fund-raising drive, Mr. Thomas said, Warner Bros. denied them permission to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was as hopeless as I've ever felt,'' said Mr. Thomas, who considered releasing the video anyway, then thought better of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What he said was as important as the money that could be generated was ''the heat that comes by being the first one out of the gate,'' which would make a ''Veronica Mars'' film ''the 'Blair Witch Project' of crowdfunded movies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It petrified me for a year,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I kept thinking, 'I'm going to wake up tomorrow and someone else is going to be doing this.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Gewecke, the chief digital officer at Warner Bros. Entertainment, said in an interview that this was not a false start on the part of the studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gewecke said Warner Bros. wanted the Kickstarter campaign ''to be as successful as it could possibly be,'' and ''wanted to make sure it was set up to have the maximum chance of success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rob and Kristen had a very well-developed, clearly articulated vision,'' he said. ''Their relationship with the fans was strong, and the fan base was incredibly passionate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Thomas and Ms. Bell's pitch went live last year, with a goal of garnering $2 million in a month, it hit that target in less than 12 hours and went on to nearly triple that in 30 days. (Prizes and incentives offered to donors, like autographed posters and voice mail messages from Ms. Bell, surely helped, as did a tidal wave of news media coverage.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bell, who was speaking from the ''Veronica Mars'' set three months after giving birth to her daughter, Lincoln, said she was deeply concerned that the crowdfunding drive would be a judgment on her clout to carry a film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a moment when I thought, 'Could this be a direct reflection of whether or not I'm wanted as an actress at all?' '' said Ms. Bell, whose résumé includes films like ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall'' and the Showtime series ''House of Lies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, right in your face,'' she said. (Had the ''Veronica Mars'' film not happened, she said, ''I would have just spent the summer with the baby.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Bell said there was something special about the Veronica Mars character, who is sharp-tongued and unconcerned about fitting in with the in-crowd, that longtime fans would want to support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rob wrote Veronica as this queen of the disenfranchised,'' Ms. Bell said. ''All these people who were affected by Veronica, who say, 'This got me through high school,' were able to say: 'I now have a job. I can give you 10 bucks.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the several dozen backers on the ''Veronica Mars'' set in June seemed to agree with Ms. Bell's assessment, though they had paid upward of $2,500 to play additional guests at the character's high-school reunion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These donors, mostly in their 20s and 30s, had watched the series in its original run or discovered it on video, and spoke of their eagerness to see the story continue. They understood that they were not investors in the movie and would not receive any potential profits, and that their contributions only covered part of its budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Warner Bros., which is paying for fulfillment costs like the delivery of ''Veronica Mars'' DVDs and T-shirts, declined to say how much more it had chipped in.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrea Cremer, a Kickstarter backer and author of the ''Nightshade'' young-adult novels, said she had contributed $2,500 because she wanted to see if Veronica would reunite with her sometime boyfriend Logan Echolls (played by Jason Dohring).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a big chunk of money,'' Ms. Cremer said. ''I was planning on going on vacation this summer, and it was like, well, either vacation budget or 'Veronica Mars.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Dengler, a Toronto entrepreneur and a founder of the currency website xe.com, said he gave $10,000 to ''Veronica Mars'' because it had made Kickstarter ''a benchmark, opened it up to a wider audience and made it a household term.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial success of the ''Veronica Mars'' campaign opened the floodgates on the celebrity sales pitches and vanity projects that have become ubiquitous on the site: a movie directed by Zach Braff that received additional funding from an independent studio even though it met its $2 million target; a proposed romantic comedy from Melissa Joan Hart that failed to reach its $2 million goal. But Mr. Dengler said Kickstarter users could tell which proposals were fully thought out and worthy of their donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cases like ''Veronica Mars,'' he said, ''People have said: 'Yes, I would like resolution. I would like to see those characters come back and explore what happened to them later on.' That's accessible, and that's something you can sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Other people have said: 'Hi, I'm someone famous that you know. Give me money to make something,' '' he added. ''And it's like: 'You know what? No.' It doesn't have the same sort of resonance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Warner Bros. was coy about discussing box office expectations for ''Veronica Mars'' (which will play in only about 270 theaters to start), or detailing how much it hoped to make from sales of tickets and digital downloads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gewecke would only say, ''We definitely already view this as a big success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor would the studio say what its further plans were for ''Veronica Mars,'' whether as a continuing franchise of high- or low-budget movies or in some other format, or what other titles in its library it might similarly resuscitate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are always looking at: Are there other properties that make sense?'' Mr. Gewecke said. ''Are there other new ways of thinking about how we bring titles to market?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''We look at every opportunity, case by case. We're really pleased with how this has turned out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas said he believed Warner Bros. was taking the right approach with ''Veronica Mars,'' given the size and scope of the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would scare the hell out of me if they decided, 'Hey, we're going to put $30 million in publicity behind it and release it on 3,000 screens,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we made back our money and then some, that would be thrilling,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I don't expect to compete with the 'Twilight' movies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eyes of Kickstarter donors like Kari Sutherland, a senior editor of children's books at HarperCollins who was 27 weeks pregnant when she visited the ''Veronica Mars'' shoot, there is no way the film can fall short of their fantasies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recalling a conversation she had with her husband, a neuropsychologist, before she came to the set, Ms. Sutherland said he told her, '' 'You know it's going to get made, Kari.' I was like: 'Yes, this is true. And we're going to see it multiple times.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he asked, '' 'We are?' ,'' she answered, '' 'Yes, we are.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: March 16, 2014, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the new movie ''Veronica Mars,'' a sequel to the cult TV show of the same name, gave an incorrect spelling from a publicist for the surname of the man shown in a photo of a fan taking a selfie with Kristen Bell, who stars in the film.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Early last year, Mathijs de Meijer had an idea, one that started as a joke and turned into a company. After a construction mishap knocked out the heating system in the home of his friend, Boaz Leupe, on a cold day, Mr. de Meijer stopped by to visit, a laptop under his arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said '''Hey, why don't we go to Dell.com, buy 100 laptops and then we'll have some nerd heat,''' Mr. Leupe recalled. ''We had a bit of a laugh about that, and then we realized it wasn't a bad idea.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Nerdalize, based in Delft, the Netherlands, is ramping up its plan to replace home radiators with disguised computer servers and sell data processing time to remote users while the excess heat warms the house for free. The company is valued at between 2 million and 3 million euros, or about $2.7 million and $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, Mr. de Meijer, Mr. Leupe and the company's third co-founder, Florian Schneider, have gotten a helping hand from YES!Delft, a small-business incubator that, like others across Europe, offers advice, office space and connections to help environmentally focused tech start-ups get off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incubators, many of them backed by government funding, are seeking both economic and environmental returns. At the same time, they hope to keep Europe competitive in the global sector known as cleantech, an area that includes everything from electric cars and ''smartgrid'' power transmission systems to high-capacity batteries and technologies to harvest energy from new sources like waves and tides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be entrepreneurs ''come in with a nice technology,'' said Frans Nauta, deputy director of entrepreneurship at Climate-KIC, a <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>-funded effort that supports environment-focused tech start-ups through incubators at universities. ''To get them in 18 months to the point where they know their stuff so well that an investor can be comfortable to invest a million, that's my work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 60 and 70 incubators across Europe offer support to cleantech companies, said Stephan van Dijk, innovation program manager at the <span class="companylink">Delft University of Technology</span>, who is researching the role of cleantech incubators for a <span class="companylink">European Union</span> study. Most do so as part of a program aimed at promoting tech start-ups in general, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incubators often rent space to young companies in buildings that house dozens of start-ups, so the entrepreneurs can chat over coffee or meet in the hallways and exchange ideas. Often linked to a university -- Climate-KIC's sites include <span class="companylink">Imperial College in London</span>, the Paris Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Berlin -- they offer access to coaches who help with business issues, scientists with a wide range of technical expertise and networks of contacts, including suppliers, potential customers and private investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At YES!Delft, where about 20 of the 70 start-ups are cleantech-focused, Mr. Leupe, of Nerdalize, said the offices were brimming with energy and creativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You do get engineers running through the building shaking their hands in victory every once in a while,'' Mr. Leupe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Recently, we had the entire executive board of one of the largest energy companies in Europe'' in the office, sipping coffee, Mr. Leupe said. ''It adds a lot of network, it adds a lot of knowledge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cleantech sector, particularly its renewable energy segment, has been through a bumpy few years, particularly in the United States, where enthusiastic investors jumped in in droves in the mid-2000s, then took losses as falling prices and scaled-back government support hurt many companies. Many investors are now more cautious about a sector in which up-front capital requirements can be high, development periods long and technologies risky and complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Progress has been smoother in Europe, where the cleantech frenzy was never as fevered as in California's Silicon Valley, Mr. Nauta said. But because the Continent lacks the rich environment of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists that characterize start-up hotspots like Silicon Valley or New York, many incubators still depend on government funding, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very hard to run a privately run business incubator in Europe and be profitable,'' said Oriol Pascual, a cleantech consultant whose firm, Enviu Barcelona, works with two incubators in the Spanish city. In the United States, he said, ''every time you have a new round, you have 300 candidates, you pick 20'' new companies. In Europe, ''if you get 30 or 40 or 50, you are lucky,'' he said, perhaps because risk-taking is less a part of the business culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cleantech sector is changing, though, as expensive projects like big solar arrays and windfarms have been joined by a new, lower-cost area known as cleanweb, whose companies make use of software or Internet applications to more efficiently manage resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many cleanweb companies focus on energy and water, and on making smart use of the troves of data generated in an increasingly digital world. Those are all important themes at this week's CeBIT information technology trade fair in Hanover, Germany. Unlike the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, which is more consumer oriented, CeBIT focuses on the tech needs of businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Copenhagen, cleantech start-ups benefit from the Danish government's strong commitment to renewable energy. Denmark, whose current strength in the manufacture of wind energy equipment stems from a government decision to back the sector in the 1970s, now plans to wean itself from fossil fuels entirely by 2050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs are responding, and Copenhagen has become an important hub of new cleantech activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Green Entrepreneur House, more than 70 companies seek advice from professors at the Technical University of Denmark and make use of the school's sophisticated testing and demonstration facilities to try out new energy technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A model energy system, complete with wind turbines, battery-charging stations and houses that mimic consumer habits, helps start-ups hone new smartgrid applications, said Kristine Garde, head of cleantech innovation at Scion DTU, the university-linked technology park that runs the green incubator. The effort is backed by more than €2 million in government funds, Ms. Garde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Britain, <span class="companylink">the Carbon Trust</span>, a group focused on fighting climate change, works with about 300 start-ups across Europe in efforts that have been backed by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>, the <span class="companylink">British government</span> and <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The gaps that each venture has, the problems, differ from one venture to the next, they differ according to the stage the company's at or the particular challenge that venture faces,'' said David Aitken, head of the trust's incubation efforts. A big part of an incubator's value is ''the external sounding board, someone saying, 'We think your gaps are here and here, and we'll help you address them.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the companies <span class="companylink">the Carbon Trust</span> has supported is SenseLogix, whose product combines sensors with software to tailor buildings' energy use to occupants' needs, an approach it says can cut consumption by as much as a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With companies around the world pushing forward on cleantech, Europe must be on top of its game to stay competitive, said Mr. Aitken. And in such a technologically complex sector, incubators can play a key role in helping companies get products to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't do it for you,'' said Wouter Robers, whose company Epyon, which makes fast-charging batteries for electric vehicles, was bought by the Swiss power technology firm ABB in 2011. But the help he got from YES!Delft ''was pretty instrumental,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest testimony to the role played by the incubator?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Robers has a new start-up venture, using three-dimensional printing to make prototypes for companies designing new products, and he is back at YES!Delft again.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Marvin Gay, 71, a retired accountant, and his wife, Leslie, 61, decided to open a Painting With a Twist franchise in St. Petersburg, Fla., their start-up costs were close to $70,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To finance the business, which combines art instruction with bring-your-own wine (or soft drink) parties, the couple tapped their personal savings.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interest rate at the time, 2009, was about zero, so we weren't making any money on our savings,'' he reasoned. ''We saw it as an opportunity to take a portion and use it for something we could control -- we were investing in ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year and a half later, the couple spent roughly $60,000 to open a second studio in Tampa. ''Now we're ready for a third,'' Mr. Gay said. ''Call me nuts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, not that crazy. Last year, according to Mr. Gay (who has been kidded for decades because his name sounds like that of the late soul singer Marvin Gaye), the two operations pulled in $750,000, up 32 percent over 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after some growing pains, both studios are in the black, each drawing about 350 paying customers weekly and allowing the Gays to draw salaries for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are part of a growing cohort of retirees starting businesses. According to a study published by the <span class="companylink">Kauffman Foundation</span> and <span class="companylink">LegalZoom</span>, about 20 percent of all new businesses in 2013 were created by entrepreneurs ages 50 to 59, and 15 percent were 60 and over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But financing a retiree start-up can be tricky. The most common method is using personal savings, as the Gays did, said Edward Rogoff, the Lawrence N. Field Professor of Entrepreneurship in the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College in New York. That can be risky and costly, given the rules governing withdrawals from retirement accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But retirees can also hunt down local economic development loans or even use crowdfunding sites to raise capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Generally, as a person gets old, their tolerance for risk decreases, or it should decrease,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''Somebody who is 26 and starting a business can bet the ranch because if it fails, at 31, they can start another business. But somebody who is 61 or 68 who starts a business can't bet the ranch because at 75 or older, they won't be able to get the ranch back and start over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a variety of sensible approaches, Mr. Rogoff said. A retiree might find a partner to chip in, or start small, with a website, for example, rather than a brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Senate hearing in February, titled ''In Search of a Second Act: The Challenges and Advantages of Senior Entrepreneurship,'' explored issues like illegal age bias by lending organizations and the need to develop tax incentives for senior start-ups. One idea discussed was expanding initiatives like the State Employee Assistance Program to allow long-term unemployed older adults to use their unemployment benefits to start a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the nation continues to struggle with unemployment near 7 percent, it makes sense to consider reforms to the unemployment insurance program that would help people get back to work,'' said Senator Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine, of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. ''This could be through assistance to help people start their own businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to dipping into personal savings accounts, another common option for older entrepreneurs is calling on the generosity of friends and family. When Bill Skees, then 56, needed capital to finance his independent bookstore Well Read New &amp; Used Books in Hawthorne, N.J., he asked his six siblings for loans, pledging 3.5 percent interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was about four years ago, and with the sluggish economic recovery, he's had to slow down his payback plan. ''My family is my biggest cheerleader and has been great about it,'' he said. ''That's because I do have a plan, and I kept the lines of communications open.'' Mr. Skees expects that the money will be fully repaid by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many who want to start a business, the local bank is frequently a first stop for financing. But ''most banks aren't that keen on loans for a senior business start-up, because they are not big enough,'' said Elizabeth Isele, a founder of SeniorEntrepreneurshipWorks.org, a nonprofit venture geared toward helping workers over age 50 start their own businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those that do clear the gatekeepers, a solid business plan and a clean credit record are prerequisites. And a lender probably will want the borrower to be prepared to personally invest in the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks don't like to lend money for ideas,'' Professor Rogoff said. ''They lend money against cash flow for existing businesses and against assets they can collect against in the future.'' One resource for learning more is BusinessUSA, the federal government's site for entrepreneurs seeking small-business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who have built up some equity in their homes, a home equity loan is a fairly easy route to gain access to cash, and interest is generally manageable. Even faster is using personal credit cards. ''But however tempting that is, it's very expensive, and it's not tax-deductible,'' Mr. Rogoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to seek out so-called angel investors who will back you in exchange for equity or partial ownership. The <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>'s <span class="companylink">Small Business Investment Company</span> program can offer leads. In general, the best way to find an angel investor is for budding business owners to contact the network they developed during their careers, Mr. Rogoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A relative newcomer in start-up financing is crowdfunding. These virtual fund-raising campaigns generally raise small sums, and donors are not repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Kickstarter, entrepreneurs post videos describing a project with a target dollar amount and deadline, then start an email campaign to get the word out. When someone donates, payments are made by credit card through Amazon. When the goal is reached, Kickstarter takes 5 percent, and the business owner pays 3 to 5 percent to Amazon's credit card service. If the business owner doesn't raise the money by the deadline, the pledges are canceled. Another site that entrepreneurs can use is Indiegogo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdlending is a variation on the theme, but in this case, people expect to get their money back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, for example, Chancey M. Lindsey-Peake, 62, a retired housekeeper and nanny, started her banana bread bakery, Banana Manna, in Greenville, S.C. Her backing: a $5,000 zero percent interest loan funded through Kiva Zip, a type of crowdfunding. She fully repaid it in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This type of microloan is patched together by the nonprofit Kiva with loans as small as $5. The pilot program started in late 2011. So far, the nonprofit said, loans have been made in 42 states. Last year, 400 loans were exchanged through the program, up from 100 in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The plan is for the lender to get the amount they loaned back, but there's no financial rate of return,'' said Jonny Price, senior director of the Kiva Zip Program. ''It's an emotional rate of return. They get that feel-good factor they are supporting their friend, this entrepreneur in their community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another player in the field is Accion, which offers loans averaging $7,000 with fixed annual interest rates from 11 to 16 percent, plus closing and application costs. The S.B.A. also issues microloans up to $50,000. In general, the rates range from 8 to 13 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But waiting for loans from others can be frustrating. Many retirees simply use their retirement funds and accept the risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new twist is ''rollovers as business start-ups,'' or ROBS, which raise the risks a bit higher, according to some experts. With this approach, business owners use their retirement funds, like 401(k) assets, to finance or expand a business without incurring taxes or penalties. The account is rolled over into a new retirement fund. And that new retirement fund, in effect, becomes a shareholder in the start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's legitimate, according to the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>, but it's complicated. And if it is not set up perfectly, it could result in penalties and a big tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Gay, the Painting With a Twist franchisee, the laughter of customers swirling brushes and sipping wine while painting a portrait is a priceless reward of his retirement venture. But having the ability to self-finance is what gives him peace of mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The start-up costs for our third location will probably be $75,000 to $100,000, and we will be funding that ourselves once again,'' Mr. Gay said. ''We decided five years ago to invest some of our savings in a business where we could have some control and that hasn't failed us yet.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, China's leaders announced their intention to enact sweeping reforms in economic and social policies. This week, they said they were ready to carry out some important financial changes that could strengthen the country's banking system and benefit savers and small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese banking regulators said on Tuesday that the country would remove government limits on the interest rates banks pay on deposits sometime in the next two years. They also said that private businesses would be allowed to open five banks in two major cities and two provinces. Depending on how these changes are carried out (many details are not public), they could significantly shake up the financial system, which is dominated by state-owned banks that primarily lend to inefficient government enterprises and a fast-growing shadow banking system that operates with little regulatory oversight.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on customer deposits are currently set at 0.35 percent. Those artificially low rates have benefited banks by keeping their costs of doing business low. But they have also encouraged Chinese families to put their money into more risky investments like real estate, stocks and lightly regulated wealth management products, which invest in projects that cannot get loans from banks. Letting those rates rise and creating a deposit insurance system, which Chinese officials have said they intend to do, should make it easier for ordinary people to save money without taking outsize risks. Higher rates should also make it harder for politically connected businesses and government-owned enterprises to get loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allowing the establishment of the first privately operated banks in the country in Shanghai and Tianjin and in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang could help increase lending to privately run small and medium-size businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These steps are only a start. Since 2008, the total debt in the Chinese economy has surged to about 210 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- a very high level for a developing country. What's most troubling is that a lot of the growth has taken place in the shadow banking system, which is made up of lightly regulated trust companies and unregulated money lenders. A few businesses that took high-interest loans from shadow banks have recently defaulted on their debts and analysts fear many more will default as the economy slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese officials have to strike a careful balance. If they hit the brakes too hard to curb lending by state-owned banks and shadow lenders, they could precipitate a crisis. But if they are slow to act, the financial system will become even more vulnerable.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you work at a home-based business, you may want to consider a new, simpler option for taking a deduction for your home office on your federal income tax return this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> announced last year a streamlined option for the home office deduction, effective for the 2014 filing season. The agency said the new ''common sense'' alternative aims to reduce paperwork and record-keeping hassles for those who claim the home office deduction.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately 3.3 million taxpayers claimed nearly $10 billion with the deduction in the tax year 2011, the I.R.S. said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new ''simplified'' option involves multiplying the square footage of your home office -- up to 300 square feet -- by a fixed amount of $5 to determine your deduction, which is capped at $1,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To claim the optional deduction, you can complete a short work sheet found in the tax instructions and enter the result on your tax return. (If you're self-employed, you claim it on Schedule C, Line 30; if you're employed for someone else, but use a home office, you claim it on Schedule A, Line 21.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, the only way to claim the deduction required filling out Form 8829, a 43-line document. That option -- which the I.R.S. calls the ''regular,'' or standard method -- can involve complex calculations of allocated expenses and depreciation, and carry-overs of unused deductions. That approach, the agency said, can be ''burdensome'' for small-business owners, because they have to keep all sorts of records, like mortgage and utility statements, to calculate their deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you use the new option, you can't depreciate the portion of your home used for business. But you can claim allowable mortgage interest, real estate taxes and insurance losses on your home as itemized deductions on Schedule A. These deductions don't have to be allocated between personal and business use, as the regular method requires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with taxes in general, however, things can be tricky even if they appear simple at first. The new method may be a particularly good option if you're less than diligent about keeping expense records for use of your home office, said Jessi Dolmage, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">TaxACT</span>, a provider of online tax preparation software. If you do keep detailed expense records, though, you might be better off using the standard method. To be sure, you have to calculate the deduction using both methods. So much for fewer hassles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the regular approach may yield a larger deduction, said Ms. Dolmage, particularly if your office is small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a quick idea of whether the simplified option makes sense, you can multiply your home office's square footage by $5, and compare the result with your deduction on last year's tax return. If the result is more or about the same, you can go with the simpler form. But if it's less, you may want to take the time to calculate your actual expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If historically you've taken a larger deduction, you might be better off with the old-fashioned method,'' said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for CCH, a tax information provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some additional questions about the home office deduction:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Does the simplified option make it easier for my work space to qualify as a home office for tax purposes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. The simplified option doesn't change the criteria for a home office; it just reduces the calculations and record-keeping requirements associated with taking a deduction for its expenses. To qualify, you still must use the space regularly and ''exclusively'' as your principal place of business, according to Mr. Luscombe of CCH. (That means your home office can't double as, say, your child's playroom.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you work as an employee of a business, rather than being self-employed, your home office must be for the convenience of your employer in order to qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; If I moved last year and used home offices in different houses, can I use the simplified option?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes -- but for just one of the homes. The deduction for the other home must be calculated using actual expenses, according to the I.R.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Where can I find more details about using the simplified option?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See I.R.S. Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, available online. Or or visit the I.R.S. website for some frequently asked questions about the new option.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ESTABLISHED museums like the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian Institution</span> are increasingly turning to crowdfunding appeals to help pay for exhibits and programs that tight budgets might otherwise preclude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual artists have been soliciting donations from the public for years, using Internet fund-raising platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Razoo to defray the costs of producing their work. Museums, long reliant on corporate sponsorships, gifts and bequests, have been more hesitant to raise funds digitally because the substantial commitment of staff time required for such campaigns does not always produce a big financial win.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the successes of some of the museum world's biggest institutions is spurring interest by museum fund-raisers. <span class="companylink">The Louvre</span>, for example, used crowdfunding -- the solicitation of money from individuals online -- to raise more than $1 million two years ago to purchase two 13th-century ivory figurines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big-name museums have had smaller successes. The Phillips Collection in Washington surpassed its $15,000 goal last year on Indiegogo to finance a room sculpted from beeswax by the German artist Wolfgang Laib, and the Arthur A. Sackler Gallery, part of the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span>, raised $176,000 to defray some costs of an exhibit on art connected with yoga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> effort was the biggest campaign undertaken by an American museum,'' said Laura Kakolewski, marketing manager for <span class="companylink">Americans for the Arts</span>, an organization that promotes museums. ''Museums are taking a cue from artists and tapping into a new potential source of donors, and creating a sense of belonging among their patrons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such campaigns require resources and staff time to design the visual and other elements including the website, oversee the email and social media contacts, and follow up with efforts to convert new givers to loyal, longtime donors. And if a campaign misfires and does not attract public money, the failure is visibly embarrassing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> had some bad luck with online fund-raising. When its Hirshhorn Museum sought to raise $35,000 on Causes.com to bring a sculpture by the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei to Washington in 2012, the effort raised only $555, the website showed. The same year, the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian's American Art Museum</span> raised only a few thousand dollars for an exhibit to be called ''Art of Video Games.'' Participants could donate $10 online to play a video game on the museum's website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the yoga exhibit, the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> took another chance on digital fund-raising because it was a ''perfect meeting point of a popular practice that people are invested in, and the limited resources we had to carry out the exhibit,'' said Yoonhyung Lee, the institution's director of digital media philanthropy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since yoga has millions of devoted practitioners, she said, the museum felt it would more easily attract backers. The money raised was spent on shipping art from England and India, publishing a color catalog and hosting free public programs. While the exhibit had been planned far in advance to borrow 130 sculptures and other objects from 25 museums around the world, the Sackler did not have the funds for the additional events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other appeals that have attracted substantial support include the effort by the Architecture and Design Museum in Los Angeles, which last month surpassed its $40,000 goal, from 436 backers, on Kickstarter for the ''Never Built'' exhibition, which will show how differently the city would look if certain projects had been constructed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter, which has 135 appeals tagged as museum projects on its website, also hosted an effort to create the Marina Abramovic Institute, which is devoted to performance art. The appeal raised $661,452 in August, attracting nearly 5,000 supporters to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there have been notable failures, too. The Philip J. Curie Dinosaur Museum, in Grand Prairie, Alberta, tried to raise $1 million on Indiegogo to help construct a new museum, but raised only $34,000. The project went ahead anyway with more traditional sources of financing and government grants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kickstarter campaign last year to raise $9,900 to clean and preserve Thomas Allen's painting ''Evening Market'' by the <span class="companylink">Hunter Museum of American Art</span> in Chattanooga, Tenn., collected only $3,371. On Kickstarter, failure to reach the goal means the project gets no money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help museums mount successful campaigns, the <span class="companylink">American Alliance of Museums</span> offers a web seminar and the fund-raising platforms, which make money by taking a percentage of the funds raised, offer online videos, guidance and some coaching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another impetus to try such alternative fund-raising is research that shows online giving is rising, with donations to arts and culture increasing 8.5 percent last year, said Steve MacLaughlin, of Blackbaud, a software provider for nonprofits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The total percentage of arts and culture giving that comes from online sources is 6.8 percent -- a percentage which is greater than the 6.4 percent for overall online giving sources,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee, of the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span>, said: ''Everyone wants to do it, but the amount of work involved is enormous, whether it's to raise $10,000 or $100,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allison Peck, the head of marketing and public affairs for the Sackler and the <span class="companylink">Freer Gallery of Art</span>, also part of the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span>, who worked on the ''Together We Are One'' yoga exhibit effort, said, ''It takes a lot of time, and you have to create a buzz around it.'' The exhibit, which is traveling to other cities, is now at San Francisco's Asian Art Museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Peck and her colleagues started their effort six weeks before the May 2013 start of the campaign, deciding on its goals, hiring a contractor to create a campaign video and creating a website, printable posters and an array of social media tools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To spark interest, they enlisted yoga messengers, a group of yoga teachers and practitioners, through local contacts. About 250 such messengers either distributed materials or held yoga classes to acquaint people with the fund-raising effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> also constructed a detailed chart with a daily message schedule on the Internet and a weekly theme, such as yoga and health, with information presented on a one-minute video, blog and email message. Communications with potential givers were coordinated with planned giving by sponsors to ask for matching gifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lesley Mansford, chief executive of Razoo, which hosted the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> campaign, said each fund-raising effort needed to be small and targeted, and supported by donors and social media influencers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just putting a page up on the Internet and hoping people will come,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> campaigners also followed up with thank-you emails and tax receipts, and, as a reward, inscribed the names of donors on a digital plaque they created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big chunk of the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span>'s fund-raising take came from its corporate sponsor Whole Foods, which gave $70,000. An anonymous corporate giver provided $30,000, leaving the donations from the public at around $76,000, the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that is still substantial, Ms. Lee said the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> would be cautious about future initiatives. Digital giving, she predicted, was ''unlikely to replace traditional giving. It's like trying to fill a bucket with one grain of sand.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN the idea for the Museum of Science Fiction struck Greg Viggiano last April, he shot into warp speed. He wrote a business plan, picked Washington as a prospective location, recruited volunteers and produced a video featuring befuddled Imperial storm troopers, armed with maps, searching for the phantom museum near the United States Capitol. Mr. Viggiano used the video as part of a crowdfunding campaign that has raised almost $48,000, an amount he described as a ''rounding error in terms of how much we're going to need.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Viggiano, an entrepreneur and a consultant, has developed new products and advised several federal agencies but has no experience running a museum. Ultimately, he hopes to raise roughly $30 million for his museum's future home: an approximately 50,000-square-foot building with interactive galleries devoted to aliens, artificial intelligence and time travel. But first, he has more terrestrial ambitions. The museum plans to open online initially, then rent a ''preview museum,'' in a space with roughly 3,000 square feet in Washington, to test its appeal. The question, as Mr. Viggiano puts it, is ''Will it play in Peoria?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or Washington?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a billionaire benefactor to underwrite a project, it is a challenging time for aspiring curators to get into the museum business, say consultants who advise cultural institutions. A survey last year by the <span class="companylink">American Alliance of Museums</span> found that more than two-thirds of museums faced ''economic stress'' in 2012. And 35 percent of the survey's respondents reported reduced government support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Getting people behind what I think of as a serious museum is very difficult right now,'' said Mark Walhimer, managing partner of Museum Planning in San Francisco. For start-ups to flourish, museum founders must think big but start small. ''You are building a culture -- not a building,'' Mr. Walhimer added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixating on bricks and mortar at the expense of compelling programming and a potent marketing plan is the most common mistake new museums make, said James R. Hackney Jr., managing partner of Alexander Haas, a fund-raising consulting firm in Atlanta. ''It's so sexy and exciting to look at putting up a structure that sometimes people forget: 'Oops! We have got to run it once it gets open,' '' Mr. Hackney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimistic museum founders frequently ''lowball'' operating expenses during the planning process, Adrian Ellis, director of AEA Consulting in Beacon, N.Y., said in an email. Mr. Ellis cited the defunct National Center for Popular Music in Sheffield, England, as an example of poor planning. Britain's lottery, which makes grants with its profits, awarded the pop museum 11 million pounds ($18.3 million), most of the project's cost. The museum then spent much of the funds on its flashy buildings, a quartet of massive stainless steel drums with rotating tops that the BBC suggested looked ''more like an oil refinery than a museum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After opening in 1999, the Sheffield museum drew about a quarter of the visitors it projected and shut down after 15 months. According to a post-mortem published in the journal Museum and Society, the pop museum was criticized for underwhelming exhibits and assuming that it could lure visitors from all over the country to industrial Sheffield -- a city with high unemployment that is not known as a tourism hot spot. ''Besides the venue itself,'' wrote the article's co-authors, ''there were few other attractions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underfunded museums might never get off the ground, but ''too much money,'' observes Mr. Ellis, ''stops people thinking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Strickland, who was creative director at the pop museum, acknowledges that ''the basic concept of trying to capture pop music in a static museum is flawed. This was in an era of an emerging Internet in the U.K., but now websites do it far better.'' The museum's team of consultants, in Mr. Strickland's analysis, dispensed abysmal advice, including allowing Sheffield to be the museum's location. ''It's a great place but doesn't have the historic tradition of York or Edinburgh or a critical mass of attractions such as London,'' concedes Mr. Strickland, who with gallows humor recounted that former colleagues joked ''that there was at least one advising consultant for every £1 million of grant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ellis refers to museums whose buildings make better impressions than their balance sheets as ''living-dead institutions, zombies whose preoccupation is daily survival.'' The Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Va., for instance, has been plagued by financial problems since it built an 81,000-square-foot postmodernist building that drew mixed reviews from architecture critics. Battered by disappointing attendance and operating losses, the museum fired many staff members after its opening in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Capital campaign moneys are very often devoured by direct building costs,'' Bryan Hantman, the museum's marketing manager, said in an email. ''The new Taubman Museum of Art building was no different as a $46 million project grew to $66 million. With such an increase, no money could be set aside for operational endowment.'' The Roanoke museum's finances have improved. According to Mr. Hantman, the museum reported a $1.58 million profit in 2013, but the museum's endowment of roughly $3 million remains modest for a museum of its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like theater producers who tinker with a new play on the road before raising the curtain on Broadway, the four founders of the National Museum of Mathematics staged a traveling exhibition before opening in New York in 2012. The nationwide tour enabled the founders to refine exhibits and brainstorm with experienced executives at science centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I found it shocking how collaborative the museum industry is,'' said Cindy Lawrence, the math museum's co-executive director. She now often consults with start-ups like the Museum of Food and Drink, which plans to open in New York, to ''pay it forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peer review, a vital part of gaining coveted accreditation from the <span class="companylink">American Alliance of Museums</span>, also benefits budding museums and ''sets up a professional atmosphere,'' Mr. Walhimer said. Dewey Blanton, a spokesman for the museum alliance, likens the organization's endorsement to a ''Good Housekeeping seal'' for donors. Many foundations, he notes, reject applicants that lack accreditation. But the quest for it, which typically takes at least two years, demands many staff hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some nascent museums hire consultants to ease the accreditation process, conduct feasibility studies or run capital campaigns, but the founders of the math museum received mostly free advice. ''We didn't do a feasibility study; this is a completely unfeasible project,'' deadpanned Glen Whitney, the math museum's co-executive director and a former hedge fund analyst. The museum's founders did hire a consultant to answer a few questions. ''We had no idea what attendance figures would be,'' Ms. Lawrence said. ''What can you charge for a birthday party?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Lawrence urges would-be museum directors to ignore outside advisers sometimes. A consultant suggested that the National Museum of Mathematics delete ''museum'' from its name, because it translates as ''stuffy.'' Ms. Lawrence and her partners disagreed. ''We want to show people math is cool,'' she said. ''In the end, we said, 'Darn it, we are the museum of math.' '' They apparently made the right choice: The museum attracted 173,225 visitors in its first year -- exceeding estimates, Mr. Whitney calculated, by 155 percent. ''We were not prepared for the onslaught,'' he said, which resulted in staffing shortages that the museum has alleviated but is still working to resolve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising seed money for a museum is arguably easier than ever because of a growing number of crowdfunding websites. Kickstarter, for example, lists many new institutions seeking patrons. But for Mr. Whitney, personally persuading the math museum's first trustee to make a sizable donation was a challenge. At one point during what's known in philanthropy parlance as ''the ask,'' Mr. Whitney handed the donor a math puzzle. ''You are nowhere until you give someone a puzzle,'' Mr. Whitney said. ''Then you've got them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long after Malcolm E. O'Hagan started the American Writers Museum, he won a prestigious director's discretionary grant of $30,000 from the <span class="companylink">National Endowment for the Humanities</span> (as well as a second grant from the agency in 2013). The early credibility bestowed by the first N.E.H. grant apparently improved the writers museum's standing with other funders; Mr. O'Hagan has raised about $1 million so far. His museum is expected to open in Chicago in phases starting in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are trying to raise a million dollars, $10 million or $100 million,'' Mr. Hackney said, ''the top 10 gifts will make or break anything you are doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the N.E.H. grants, Mr. O'Hagan expects little government funding, ''but we wanted government support.'' He chose to open in Chicago in part because he received a warm welcome from local politicians; former Mayor Richard M. Daley and his successor, Rahm Emanuel, both met with Mr. O'Hagan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before settling on a location for a new cultural institution, Mr. Walhimer, the museum consultant in San Francisco, counsels founders to write a one-page proposal and ask local government officials to organize a town-hall meeting to discuss it. ''If politicians are not interested, find another home,'' Mr. Walhimer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most critical decisions museum founders must make is also one of the toughest: knowing when to quit. Successful entrepreneurs, Mr. Hackney says, frequently fail as museum directors. He points out that the ability to make a snap decision, a critical skill in the executive suite, can be of little use in a trustees meeting. ''If you are, for instance, deciding where your museum is going to be located or who the architect is and you are expecting other people to help donate in order to build it, then it's better to involve those people in that decision,'' Mr. Hackney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Ray, who goes by Walkie, a real estate developer and a former chairman of the Discovery Science Center in Santa Ana, Calif., agrees. ''The people who start these institutions, who get the capital together and build the facility,'' Mr. Ray said, ''are not necessarily the people who are best capable of managing it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATHENS -- For Natalie Kontou, 32, Greece's economic crisis may be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing her job at a magazine in 2011, at the peak of the crisis, and a fruitless spell seeking work in Australia the following year, she is now running her own fledgling company. It offers tailor-made tour packages for a growing influx of foreign visitors to Greece.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always wanted to work in tourism, but I never imagined I'd set up my own business, let alone with my friends,'' she said, referring to her three partners at the company, Athens Insiders. After its start last spring, on a budget of only 5,000 euros, or roughly $6,900, the business has broken even after selling 20 tailor-made tours to individuals, couples or groups, and is now seeking financing to expand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurial dream is one that many in Greece are chasing. With scant opportunities in a demolished private sector, with unemployment at a record 28 percent -- and above 60 percent for those under 24 -- many Greeks have stopped waiting for those in power to put the country back on its feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government and Greece's troika of international lenders agreed last week on economic reforms designed to unlock an estimated €10 billion in rescue funds. But virtually all of it is to go toward paying down debt instead of investing in the growth the country desperately needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder some Greeks are taking matters into their own hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although thousands of enterprises have buckled under the pressure of a deepening recession now in its sixth year, thousands of others have opened, in defiance of that bleak narrative. According to government figures, more than 41,000 new companies were formed in Greece last year. Most of those were food or clothing retailers or other types of businesses that few experts would consider entrepreneurial innovators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Endeavor Greece, a nonprofit organization that supports entrepreneurship, counted 144 of those companies as entrepreneurial start-ups -- a ninefold increase from the number founded in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business incubators and shared work spaces have sprung up across Athens and other Greek cities in recent months to accommodate start-ups, while conferences and forums on entrepreneurship and innovation abound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a dozen incubators are competing to foster the best business ideas, helping defray operating costs and offering mentorship. One, called Enter Grow Go, has taken Athens Insiders under its wing along with 20 other start-ups and is backed by Eurobank, the third-largest Greek lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another, Orange Grove, an initiative of the Dutch Embassy in Athens, supports nearly three-dozen new businesses including Clio Muse. Run by three Greeks in their 20s, Clio Muse last month rolled out a mobile application that gives visitors to museums and galleries background articles about selected exhibits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Athens, the newest private incubator is Romantso, named after the defunct women's magazine in whose former headquarters it is based. There, dozens of designers, photographers and web artists pay around €300 a month to rent office space in an environment with an edgy aesthetic where they exchange ideas and expand their start-ups. Romantso supplements its income from the rent with proceeds from an on-site bar, sponsorships and paid seminars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vassilis Haralambidis, a 37-year-old graphic designer who opened Romantso on a tiny street in a run-down central district last autumn, said his aim was to ''stop the misery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We saw that people were numb, that the country was going in the wrong direction and we decided to do something,'' Mr. Haralambidis said. He had postponed paying taxes, he said, in order to plow that money into Romantso, although he declined to discuss the specifics of this deferment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities are lending their support to the start-up movement, as they have in other European countries, like France and Spain, where youth unemployment is also high. The Greek government has reduced the bureaucracy and paperwork that has discouraged entrepreneurs in the past. New legislation, to come into force later this year, would allow a business to be officially set up in a single day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A program subsidized by the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> to support small and medium-size businesses, worth €1 billion is to be divided among more than 16,000 Greek beneficiaries this year. An additional €130 million in <span class="companylink">European Union</span>-backed loans and venture capital programs has already been dispensed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many industry experts see venture capital and loans as a better option than <span class="companylink">European Union</span> grants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Free money is not a solution,'' said Panos Zamanis, co-founder of the Hellenic Startup Association, who advises new businesses, mainly at Orange Grove. He cited reports that millions of euros in European subsidies were squandered in the past on holiday homes and other luxuries. ''There needs to be the obligation to give the money back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some aspiring entrepreneurs said they preferred to approach investors offering seed funding or venture capital firms that can offer expertise along with equity investments, rather than competing for <span class="companylink">European Union</span> money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The subsidies go to people with connections anyway,'' said Yiannis Papageorgiou, 24, who last year set up Truckbird, an online logistics service linking shippers and carriers, with five friends. To attract customers, Truckbird began offering a free-trial service last month. Mr. Papageorgiou said there were now more than 20 companies in the trial, and he was in talks with potential investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture is a bold foray into the trucking industry, one of dozens of so-called closed professions that have been protected from competition by a mass of regulations that the country's international lenders have insisted must be reduced or eliminated to revitalize the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Greece is to emerge from recession, analysts say it must stop being an insular economy where most people work for the state, or in copycat retailing jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Among the crowd of Greeks setting up snack bars and take-aways, a handful are trying to do something better,'' said George Pagoulatos, a professor of European economics and politics at Athens University and a former government adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several fledgling companies have clearly succeeded, some with the initial help of Greek venture capital funds, which have invested €20 million in about 20 domestic start-ups over the past two years, according to Yiannis Papadopoulos who heads the Hellenic Venture Capital Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several notables have expanded internationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxibeat -- a mobile application allowing travelers to choose among nearby taxis on the basis of preferences and ratings by previous passengers -- has been rolled out in France, Mexico, Brazil and Peru since its creation in Athens in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After securing €3.5 million in Greek venture capital, it secured an additional €3 million last year from <span class="companylink">Hummingbird Ventures</span>, a firm in London. Taxibeat says it is now profitable in Greece and has a total of nearly a million users in its various markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bugsense, a Greek company that tracks software flaws in mobile phone applications, was acquired last year by Splunk, a Nasdaq-listed software company based in San Francisco. Cookisto, an online service whose subscribers buy meals from home cooks, has expanded beyond Greece to Britain after securing €200,000 in seed funding from a Greek entrepreneur, Leon Yohai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workable, which designed a software application to aid the hiring process by small businesses that cannot afford a human resources department, has opened offices in London and Portland, Ore., since starting in Athens in 2012. It recently received $1.5 million in financing from Greylock IL, the British-Israel arm of the American venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Greylock Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such trailblazers are inspiration to their fledgling compatriots, like Athens Insiders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know it's a gamble but we're going to stick at it,'' said Ms. Kontou, whose company is planning tours in five different languages and exploring its finance options. ''If we young Greeks don't try and create something new, who will?''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to new securities rules, Hollywood is about to get into the crowdfunding game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A start-up, Junction Investments, plans to open for business on Wednesday, allowing wealthy individuals to invest in movies alongside veteran film financiers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start, the company will offer an online chance to back ''A Hologram for the King,'' an adaptation of the Dave Eggers novel that will star Tom Hanks. Soon after, would-be mini-moguls will be able to invest in ''Triple Nine,'' a thriller featuring Kate Winslet, the ''12 Years a Slave'' star Chiwetel Ejiofor and Woody Harrelson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up has already drawn a number of prominent backers and investors, including the casino billionaire Steve Wynn and the Internet entrepreneur Dave Morin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junction represents the latest change brought about by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, whose passage in 2012 opened up new ways for companies to raise money. The law has already made it easier for companies to go public by eliminating a number of disclosure requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps its most notable change was that it blessed crowdfunding. Groups of so-called accredited investors -- people who either make $200,000 a year or have a net worth of more than $1 million, excluding their home -- can band together to buy up to $1 million of a company's equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With financing hard to raise, crowdfunding has become a buzzword in the movie business. Filmmakers have used sites like Kickstarter to raise money to start production, giving birth to movies like ''Veronica Mars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Junction is taking a different tack, its founders say: The films it will back are already fully funded, and will be made regardless of how much the start-up raises. Any money raised through the site could be used either as an additional cushion or as a replacement for some of the Hollywood financiers' original investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in Hollywood worry that crowdfunding will open start-ups to lawsuits by unhappy investors. But Junction hopes to blunt that concern by giving investors the same terms as the seasoned financiers already involved in a movie. Kickstarter users, by contrast, are essentially donating to projects in return for rewards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors aren't being asked to put money into projects that more experienced financiers have already passed on,'' Brian Goldsmith, a Junction co-founder and a former producer for ''CBS Evening News,'' said in a telephone interview. ''Experienced investors already have skin in the game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective investors visiting the company's website can read about coming projects -- and wade through lengthy legal disclaimers -- before deciding whether to invest. As to whether Junction investors will see their names in the movie credits, that will be up to each film's backers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junction took shape in the fall of 2012 when Mr. Goldsmith began brainstorming with Adam Kaufman, a friend and a former banker at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, about new business opportunities. They hit on the idea of crowdfunding, then decided the entertainment industry would be a perfect start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, the two went to the American Film Market, the conference in Santa Monica, Calif., where filmmakers make their pitches to prospective backers. In a crowded bar overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the two met with Christopher Woodrow and Molly Conners, the heads of the independent film studio Worldview Entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While most people were talking about foreign film rights, we were talking about the JOBS Act,'' said Mr. Kaufman, Junction's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Worldview executives quickly understood the business proposition, and by the end of the half-hour meeting, the two sides shook hands over a partnership, with ''Triple Nine'' serving as the studio's first test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Worldview and Silver Reel Entertainment, which is backing the Tom Hanks movie, other partners include Endgame Entertainment, PalmStar and QED International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Goldsmith soon hired a staff, including a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> engineer, a onetime technology employee at Goldman and a former lawyer at <span class="companylink">Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore</span>. They also began to seek out advisers like Mr. Wynn and Logan Green, the chief executive of the car service Lyft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They got it,'' said Mr. Goldsmith, now Junction's president. ''We didn't have to explain much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though Junction has not yet funded its first movie, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Goldsmith are already thinking of how to expand their business model beyond Hollywood. While the two will not discuss future plans, they said that the crowdfunding model could work elsewhere in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Within the film industry, we're looking at a market of several billion dollars a year,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''Outside of that, it's a market of tens of billions of dollars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- For many of <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span>'s early backers, news that the virtual reality start-up was selling to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for $2 billion was a little like watching Bob Dylan star in a Super Bowl Chrysler commercial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Southern California company got its start on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site where enthusiastic virtual gamers helped it raise $2.4 million in exchange for a free developer's kit or a T-shirt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some of those donors are crying ''sellout.'' They want their money back -- and are happy to return the T-shirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I supported this because it's something that I've wanted to see become a reality since I read my first William Gibson novel,'' one Oculus donor wrote on Kickstarter. ''Now I find out that I might as well have handed my money right to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and I feel a little sick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extraordinary reaction of early <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> backers and fans to news of the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> deal illustrates the tricky relationship between companies raising money on Kickstarter and the people who donate to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope, among donors, is that they can help the interesting ideas of these companies get off the ground. Their donations amount to seed funding -- enough money to build a prototype, perhaps. And assuming they understand what they're doing, the donors have no expectations of gaining equity in the young company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that largess comes a sense of community and expectations that it will deliver -- or at least try really hard -- on what it has promised. But when the little company hits a big payday, as <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> announced on Tuesday, it is strikingly clear that community has very little say in its decision-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $2.4 million raised, <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> was among the 20 most-funded projects on Kickstarter. And for many who pledged $300 -- enough to earn a developer's kit -- it offered hope that virtual reality, a longtime goal of the gaming industry, could finally become viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oculus is only one of many independent Kickstarter projects, which can range from companies to books to a movie, to get picked up by a mainstream organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The gaming developer community is very independently spirited,'' said Tripp Jones, a partner at the venture capital firm <span class="companylink">August Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oculus was their white knight, and the developer community completely bought into the company's vision because they believed Oculus was their best hope for a new independent platform.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''Now that platform is <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s platform.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the unhappiness of donors, Palmer Luckey, the company's co-founder, as recently as last month said he had no intention of selling the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think there's a reasonable number that would make me say, 'You know I was going to change the world with VR and try to change humanity forever but here's a number,' '' Mr. Luckey told GamesIndustry International, a gaming industry website, last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some game developers hoped <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> could help build a new gaming platform, a small-company alternative to an industry dominated by giants like <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>. With developer kits in hand, they were figuring out if <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> and its odd-looking visor were a part of their futures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few thought that meant a future that also included <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markus Persson, the maker of the popular game Minecraft, criticized <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> on his personal blog and on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. Mr. Persson said he had been in talks about bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus's game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just canceled that deal,'' Mr. Persson wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. ''<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> creeps me out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luckey took to message boards on the site Reddit to defend the sale. He wrote that the company would be allowed to operate independently of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and its advertisers, sell its virtual gaming hardware at a cheaper price, and keep the platform open to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am 100 percent certain that most people will see why this is good in the long term,'' Mr. Luckey wrote on Reddit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> donors were not so cynical. Ben Unsworth, president at the Canadian gaming company Globacore, was among the first to donate to Oculus's Kickstarter campaign in exchange for a developer kit and a copy of Doom 3, a version of the popular video game. Mr. Unsworth hacked together a game called PaperDude VR, a virtual reality homage to the video game paperboy from the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Unsworth said he thought the Oculus sale would help the company compete against the likes of <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> in gaming. His only complaint was that even though he was one of <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span>'s earliest backers on Kickstarter, he never did get the promised copy of Doom 3. And he was one of the last to receive the <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span> visor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So begins a cartoon advertisement referring to Ms. Zhang, an actress, for the latest retail investment product from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Alibaba used <span class="companylink">Sina Weibo</span>, a microblogging service in China, to announce its most recent push into innovative finance: a form of crowdfunding for Chinese movies. Investors were offered an expected annual interest rate of 7 percent for putting up as little as 100 renminbi, or $16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new investment product, called Yu Le Bao, or Entertainment Treasure, is marketed as a way for ordinary Chinese to play a minirole as a film producer. Alibaba said investors could suggest what films should be made and who should direct and star in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alibaba said an initial batch of four projects -- three films and one social networking game -- together were aiming for total financing of 73 million renminbi. They include a fourth installment in the ''Tiny Times'' series of films, as well as a screen adaptation of the popular 2004 novel ''Wolf Totem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yu Le Bao is the latest example of how Alibaba's novel online investment offerings are encroaching on the staid state-owned banking system. By offering returns of as much as 7 percent, about twice the maximum interest rate that traditional banks are permitted to pay on a benchmark savings deposit, Alibaba is steadily amassing a share of China's trillions of dollars in household savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alibaba is also moving forward with plans for an initial public offering of stock in the United States, which analysts have said could raise more than the $16 billion that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> achieved two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the company introduced a money market product called Yu'e Bao, which translates as Leftover Treasure. As of last month, 81 million people had signed up for the product, which had $40 billion in assets under management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of success has led to greater scrutiny from China's financial regulators. Reports in the state-run news media this month said the central bank, the <span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span>, was considering limits on the payments handled by Internet companies like Alibaba and its biggest rival, Tencent, but officials have yet to carry out such restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Alibaba's push into online finance has stoked a backlash from the state-dominated banking sector. On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</span>, the nation's biggest bank, started restricting its business with Alibaba's online payment unit to a single branch. In recent weeks, several of China's big state banks have begun capping the amount of money their customers can transfer into Internet finance products like those marketed by Alibaba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By setting its sights on China's movie industry, Alibaba is focusing on the world's fastest-growing major cinema market. Box-office sales in China grew 27 percent last year, to $3.6 billion, a total second only to the United States', according to figures released on Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Motion Picture Association of America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investments in Yu Le Bao would not go directly to financing movies. According to an email statement from Alibaba, ''in the initial phase,'' the money would be channeled into insurance and so-called wealth management products that were being offered by Guohua Life Insurance, which is based in Shanghai. They would later be invested in the cultural industry, the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another Weibo posting, Alibaba was careful to draw a distinction between the new investment product and traditional crowdfunding, where people who contribute money to a project usually receive goods or services in return. Depending on how it was structured, traditional crowdfunding would risk being seen by the Chinese authorities as illegal fund-raising, an offense that is not precisely defined but that has been used to condemn underground lending syndicates and pyramid schemes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crowdfunding projects can't offer returns on equity or investment, and the people behind those projects can't promise supporters any kind of profits,'' Alibaba said in the posting. ''This is innately different from Yu Le Bao's platform, which offers anticipated capital gains on insurance and wealth management products.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmer Luckey, a baby-faced 21-year-old college dropout, figured out how to build a virtual reality headset so exciting that it became a sensation on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, raising a staggering $2.4 million in 30 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Mr. Luckey wanted to set up his company in July 2012, he had difficulty figuring out how to complete the online paperwork and how to get tax IDs for his employees.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That did not matter -- he hired experienced entrepreneurs and business executives to take care of those kinds of details. And now, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has cast a $2 billion vote of confidence in the company, in a deal announced on Tuesday, saying it sees virtual reality as an essential platform for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> intends to incorporate the headset into its business is still unclear. But the acquisition has brought attention to virtual reality technologies, which offer the illusion of being physically present in a digital world, and to Mr. Luckey, and the vibrancy of the Southern California tech scene where his company took root.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luckey, who declined requests for an interview for this article but who was interviewed by The New York Times last year, grew up in Long Beach, Calif., where he was home-schooled by his parents. As a teenager, he developed a passion for virtual reality headsets and gaming consoles, scouring <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for older models and amassing a large collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also started a forum, ModRetro, dedicated to vintage hardware fans like himself, who took to modifying devices to refurbish them or reconfigure their abilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he was fascinated with the concept of virtual reality, the actual experience delivered by all of the headsets in his collection fell far short of the totally immersive ideal promised by science fiction. So he began tinkering with his own designs for a virtual reality headset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there had been a perfect headset, I wouldn't have gotten into virtual reality,'' he said in the interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luckey subsidized his habits by repairing broken iPhones and <span class="companylink">Nintendo</span> DS game devices in his parents' garage and selling them online for a profit. At the age of 16, he had a crude but working prototype of what would become the Oculus Rift, which he developed in his spare time while taking journalism classes at California State University, Long Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important break for him came in the summer of 2011, when he talked his way into a job at a virtual reality research lab at the <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span>, where he worked on research and projects around heads-up displays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big break came in 2012, when John Carmack, the developer of a game called Doom, reached out to him through the ModRetro forums and asked to purchase a version of the machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Luckey sent him a version at no cost, held together with duct tape, which Mr. Carmack used to show off a game at a demonstration in Los Angeles at E3, the largest gaming convention in the world. The audience loved it, and a mutual friend introduced Mr. Luckey to Brendan Iribe, an industry veteran who had also dropped out of college as a teenager to start a gaming company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Iribe, and others, helped Mr. Luckey begin the Kickstarter campaign that provided the seed money to establish <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span>, in Irvine, Calif., a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, the company joined a small but growing constellation of prominent companies that have emerged in the last few years in Los Angeles and its sprawling suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the teeming and densely concentrated cluster of start-ups competing for office space and venture dollars in San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area, the start-ups in Southern California are spread out over a handful of neighborhoods, like the sunny beaches of Venice and Santa Monica, Hollywood or downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs at these companies say they like the culture of Southern California because it is more relaxed and freer from distractions than the bustling tech epicenter of San Francisco. They make only the occasional trek north to the Bay Area to visit their investors and other founder friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to Oculus, the Los Angeles-area start-ups include Snapchat, Whisper, Tinder, Ether, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Factual. Los Angeles area start-ups attracted more than $1 billion in venture financing in 2013, up from $774 million in 2009, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, big-name technology companies, including <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and Tumblr, have also opened offices in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oculus acquisition ''shows a lot of strength,'' said James Jerlecki, who founded an anonymous messaging company, Rumr, which is based in Venice Beach, Calif. ''That kind of momentum is helping establish L.A.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtual reality experiences have long been dreamed about on screen and on the page, in science fiction books and films, but have been a hard sell for the real world. Over the last several decades, headsets that have promised to transport people into three-dimensional gaming and entertainment worlds have not lived up to their claims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oculus Rift is seen by many gaming and virtual reality aficionados as having the potential to finally cross over into the mainstream. But the company has yet to ship a consumer version of the product, which it says will be delivered this year or next. It has produced a version for developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies, including <span class="companylink">Sony</span>, have announced plans for their own versions of virtual gaming headsets. Still, since the demonstration at the E3 convention, Mr. Luckey and his Oculus Rift have been an indie darling among developers, earning accolades and awards at gaming conventions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And though investors were initially skeptical, they quickly whipped out their checkbooks once they got a taste of the hardware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santo Politi, a partner at the investment firm Spark Capital, for example, recalled the first time he tried the machinery last March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was absolutely mind-blowing,'' Mr. Politi said in an interview. ''I was speechless for the 10 minutes as I was going throughout the demo. You have to see and experience it or you don't get how amazing it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Politi invited Mr. Iribe to visit his firm. ''Before he left, our investors gave him a term sheet to invest in his company,'' Mr. Politi said. In June, Spark Capital led a $16 million investment in Oculus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Solana, the director of community at Founders Fund, a venture firm that also eventually invested in Oculus, said that he spent time with Mr. Luckey at a entrepreneurs' summit in Wyoming last June. He described Mr. Luckey as ''brilliant,'' saying ''his curiosity is almost without end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solana also said something that many who have met Mr. Luckey like to repeat: ''He also walks around barefoot at the office.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAFT breweries may be a big story in the media these days, but they face much tougher challenges than most other small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the rules governing how beer is distributed, known as franchise laws, which were written decades ago and today are being used to limit consumer choice by keeping small and start-up breweries from moving easily into new markets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost every state franchise law demands that breweries sign a strict contract with a single distributor in a state -- the so-called three-tiered system. The contracts not only prevent other companies from distributing a company's beers, but also give the distributor virtual carte blanche to decide how the beer is sold and placed in stores and bars -- in essence, the distributor owns the brand inside that state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This model was enacted in the 1970s, when the industry was a lot different: Back then there were fewer than 50 brewing companies in America and 5,000 distributors. Many small distributors carried beer only from one large brewer, and they needed protection in case the brewer they represented wanted to pull its product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today, while Big Beer remains big business, there are more than 2,700 breweries, and fewer than 1,000 viable distributors, so that relatively few distributors control huge sections of national territory, and each one can take on dozens of large and small breweries' brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, state laws continue to empower distributors to select brands and manage them however they want -- selling those they choose to sell, while letting other brands sit in their warehouses. The only recourse is to sue, and many small breweries lack even a fraction of the resources needed to take on a big distributor in court. As a result, they're stuck with the bad distributor, which severely hampers their ability to perform and grow as a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buy a small brewer a beer, and pretty soon he or she will be regaling you with war stories about fights with distributors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, I once tried to terminate a contract with an underperforming distributor in New York for not only selling my products outside of his territory, but selling out-of-date beer. I thought it would be straightforward, since my contract said I could leave ''with or without cause.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the distributor took us to court, saying the state's franchise law, which sets a high standard for showing cause, trumped whatever my contract said. Two State Supreme Court rulings upheld my position, but, fearing a further appeal, I settled out of court. I was freed from the contract, but the legal fees and settlement cost <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Brewery</span> more than $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories like this abound: My fellow craft brewers at Dogfish Head, in Delaware, faced a half-decade-long, six-figure legal dispute with a distributor just to terminate their contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even worse, some small brewers refuse to enter certain markets because of the local distributors' reputation. That's bad for these businesses, and bad for the economy, but particularly bad for consumers, who would love to try the latest popular craft beers but can't find them in their state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states have remedied the distribution inequities. In 2012 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and the State Legislature created a ''carve out'' from the state's beer franchise law for the smallest brewers: If your brewery represents less than 3 percent of a distributor's business, and you produce fewer than 300,000 barrels of beer a year (which covers all but the largest craft breweries), you can switch distributors by paying for the ''fair market value'' of the distribution rights, as negotiated by the brewer and distributor -- still an expensive proposition, but easier than going to court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Carolina has a similar law, while in Washington State, small brewers are excluded from the state's franchise laws completely. Just last week Michigan enacted a law allowing very small brewers to self-distribute. And several other states, including Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, are considering revising their beer laws to allow small brewers to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the craft-beer sector expands, states are waking up to the economic benefits it offers -- in jobs, tourism and taxes. Many states now offer subsidies and regulatory assistance for new breweries. But too few states have taken on the tougher job of pushing against distributors and their lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For small brewers, the flexibility to change distributors or distribute their own products is essential to gain access to markets, increase consumer choice, grow and pour money back into the economy. The success or failure of a beer should depend on whether consumers like it -- not on whether archaic distribution laws prevent them from finding it in the first place.</p>

Currently, only high-net-worth, high-income investors can legally invest in start-ups through crowdfunding sites. But soon, legislative and regulatory changes will open the sites to everyone.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is where the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, with its explicit mission to protect investors, is supposed to come in. But the agency's proposed crowdfunding rules, to be finalized in the months ahead, are a joke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how this happened. In an election-year sop to special interests, Congress passed a law in 2012 to end or loosen many bedrock investor protections, on the grounds that deregulation would make it easier for companies to raise money. Among its changes, the law, deceptively named the JOBS Act, called for the S.E.C. to write rules to establish a crowdfunding marketplace where companies could raise up to $1 million a year without having to meet disclosure and accounting standards that had long applied whenever private ventures raised money from the public. Perhaps the law's one and only saving grace was that it also required the S.E.C. to put in place new safeguards against the heightened potential in crowdfunding for big losses from fraudulent or unsuitable offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the law's most basic safeguard, Congress instructed the S.E.C. to limit the amount individuals can invest each year through crowdfunding as a way to limit the likely losses on inherently high-risk start-up investments. It gave the S.E.C. leeway to determine that limit, within certain parameters, based on an investor's income and assets. In its proposal, the agency opted for the most expansive formula possible. For example, a retiree with $25,000 in annual Social Security income and a nest egg of $100,000 would be allowed to invest up to $10,000 a year. That is way too much. If the agency had used the least expansive formula possible, the retiree's maximum would be $2,000 a year, which is still very risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law also required crowdfunding ''intermediaries,'' that is, the sites, to take steps to prevent fraud by start-ups featured on the sites. But the S.E.C.'s proposed rules basically let intermediaries satisfy the antifraud obligation by relying on the companies' own representations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And under the proposed rules, investors could end up with next to nothing even if they invested in the next big thing. Sophisticated investors often negotiate complex terms to ensure that they are amply rewarded for early-stage investments, even if later investors put up more money. The S.E.C. has acknowledged that everyday investors ''might not'' be able to negotiate the same terms -- which include ''anti-dilution provisions,'' ''superior liquidation preferences'' and other arcana. But its proposal only requires companies to disclose how early investments may be ''limited, diluted or qualified.'' It should instead require that shares issued through crowdfunding incorporate the terms that sophisticated investors routinely demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed crowdfunding rules need to be thoroughly reworked. If the five commissioners and their staffs cannot agree on a worthy set of protections, a majority on the commission should refuse to finalize the rules that emerge.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- The Chinese government on Wednesday announced a modest package of economic stimulus measures, the latest sign of concern by Beijing that growth may be slowing more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">State Council</span>, China's cabinet, decided at a meeting to extend tax breaks for small and very small enterprises through 2016 and said it was considering a significant broadening of those breaks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council also gave a strong hint that it was preparing a broader response to recent signs of economic weakness, which have included lackluster business orders, industrial production and investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Officials attending Wednesday's cabinet meeting also said China will improve macrocontrol in 2014 with measures to stimulate enterprises, expand domestic consumption and boost employment,'' the government said in a statement distributed shortly before midnight by <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span>, the state-controlled news agency. ''There will also be fiscal help in coping with unexpected challenges.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement contained few other details, except to mention that railroad construction would be carried out rapidly and the renovation of rundown urban neighborhoods would continue. China plans to open 6,600 kilometers, or 4,100 miles, of new rail lines this year, an increase of 1,000 kilometers, or 620 miles, from last year. Prime Minister Li Keqiang had said the government would build or renovate homes for 4.7 million people currently living in makeshift shelters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China also intervened in currency markets on a huge scale in late February and through March, issuing torrents of renminbi so as to buy up dollars. That had the effect of at least temporarily driving down the value of the renminbi about 1 percent, which helps make Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets. The extra renminbi moving through the economy also brought down short-term interest rates, making it easier for troubled real estate developers and other large borrowers to continue borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the scale of China's measures so far is much smaller than in 2009, during the global financial crisis. China limited its slowdown then with a huge spending program. The nation's central bank also expanded China's broadly measured money supply on a scale that dwarfed what the Federal Reserve achieved in the United States with its ''quantitative easing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese leaders have called repeatedly since then for a shift toward consumption-led growth, but achieving that has proved difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Asian Development Bank</span> in a report on Tuesday called for governments across Asia, including China's, to adjust their fiscal policies to promote economic growth that is more inclusive of the poor. Zhuang Juzhong, the deputy chief economist of the Manila-based regional lending institution, said in an interview in Hong Kong on Wednesday that China relies heavily on consumption taxes to finance government spending, which does little to address the country's gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumption taxes, mainly a value-added tax that reaches 17 percent for a wide range of consumer goods, represent almost half of government revenues in China. That compares with less than a third of government revenues in most affluent countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, China has struggled to figure out how to introduce property taxes, which would tend to fall more heavily on the rich, and collects only a tenth of government revenues through personal income taxes, compared with roughly a third for affluent countries.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEXICO CITY -- In Hollywood terms, it was small change. But for Miguel Coyula, a Cuban filmmaker accustomed to working on a tiny budget, the $5,200 he raised on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo.com last year would have bought some lighting equipment, a Steadicam and a tripod, all crucial for his science-fiction feature, ''Blue Heart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Indiegogo suspended the campaign in August and froze the money after determining that transferring funds to Cuba or a Cuban resident would violate the United States' economic embargo.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like someone pulling the rug from under your feet,'' said Mr. Coyula, who spoke in English by phone from Havana. ''That was when I realized I was really on my own, that making a movie in Cuba is hard because both the Cuban government makes it difficult, and the American government makes it difficult.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cuban filmmaking has changed significantly in recent years, as the state's role has shrunk, digital technology has made independent productions more feasible, and the Internet has opened tantalizing avenues to funding. More and more of the contemporary Cuban movies selected for international festivals like the Havana Film Festival New York, which runs through Friday, are made with little or no input from state institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What hasn't changed, however, are the financial and legal restrictions that make transferring money to Cuba illegal without a special license from the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Those restrictions also prevent Americans from investing in Cuban movies and prohibit Americans from making most films on the island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the United States government dedicates millions of dollars each year to programs intended to promote civil society and democracy there, experts on Cuban film say the embargo is hindering the growth of a cinema that is increasingly independent of the state and often offers a raw reflection of Cuban life or pokes fun at the government. Movies like ''Pablo'' (2012), by Yosmani Acosta, which deals with domestic violence, and ''Chamaco'' (2010), by Juan Carlos Cremata, about male prostitution, explore subjects discussed on the street but rarely in the news media. Mr. Coyula's 2010 movie, ''Memories of Overdevelopment,'' includes a scene in which the protagonist talks to a walking cane with a dog's head as if he were addressing Fidel Castro. ''Lie to me some more,'' he tells it. At a screening in Havana, the audience burst into applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Precisely as independent filmmakers are telling stories in new ways, using new genres, exploring Cuban reality in ways that even hard-liners in the U.S. would see as positive, the embargo is preventing them'' from accessing American capital and exchanging ideas and know-how with their American counterparts, said Ann Marie Stock, director of film and media studies at the College of William and Mary, who has written a book on independent Cuban film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sanctions prohibit most people under American jurisdiction from investing in or trading with Cuba, or traveling there without a license from the Treasury office. Financial institutions have been fined hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years for handling Cuban transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A representative of the office would not comment on how the economic sanctions apply to film, but the guidelines published on the Treasury's website stipulate that Americans may only make a movie in Cuba as part of a research project. Thus documentaries are among the few productions allowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say the worlds of Cuban and American filmmaking have been disconnected. Under the Obama administration, cultural ties between the two countries have increased, as regulations restricting travel loosened, and the United States granted more visas to Cuban artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Kilmurry, executive director of the PBS documentary series ''POV,'' will visit Cuba this month to show American documentaries as part of a tour organized by the nonprofit Americas Media Initiative, which distributes Cuban productions overseas. Thousands of American students visit Cuba each year to make documentaries, write articles, study film, music and fine art, or carry out research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The embargo is not the only, or the biggest, hindrance to film production. Directors and experts say the Cuban government does its part in hampering filmmakers, keeping politically provocative movies out of theaters, not recognizing private production companies, and making it hard for filmmakers to obtain permits for, say, filming on the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's absurd that we are in the 21st century, and we have no legal framework for independent producers,'' said the director Esteban Insausti, whose 2010 feature, ''Long Distance,'' explores emigration and the trauma of separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the threat of prosecution by the Treasury Department and the complicated process for getting a license are enough to make many organizations back away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ubaldo Huerta, a Cuban technology expert who lives in Barcelona, shut down Yagruma, a crowdfunding platform specifically for Cuban projects, in February 2013, a little more than a year after he started it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site financed 11 projects, for example raising 1,200 euros (about $1,650) to help make ''The Last Act,'' a vivid stop-motion short by Harold Rensoli. But in August 2012, <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, which was processing payments for Yagruma, suspended Mr. Huerta's account out of concern that the site was violating the embargo. Mr. Huerta explored the possibility of a license from the Treasury office, but said he was told by officials it would be turned down. He suspended the site rather than risk a fine, and was unable to find a <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> alternative that didn't have American connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a way of supporting Cubans, of building a bridge,'' Mr. Huerta said. ''But I was playing with fire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiegogo, meanwhile, declined to comment on Mr. Coyula's case, saying in a statement that ''we must follow American law, which at this time prohibits transferring money to Cuba.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Coyula said that Indiegogo returned most of the contributions from the campaign's 57 backers, who had donated $20 to $500 apiece. ''Blue Heart,'' which will use newsreels, animé and fiction to tell the story of a failed experiment to create a perfect revolutionary through genetic engineering, will cost about $30,000 to make, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexandra Halkin, director of the Americas Media Initiative, said that crowdfunding had opened a window -- however briefly -- in a country where there are few nonprofit foundations to fund the arts and little government support, and where filmmakers are often disqualified from grants from American institutions because of the embargo. Mr. Rensoli, who used his Yagruma proceeds to buy a camera that allowed him to create a streaking effect that suggests motion in a still photo, said he has had no luck raising money since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-American sources are available, and Cuba has co-produced dozens of movies with production companies from countries like Spain, France and Mexico or with financing, for example, from Ibermedia, a state-sponsored program to fund Latin films. But money from Spain, for example, has become much harder to obtain because of the economic slump there. And the United States would be a ''natural funder'' of Cuban film, Ms. Halkin said, given the countries' shared history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huerta said he does not believe the embargo was meant to thwart such projects. ''We're collateral damage,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That damage comes in different guises. Alejandro Brugués, a Cuban-Argentine filmmaker, twice tried to get Dolby to certify the sound quality of his films, but Dolby turned down his requests because he was working in Cuba.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They basically said, 'No, and we can't have any contact with you,' '' Mr. Brugués said by phone from Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brugués, whose €2.5-million zombie movie, ''Juan of the Dead,'' was financed via Spain, said that he would have to shoot his latest movie, about a Cuban heist, elsewhere because it had American backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Cuban workers, that means missing out on contracts worth thousands of dollars, which could boost the island's clutch of new production companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Insausti said artists should keep testing the barriers set up by both countries. For ''Long Distance,'' for example, the Cuban government allowed Zulema Clares, a Cuban actress living in New York, to return to the island. ''You have to push the line and see what happens,'' he said. ''Maybe it moves a little.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, though, experts said, the American film industry is missing the chance to use the island as a production site and exchange ideas with Cuban filmmakers, who for decades have relied on Europe for backing and co-productions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We in the U.S. are limiting ourselves from hooking up with some real, young talent,'' Ms. Stock said. ''These folks will go places, but they'll go there with Spanish, Mexican production companies and not with U.S. companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''We are missing opportunities, both economically and creatively.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founders: Basha Frost Rubin and Mirra Levitt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees: Six full-time, two part-time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location: New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded: September 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pitch: Priori Legal is a web platform that helps businesses find lawyers for specific tasks and services. When Ms. Rubin and Ms. Levitt were classmates at Yale Law School they worked in legal clinics and saw how valuable a good lawyer can be to a small business. ''The right legal advice can make a difference in whether or not a business is successful,'' Ms. Rubin said. ''We saw people in business not using legal services when they needed it, because the cost for a lawyer was too high and they didn't know how to assess price and value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How It Works: To be listed on Priori's site, lawyers must agree to discount their fees 25 percent and provide transparency on pricing, tasks and timing. They offer both hourly rates and fixed rates. For fixed-fee packages, many of which are customized by lawyers for Priori, clients are told the fee and exactly what legal services are included. Whenever possible, lawyers estimate additional expenses related to their services, like filing fees. To be part of the site, lawyers fill out a comprehensive online application and the company does reference checks and conducts interviews. About 25 percent of the lawyers who apply are accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When businesses or individuals submit a request for a lawyer, they receive a hand-selected list of three to five lawyers in the Priori network who are appropriate for the matter -- and a free half-hour consultation. Priori handles all of the back-office work for its lawyers, including billing, invoicing and collection of fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The platform offers tools and analytics to help businesses track and manage relationships with multiple lawyers. ''A lot of smaller companies,'' Ms. Rubin said, ''don't know how to budget for legal services, because it's traditionally been hourly and unpredictable. We really believe in fixed fees, because that certainty for business owners is very helpful.'' About 75 percent of the lawyers listed offer fixed-fee pricing, which can range from $400 to $1,750 for trademark services, from $400 to $1,000 for independent contractor agreements, and from $515 to $4,000 to form a limited liability corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing: Clients pay Priori 10 percent of what they pay their lawyers. The company has raised more than $2 million from friends and family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traction: The company started in Manhattan, and that's where the bulk of its clients and lawyers are located. It does offer some services nationwide, including assistance with intellectual property, tax and immigration issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site features about 100 lawyers in New York City and a handful in other states, Ms. Rubin said. Lawyers accepted into the Priori network typically have at least five years of experience and range in age from 30 to 65. They can be solo practitioners or work for firms with as many as 50 lawyers. Priori's applicant pool has doubled each month since December, and the company has served hundreds of clients in New York state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Cohen, an angel investor, entrepreneur and chairman of the New York Angels, said that although the New York start-up community is always looking for entrepreneur-friendly services, ''seed-financed start-ups usually have secured a friendly, quality firm for their financing and will not feel that a 25 percent reduction in price will be enough to switch for other matters.'' On the other hand, Mr. Cohen said, some start-ups may feel more price and time pressures, and for them, ''Priori's service may be a good way to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-five percent of those who take a free phone consultation go on to hire a lawyer through the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Client Example: Sarah LaFleur, founder and chief executive of M.M. LaFleur, an online fashion company based in New York City, has a lawyer at a large firm she uses. But she recently had a question about the taxes her 10 employees should pay, and because it was such a specific question, she decided to try using a Priori attorney to answer it. ''We went from being complete strangers to her becoming my lawyer and answering my questions very fast,'' Ms. LaFleur said. The task took a little less than three hours, and the attorney charged $840, or $300 an hour, which Ms. LaFleur thought was fair. ''Often as start-ups,'' she said, ''we run into the situation where we have a legal question but are afraid it will cost $700 to ask it, so we don't ask it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges: Spreading the word in a world focused on technology and apps. ''We are connecting you to real lawyers,'' Ms. Rubin said. ''We're not making lawyers go away, and we're not an app. That makes it hard, sometimes, to have our voices heard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is doing more marketing and is holding seminars in New York to discuss legal issues for small businesses. The site has added a blog that features posts from its network of lawyers. ''We are also in the process of creating partnerships with organizations that serve small businesses,'' Ms. Rubin said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDFor a couple of years now, a number of entrepreneurs have been racing to solve the same problem: the financial services industry's persistent inability to provide personalized advice and appropriate investments at a reasonable price to customers who are not rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was easy at first for established players to dismiss companies like Betterment, Wealthfront and LearnVest as robo-advisers, niche services or certain failures. That line of thinking wrote their offerings off as training wheels for know-nothing young adults until they graduated to a grown-up, gray-haired financial adviser -- even though these start-ups gathered piles of fancy venture capital money.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent developments suggest that those new players may be something more than the starter homes of the personal finance world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betterment, which builds and manages investment portfolios of index and exchange-traded funds, realized that 20 percent of its assets were from customers over the age of 50. They were asking for advice on withdrawing their retirement money, and the company is now introducing a service to assist them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the index fund giant Vanguard, whose investment products are often at the heart of the portfolios that these new services are building for their own customers. It is now piloting an offering of its own that nearly matches the new players on price while offering unlimited financial planning along with investment management. That's something that most of the new ''we'll run your money for you'' companies don't offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanguard's full-service offering, called Personal Advisor Services, costs 0.3 percent annually of the assets it's managing. For now, customers need $100,000 in accounts there to join, but the company plans to drop the minimum to $50,000 at some point soon. An existing Vanguard service that resembles the new one costs 0.7 percent annually on the first $1 million and requires at least $500,000 on balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This new program, which has no wait list for now but may add one if too many people sign up, may not work, though Vanguard has spent more than two years planning and testing it. But by extending both investment advice and planning to many more customers and asking them to pay less than half of what some of its other customers already pay, Vanguard is all but admitting that the start-ups were right in identifying an enormous advice gap in the financial services industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With this week's column, we're introducing a chart on our site that lists these companies and explains their pricing and services. For now, we've limited it to services that will help you pick the right index funds or similar investments and rebalance them over time, while charging you less than 0.50 percent of your money each year. Some of the companies charge monthly fees (or no fees at all, like WiseBanyan). We will update this chart as companies come and go and offerings change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that so many start-ups have jumped into this space speaks to a problem with a basic business model that has plagued the financial advice industry for decades. Helping people sort through their investments, budgets, employee benefits, taxes, estate planning and insurance takes time. No two clients are exactly alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If advisers earn their compensation through commissions from investment or insurance companies, then they're likely to favor those funds and policies. This often isn't in the best interest of the customers, most of whom ought to be in low-cost index funds. And the better index funds and similar investments tend to come from companies that don't pay commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers can pay advisers directly, and many do pay them 1 percent each year of the money under management. But a large number of the best advisers won't get out of bed for less than $5,000 or $10,000 annually (drawn from a $500,000 or $1,000,000 portfolio), given the amount of time and resources it takes to do right by a client. Some others charge by the hour and still agree to work in a client's best interest, but plenty of customers dislike being on the clock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people need no professional help at all. They don't mind spending time managing their finances. They invest in the right things, don't bail out when the markets go bonkers and don't have messy financial situations resulting from inheritances or disabled children or small business tax complications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But companies like Betterment and Wealthfront realized that many other people wanted a bit of hand-holding when it came to investments. So they built easy-to-use sites that sought customers' goals and risk tolerance and then put the money in a portfolio of index or exchange-traded funds. To address the question about what these random entrepreneurs know about investing, both companies cite decades of research about the right way to construct their collections of investments and rebalance customer holdings when markets rise and fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Security is a slightly different question. An event like the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff is exceedingly rare but never entirely impossible, though thieving financial planners do steal money stored with well-known third-party companies, too. Some faith is necessary with any financial services start-up. At the same time, the power of legacy brand names can allow many financial service companies to collect much more in fees than they deserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betterment charges from 0.15 to 0.35 percent of the money under management annually, while Wealthfront runs the first $10,000 without charge and then takes 0.25 percent annually after that. LearnVest takes a different approach, charging a flat setup fee plus continuing monthly fees for advice about your financial life, though it doesn't make specific investment recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanguard casts no aspersions on either approach, and it may well start a service someday that does exactly what Betterment and Wealthfront do. Though its origins are in helping people who want to make their own investment decisions, it's now reacting to the growing number of calls from people who don't know whether they've saved enough and aren't sure how to start spending what they have saved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are increasingly saying, 'How can you help me in more of an ongoing advisory capacity?' '' said Karin Risi, a Vanguard principal in advice services and asset management. ''This is a big investment and a big aspirational move to say, 'Yes, we want to help many more clients.' '' Vanguard plans to move existing customers who are already paying 0.7 percent annually for their advice into the new, less expensive service before too long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betterment's new feature feeds a similar need for additional advice. Jon Stein, the company's 34-year-old founder and chief executive, built a product that he wanted to use. But then he started hearing from customers decades older who needed help taking money out as opposed to putting money away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To assist them, the company created a feature that calculates (and can automatically distribute) a safe monthly withdrawal. You tell it how long you expect to live and your risk tolerance, though the tool's default assumptions are that you will last until 90, that you want a 99 percent chance of not outliving your money and that inflation will run at a 3 percent annual clip. Then it provides a suggested monthly check that comes from a single Betterment account. For now, the tool can't optimize withdrawals based on the tax advantages of pulling money from, say, a regular individual retirement account versus a Roth I.R.A., but the company will add that in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many traditional financial planners are crossing their fingers and hoping no all-out price war breaks out, there is already some pricing innovation around the edges. New this month is a service called the XY Planning Network. Michael Kitces, a co-founder, had long observed an intense frustration among his younger financial planning peers who couldn't afford to serve average people in their 20s and 30s without pushing bad investments and inappropriate insurance on them. The network will pair consumers up with planners who are willing to work on a monthly retainer and make money only from the fees they charge their customers. The network is considering teaming up with Betterment to handle investments so its planners can focus on all of the other aspects of their customers' financial lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That potential pairing suggests the possibility that all of these services are, in fact, complementary and not competitive, but you wouldn't know it by viewing a hysterical video making the rounds in the industry. Set to spooky music, it warns consumers about robo-advisers and reminds them that ''you are a person, not a number; you're an individual, not an algorithm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Betterment and Wealthfront can have their algorithms help run portfolios, and human advisers at LearnVest and XY Planning Network and the more traditional financial planning and wealth management firms can hold the hands of beginners and help people as their financial lives get more complex. Vanguard will try to do it all without charging very much for the privilege, and other brand-name companies will no doubt jump in with their own efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of these players will survive, but their sheer number will probably bring prices down even further or force established advisers to do more to justify their existing fees. As long as nobody runs off with the money, consumers stand to gain over the long term from all of the people now clamoring to do the best job of helping them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 15, 2014, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Your Money column on Saturday, about online sites that offer inexpensive investment services, misstated one of the assumptions in a calculator provided by one such site, Betterment. The calculator's default setting assumes that users want a 99 percent chance of not outliving their money, not a 99 percent chance of outliving their money. A chart accompanying the article also misstated, in some editions, the investment minimum for another site, Wealthfront. The minimum is $5,000, not $0.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING Behavioral psychology books are a guilty pleasure. I read them 85 percent for understanding end-user behavior and 15 percent for understanding myself. The most recent one I read was ''Contagious,'' by Jonah Berger. It's an analysis of viral marketing through the lens of applied psychology. The last fiction book I read was ''Reamde,'' by Neal Stephenson. He writes science fiction that is on the edge of plausible.</p>

A lot of cyclists care deeply what they hear when they ride. Some hubs have a supple, wholesome, tongue-clicking sound while others can have a kind of rattling, horrible sound. I'm a big fan of DT Swiss hubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At work, I put in 32-decibel-blocking earplugs. And then over them I put on full-cup, noise-canceling headphones and then I play some sort of monotonous drum music in them.

To get me out of my crazy earplug-and-headphone thing is a lot of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WATCHING I watched the premiere of ''Silicon Valley'' on HBO. I enjoyed it. But I wondered if most people would get the insider jokes, like there's a shot of a C.E.O. lying down on a table and he's wearing those five-toed rubberized shoes. <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Sergey Brin wears them all the time. So it was a nod -- just in case you haven't figured out what company they were talking about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOLLOWING News clips and videos from Ukraine. I don't have much family left there but all the family I do have is in Crimea. Kiev is where I grew up so I know all the places where they had the fires and barricades. I walked those streets. And Crimea, that's where I spent my summers because that's where my grandmother and her family are from. It's a no-win proposition what's happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MODIFYING I relax by fine-tuning various kitchen processes and recipes using approaches borrowed from genetic algorithms. I approach a recipe as if it were a genome where every ingredient and process in the recipe is a gene that I modify randomly. I use a computer program so the modifications are truly random. I basically recombine the genetic makeup of the best recipes over and over again until I come up with what tastes the best. It's a fun way to nerd out and in the end you get something really tasty. I did it with pickles, kimchi and most recently with molten chocolate lava cake. I choose anything with a small number of ingredients and a simple process.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROME -- The small businesses were sprinkled throughout the Italian capital: One restaurant was only a few blocks from the Senate. A cafe was at the edge of the upscale diplomatic district, while a gelato shop was near the Pantheon. There was even a hotel not far from the hilltop statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the hero of Italy's unification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city where government and tourism are engines of the local economy, these storefront businesses seemed typical until a police crackdown exposed them as money-laundering fronts for mob organizations based in southern Italy. During January and February alone, Italian officials seized 51 million euros, or about $70 million, in mob properties and other assets in Rome, providing a small glimpse of the legal business interests that southern clans control in the capital.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crackdown in Rome exposed just a small corner of what officials describe as a mob economy that has rapidly expanded across Europe. In an era of austerity, with Italy awash in debt and struggling to recover, organized crime groups are sitting on mountains of cash. They have taken advantage of the economic crisis to accelerate their infiltration of legitimate businesses outside their southern Italian strongholds and now control commercial interests in Rome and Milan, as well as in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, Spain and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the last 20 years, they have a lot of liquidity,'' said Michele Prestipino, the prosecutor who oversaw the recent crackdown and seizures in Rome. ''This is a problem today. They have too much money. They can't invest it all. It is the opposite of what happens to regular entrepreneurs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Europe once thought of organized crime families as largely an Italian problem -- and if many Italians thought the problem was mostly confined to the south -- the breadth of their assets across the Continent is forcing a reappraisal. In February, the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> passed a new directive making it easier for national authorities to confiscate criminal assets, in response to evidence that organized crime groups have gobbled up properties and companies across Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say Europe must introduce tough organized crime laws, like those that already exist in Italy, and expand law enforcement efforts. Some say the same focus that is applied to fighting terrorism should be applied to confronting organized crime. Besides Italian mob groups, experts say, other criminal organizations, including ones from Albania, China and Russia, are also moving into legal business sectors in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Democracies underestimate the fight against the Mafia,'' said Giuseppe Lumia, a senator and member of Italy's Anti-Mafia Commission. ''Mafias have become global. They do business, and do money laundering, between countries. But the anti-Mafia agencies are national and local.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining how much cash Italy's mob organizations turn over in a single year from illegal activities is extremely difficult, with estimates varying widely, from about €10 billion, or about $14 billion, to as high as €220 billion, or about $304 billion. One of Italy's largest business associations, Confesercenti, has estimated that organized crime accounts for roughly €130 billion, or about $180 billion, in annual turnover -- about 7 percent of Italy's gross domestic product. Confesercenti also estimated that the organized crime groups had roughly €65 billion, or about $90 billion, in cash reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have amounts of money that are incredible,'' said David Ellero, a specialist in Italian organized crime at <span class="companylink">Europol</span>, the European law enforcement agency. ''In some investigations, the flows of cash were so conspicuous that rather than counting it, it was being weighed on scales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The richest organized crime family is believed to be the 'Ndrangheta, (pronounced n-DRANG-gay-tah) a group from the Calabria region that now controls much of Europe's cocaine trade. Analysts say the 'Ndrangheta is active in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. The other two main organizations are the Camorra, the clans based in the Naples area, which are especially powerful in southern Spain; and the Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian mob families depicted in ''The Godfather,'' which are active across Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their home regions, Italy's organized crime groups often operate as shadow states, infiltrating local politics while controlling territory through intimidation and violence. Analysts say this local dominance explains why the organizations are heavily involved in sectors such as construction, mining, waste management and transportation, where their political influence allows them to steer government contracts to their favored firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In northern Italy and in other European countries, mob groups operate far less conspicuously, analysts say, especially since they lack the same level of political or territorial influence. But a report presented recently to <span class="companylink">European Union</span> officials concluded that mob tentacles were nearly everywhere: hotels, nightclubs, real estate, gambling, construction, retail gasoline sales, wholesaling of clothing and jewelry, food processing, health care, renewable energy and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have specific preferences for certain sectors,'' said Michele Riccardi, a researcher at Transcrime, the research institute in Milan that compiled the report presented to the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. ''These are the sectors that seem more vulnerable and the regulations are looser.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy has Europe's toughest anti-mob statutes, which is one reason many organized crime families have pushed into other European countries. Germany has become an especially prominent case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italian migrants began pouring into Germany in the 1950s, including many from Calabria, home of the 'Ndrangheta. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, analysts say wiretaps detected a mob boss in Italy ordering a lieutenant to get into East Germany immediately and ''buy everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel wrote about a trial in Cologne in which investigators have accused mobsters linked to the Cosa Nostra of bilking the state of millions of euros by issuing fake invoices from shell construction companies. German officials say the presence of organized crime poses a threat to the country's building sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magazine cited a confidential overview by the Federal Criminal Police Office that criticized the <span class="companylink">German government</span> for failing to detect the assets of organized crime groups. The overview found that Italian crime groups had earned about €123 million, roughly $170 million, in Germany during the past decade, yet prosecutors had confiscated just €8 million, or about $11 million, from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police report found that while the Cosa Nostra had infiltrated the construction sector, the Camorra was peddling counterfeit consumer goods and the 'Ndrangheta was selling adulterated olive oil and other foodstuffs. Mobsters controlled at least 300 pizzerias in Germany, it said, and were using these businesses to enter the legitimate economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Germany and other <span class="companylink">European Union</span> countries once denied the existence of a problem, awareness has begun to rise. In February, the Italian and German authorities carried out a joint operation against the Cosa Nostra and arrested more than a dozen suspects in both countries who are accused of stealing millions of euros in <span class="companylink">European Union</span> farm subsidies. This month, the Italian and French police collaborated in the arrest of a Camorra boss in Nice, France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> set up an anti-Mafia commission, while <span class="companylink">Europol</span> recognized in 2011 that it had an ''intelligence gap'' about mob activities. It commissioned a broad survey, released last year, which noted that mob groups were particularly threatening in legal business sectors because they ''can afford to operate 'at a loss,' creating in the long run a situation of quasi-monopoly that undermines the basic principles of free market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even within Italy, however, many people continue to regard organized crime as a southern problem. When the writer Roberto Saviano, known for his work exposing the activities of organized crime groups, used a 2010 television program to speak out about mob infiltration in the north, the Milan-based newspaper Il Giornale responded with an online petition drive against him titled, ''Dear Saviano, the North is not Mafioso.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Criminal organizations are all in Rome and up north,'' Mr. Saviano said in a recent interview. ''In the south, their presence is like a military presence. In Rome and the north, it is economic presence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mob groups have long been a quiet presence in Rome, with shopkeepers complaining of having to pay extortion money, known as pizzo, but the recent crackdown showed how organized crime groups are now directly investing in city businesses. Among the 23 restaurants and pizzerias seized in January was Pizza Ciro, part of one of the most popular pizza chains in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has nothing to do with cash being in the register at the end of the day,'' said Enrico Fontana, director of Libera, an umbrella group of anti-mob associations around Italy. ''It is for money laundering.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Prestipino, the prosecutor, agreed that money laundering was important but added that the crime bosses are also looking for ways to create channels of access to political leaders. He said no politician can meet directly with a mob boss, but by investing in businesses, organized crime groups can cultivate a network of white-collar entrepreneurs in Rome who can deal openly with politicians and civil servants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a system that has all advantages,'' Mr. Prestipino said. ''The businessman gets the economic advantages. The Mafioso doesn't have to come to Rome. And the politician doesn't have to get his hands dirty.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JUST about every major tech success -- from <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to LinkedIn to Instagram -- started with angel investors taking a chance. These risk takers ended up being richly rewarded for their early investments, and no doubt they have inspired would-be angels to search for the next big thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such success, though, is highly unlikely in the dicey business of angel investing. Many investments go to zero, or they languish in a start-up that never really takes off or attracts buyers. It's no wonder people brag so fulsomely about the winners.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David S. Rose, a prominent angel investor in New York and a member of one of the city's wealthiest real estate families, argues in his new book, ''Angel Investing: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Start-ups'' (Wiley, 2014), that more people can and should become angel investors, and that a few big wins make up for all the losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Angel investing is a legitimate part of an alternative asset class investment portfolio,'' Mr. Rose said. ''A rational person can be an investor and not a gambler.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every adviser agrees. ''There is a lotto ticket element to angel investing,'' said Michael Tiedemann, chief investment officer at Tiedemann Wealth Management, which oversees $9.2 billion. ''The risk is most people are not going to see the best deals unless you are really well connected in the industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I decided to look more closely at the assertions in Mr. Rose's book and ask some experienced angel investors for their insights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ANGEL PROFILE At the outset of his book, Mr. Rose promotes annual returns of 25 percent for angel investors. It's the kind of number that makes certain people swoon and open their checkbooks. But Mr. Rose makes clear that such returns are possible only with a lot of patience and money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said angel investors needed to build a portfolio of at least 20 different companies with stakes in each in the range of $25,000 to $50,000. This process could take years. They also need to have at least half of that amount held in reserve for additional investments to either prop up a struggling company or maintain the same percentage stake as the investor base expands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most successful angels also have some knowledge about specific industries to help them find the 20 percent of start-ups that have a chance to succeed -- keeping in mind that at least half of them will fail. The investor should limit his angel investments to no more than 10 percent of his overall portfolio, with the rest diversified among the usual asset classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even then, ''if you don't like risk, don't become an angel investor,'' Mr. Rose said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet one of his arguments is that angel investing is not limited to billionaires or their children. Rather he recommends it for people who meet the relatively low standard of being an accredited investor -- that is, annual income exceeding $200,000 for two consecutive years or possessing assets of $1 million, not including the primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But given the amount of money that he says needs to be invested in start-ups to have a shot at success, many who would qualify as accredited investors would still fall short of Mr. Rose's own capital standards for becoming an angel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By his calculation, an angel would need at least $500,000 to invest a minimum of $25,000 across 20 deals. Add in reserves, and we're up to $750,000. If that pot of money is supposed to be only 10 percent of an investment portfolio, an angel would then need at least $7.5 million in liquid assets -- well beyond the reach of most affluent investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH-STAKES GAMBLE What entices someone to take on so much risk at Las Vegas-like odds of success? Many of the reasons are only partly related to financial gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John O. Huston, a former commercial banker and risk officer, said he was bored in retirement and figured he could use his ability to assess risk to be an angel investor. But he quickly invested in a large number of companies without doing enough research -- and his initial portfolio didn't perform well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it was as simple as following best practices, McKinsey would have bottled it up, and all the venture capitalists would have stellar returns,'' Mr. Huston said, referring to the consulting firm. But despite his initial lack of success, he said he still enjoyed meeting young entrepreneurs as part of the investment process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Holliday said she became an angel investor after selling her digital advertising company to <span class="companylink">Publicis</span>. She wanted to stay current. ''Most angels are not looking for income because the returns are so erratic,'' she said. ''For me this is really, really interesting and to help these businesses through problems you've already dealt with in your career -- it's like owning racehorses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odds are much the same as at the racetrack. Two of her investments went bankrupt. But two others won the start-up equivalent of the Kentucky Derby, getting sold to Amazon and Motorola for the type of high multiples that angel investors chase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE INVESTMENT MODEL While Mr. Rose lays out a template to be an angel investor, it is certainly not easy to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going it alone, even if someone follows his precepts, is difficult, both in terms of finding deals and having time to do the necessary research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one reason Ms. Holliday joined New York Angels, an angel investor group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huston is now the manager of Ohio TechAngels, a group of 330 investors who pool their money to invest in start-ups. The most recent fund, its fourth, has $7.3 million to invest, with $3.6 million from 98 investors and the rest from the state of Ohio in matching funds. He said members could go in with a minimum of $30,000 and were capped at $120,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once potential deals are discovered, another challenge is evaluating the idea and the entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rose passed on an opportunity to invest in what became <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>, which is now worth more than $3 billion and, he said, returned 500 times what some early angels invested. At the time, the company, then called Tote, operated as a shopping site where you could pin what you wanted to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The shopping thing didn't work out. But the pinning thing did, and they changed their name to <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> before they ran out of money,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other investments, like ComiXology -- digitized comics -- Mr. Rose said he believed in the entrepreneurs as much as the idea. That company was sold to Amazon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing at a low valuation is also important to get a big return. To make up for the failures and stragglers, angels should aim for a return of at least 30 times their investment. So people need to invest when the company has a low valuation, preferably under $2 million, Mr. Rose said. The higher the initial valuation, the more unlikely it is that the company will sell for enough to generate a strong return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you invest at a $1 million valuation, it only takes a $30 million valuation to get that return,'' he said. ''The average company is acquired for in the $30 million to $50 million range.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS Even angels with the best intentions and investing protocols run into problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not being realistic about all the challenges facing a start-up is one. After all, an investment may look great on paper, but it could still collapse before the company is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Schneider, who sold his prescriptions processing company after 25 years and became a full-time angel investor in 2006, said he hadn't had any big hits yet -- and he also passed on investing in <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm way ahead on paper,'' he said. ''But you can't say success just because the companies have raised additional rounds at a greater valuation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said one company he invested in raised additional money at a valuation 10 times higher than he invested in, only to go bankrupt. Still, he became an angel investor knowing he could lose all the money he put into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not learning from mistakes can also be a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huston said the first fund raised by Ohio TechAngels in 2004 would just be able to return investors' money, if it could sell one more company for $1 million. In other words, after a decade, that money has lost value to inflation. But he said the group had gotten better about how it makes investments, the structure of its investments and the tax breaks available for investing in start-up companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought the analogue was gambling, but it's warfare,'' he said. ''Throughout history there have been so many examples of the superior force not winning the battle. I liken angel investing to that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for returns, angel investors tend to emphasize the major successes. Dave Berkus, an entrepreneur in California, made 65 times his investment in <span class="companylink">GameSpy Industries</span> when it was acquired by a private equity company. He said he made 110 times his investment in Green Dot, which issues prepaid credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they are two of only four companies that he counts as big hits. Of the 108 deals he has made since 1993, 26 companies have gone bankrupt and about 50 are unlikely ever to be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ninety percent of the money I ever made as an angel investor came from four investments,'' Mr. Berkus said. ''It's the gambler's mentality mitigated by the ability to select intelligently.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDIt was that rare thing, scarcely seen in the financial world since the debut of the A.T.M. or microfinancing: an innovation to help regular people. When peer-to-peer, or P2P, lending began in the middle of the last decade, it offered an easy way for people to lend money to each other over the Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On sites like Prosper Marketplace and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, prospective borrowers could list their requests, often alongside their personal stories, and people with spare cash could decide whether to finance them.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By cutting banks out of the process, borrowers typically got a lower interest rate than they would have paid on a credit card or a loan without collateral. And individual lenders earned higher returns -- averaging in the high single digits -- than they would have received by parking their money in a savings account or a certificate of deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That blend of altruism and yield attracted many individual investors, particularly in the wake of the financial crisis, when interest rates, and trust in banks, hit historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as the industry matures, a new class of investors is storming the P2P gates, and they include the very institutions that P2P had set out to bypass. Today, big financial firms, not small investors, dominate lending on the two platforms. At Prosper, which has been courting institutional lenders over the past year, more than 80 percent of the loans issued in March went to those firms. More than a dozen investment funds have been formed with the sole purpose of investing in peer-to-peer loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P2P sites are also attracting some of Wall Street's biggest names as board members and investors, and investment banks are vying to manage <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s hotly anticipated initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of institutional money has supercharged the sector, allowing Prosper and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and a host of newcomers to extend more loans to more borrowers. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> figures that it has saved borrowers $250 million in interest charges. The two platforms say they have made more than $5 billion in loans to date and have been doubling in growth every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investor demand is now outstripping the loan supply, spurring fierce competition among investors to snatch the best loans first. And the original P2P investors -- the dentists, dabblers and stay-at-home moms who helped establish the market -- are finding themselves outgunned by the cash-rich, algorithm-wielding arrivistes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P2P insiders say the new institutional investors benefit the industry. ''It will drive competition, drive down rates and allow us to serve customers better,'' says Alex Tonelli, a founder and managing director at Funding Circle, a San Francisco-based P2P market for small-business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Wall Street makeover -- some would say takeover -- of P2P lending is raising concerns as the new players begin securitizing loans and clamoring for more. Insiders predict a day when the loans are regularly sliced, diced and securitized, hedged, traded on secondary markets and tracked by exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, the big players' entry runs counter to the original notion of P2P lending as a populist alternative to the high stakes world of Wall Street. The term ''peer to peer'' has become something of a misnomer. Some of the latest lending platforms are ditching individual investors altogether to focus on big lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging the growing role of institutions, Ron Suber, the president of Prosper, says the industry as a whole is better described as ''online consumer finance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jeremiah Owyang, the founder of Crowd Companies, an organization that helps corporations navigate the so-called sharing economy to which P2P belongs, was more blunt. ''It won't be P2P for long,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Algorithmic Cherry-Picking</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Len Kendall, a digital-marketing executive in Chicago, was considering striking out on his own in 2012, he knew that he would have to live leaner. One place to cut back was his credit cards. Despite having an excellent credit score, over 700, he was paying 17 percent interest on about $10,000 in credit card debt. That was when he heard about Prosper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He applied for a loan and within days was approved for $10,000 to be paid back over three years at 7.5 percent interest. This loan was funded by dozens of small investors, who typically split investments over a large number of loans to diversify their risk. ''It was a pretty simple decision,'' Mr. Kendall says. ''Why should I pay more in interest than I have to?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper focus on prime and near-prime borrowers, that is, consumers with FICO scores higher than 640. The platforms apply their own credit models and assign borrowers to categories reflecting their level of risk. In the case of traditional loans, banks pocket the profit. On P2P sites, the individual lenders do. ''The difference is who's benefiting from it,'' says Renaud Laplanche, the founder and chief executive of Lending Club. Prosper and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> take a small origination fee from the borrower and 1 percent of interest payments to the lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sites' business model relies on scale: <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, the market leader, earned $7 million on revenue of $98 million in 2013, its first full year of profitability after seven years. That was on loan volume of $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fastest, and some say only, way to reach the kind of scale needed is to turn to institutions with boatloads of money to lend. Attracted by peer-to-peer's relatively high and predictable yields in a low-interest environment, big investors have jumped at the opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first in were hedge funds, like Eaglewood Capital Management and Arcadia Funds, which borrow money to amplify their returns and use their own algorithms to increase yields into the midteens or more. Soon, pension funds, asset managers, community banks and even sovereign wealth funds joined in. <span class="companylink">Santander Consumer USA</span>, the United States arm of the Spanish bank, has an agreement to buy up to 25 percent of <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, P2P loans that once took days or weeks to finance are snapped up in minutes, particularly those with higher yields. ''There is at least twice as much demand as there is supply today,'' says Matt Burton, the C.E.O. of Orchard, a firm that helps institutions invest in peer-to-peer loans. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper now set aside a randomly selected pool of loans for institutions, which prefer to swallow up whole loans rather than finance a piece of them. To eke out better returns, many fund managers then use their own credit algorithms to identify loans that may be underpriced or overpriced, and cherry-pick the ones they want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the <span class="companylink">Ranger Capital Group</span>, a Dallas-based investment group that raised a $15 million P2P fund last fall, deploys a proprietary algorithm it calls TruSight to exploit variances in credit models. ''Everyone's got their own secret sauce on how they evaluate loans,'' says Bill Kassul, a partner in the Ranger Specialty Income fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loans not taken by these sophisticated investors go back to a fractional lending pool that is open to both individual investors and institutions. That doesn't sit well with some. ''The institutional investors are snapping up all the worthwhile loans,'' one investor wrote on Prosper's blog, echoing many comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By cherry-picking, almost by definition what they leave behind is not as good,'' says Giles Andrews, founder and chief executive of Zopa, a British peer-to-peer lender that so far has dealt only with individual lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scrambling to Meet Demand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like high-frequency trading, P2P lending has become a game of speed. Much of the investing done by institutions these days is automated, and some hedge funds have installed computer servers close to <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper to gain an edge. ''The fastest computer right now is getting the most loans,'' says Peter Renton, the founder of Lend Academy, a site that follows the P2P market and co-hosts the annual LendIt conference, which runs through Tuesday in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosper and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> have created speed limits, known as governors, to counter these moves, and they have instituted purchase limits to ensure that big buyers don't hog all the loans. ''It's kind of an arms race,'' Mr. Kassul says. ''They put a governor on, but then everyone tries to trick the governor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper say they are trying to balance their lender mix among individuals, institutions and active fund managers. ''We want to be extremely careful and not let a handful of investors drive our expansion,'' Mr. Laplanche of <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Suber of Prosper says, ''We're making sure we stay true to our original business of P2P finance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, to meet demand, P2P executives are pushing into new, higher-yield markets. In March, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> expanded into small-business lending, an area where a wide range of online lenders already operate, and in April it acquired Springstone Financial, which lends money to students and people undergoing elective surgery. This $140 million deal was financed in part by a $65 million equity infusion by <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span>, BlackRock and other institutional funds, which valued <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> at nearly $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new loans will be part of <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s Policy 2 program, a catchall category for new, higher-risk loan types that is available, for now, only to big investors. Prosper, too, is expected to move into new areas of consumer loans. Mr. Laplanche and Mr. Suber say they have no plans to enter subprime lending, generally considered to be loans to people with credit scores below 620 or so. Other P2P sites, such as FreedomPlus, are targeting what they call ''emerging prime markets,'' consisting of people building credit or those with low FICO credit scores who are trying to build or rebuild their credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes worry some investors. ''They already have a problem keeping up with demand,'' says Ian Ippolito, an entrepreneur in Tampa, Fla., who invests on <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>. ''The question is, would they be tempted to lower their quality to attract more borrowers?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not an idle question. The first P2P loan portfolios have been securitized, ratings agencies are looking at the market, and insurance companies are considering products that would allow investors to hedge against loan defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dynamics taking shape -- high demand for riskier loan categories, hedge funds leveraging and securitizing their investments -- raise troublesome parallels to the mortgage crisis of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in the industry see little risk of a crisis, at least for now. At several billion dollars, the current P2P market is far too small to present any systemic risk, and P2P executives say lending has been handled responsibly. However, unlike a bank loan that requires collateral, the loans are unsecured. Also in contrast to a bank's typical practice, the P2P sites don't always verify a borrower's income. These factors result in higher risk and potential higher return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the peer-to-peer lending sites are regulated by the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, among other agencies. Because Prosper and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> work with individual investors, they are required to register each loan they offer to the public as a security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the event of another downturn, defaults would probably rise. But P2P executives say their underwriting is more transparent and their marketplace model more resilient than those of the banking system. ''You would have to have a catastrophic default,'' says Mr. Kassul at Ranger Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To assert some control, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper insist on approving leverage levels and securitization plans in their financial agreements with big lenders. ''We get all sorts of financial engineers come to us saying they want to create a derivative market, a credit default swap market,'' Mr. Suber says, ''and we say no, we are not participating in that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-Investor Stability</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter where the bulk of the money is coming from, marketers like to emphasize the human face of P2P lending. A direct-mail solicitation from <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> reads, ''Instead of paying interest to a credit card company or on a traditional bank loan, you get your loan through ordinary people like YOU who want to invest in YOUR success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the notion of P2P as a marketplace of individuals resonates with the public. On Zopa, which has underwritten more than 500 million pounds, or $840 million, in loans with only retail lenders, borrowers have reported feeling more responsibility to repay a loan when they know that another person has lent the money. The site's tiny default rate of less than 0.2 percent seems to back that up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're proof you can have a market of reasonable scale with just retail lenders,'' says Mr. Andrews, Zopa's chief executive. Lately, he has been approached by British institutions about investing on Zopa. ''We welcome that,'' he adds. ''The key is how to manage it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some start-ups, such as Lendvious, LendingRobot and Lend Academy, are creating tools to help small investors achieve better returns. And new platforms will arise that cater to retail investors, Mr. Renton at Lend Academy predicts. ''We'll see more niche sites emerge that say, 'Let's get back to the roots of this,' '' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small investors, it turns out, add much-needed stability to the market. Hedge funds and institutions tend to pull out of an asset class when another sector becomes more attractive. With retail investors, ''it's not just a handful of institutional investors behaving the same way at the same time,'' Mr. Laplanche says. ''It's tens of thousands of people making their own decisions.'' It was individual investors, after all, who stuck with Prosper and <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> as they grappled with regulatory and operational hurdles in the early days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stability and the cachet that small investors bring, the online consumer lenders will try hard to maintain a balance. But it's a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other sectors of the collaborative economy, where people directly rent out or lend assets such as cars, homes and skills to others, P2P lending originated in part as a way to take back some economic control from institutions that had lost public trust. So the shift to large institutions causes some to pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Scale can be a good thing,'' says Rachel Botsman, the founder of Collaborative Lab, a consulting firm. ''But do we come full circle, where the middleman is the same institution we were trying to get away from?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 11, 2014, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about peer-to-peer lending, which began as a way for individuals to lend money to each other online, misidentified a hedge fund that has entered the sector. It is Arcadia Funds, not Arcadia Capitol Advisors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstered by a successful crowdfunding campaign that raised $2.1 million -- with more than $1.6 million given by a broad cross-section of donors, activating a $500,000 matching gift -- the opera's board voted on Monday to rescind its decision to close.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year the company plans to mount a reduced season of three fully staged operas: Puccini's ''La Bohème,'' which was the troupe's first production in 1965, followed by Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and John Adams's ''Nixon in China.'' (A production of Wagner's ''Tannhäuser'' that had been planned for next year was canceled to save money.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Lazier, a board member who donated $1 million to find ways to keep the opera viable, and who was named president of the board this spring after more than a dozen other board members left, made the announcement of the opera company's return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The public spoke, we listened, and we're open for business,'' Ms. Lazier said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still potential hurdles ahead. The San Diego Opera needs to cut its budget to $10.5 million next season, down from more than $16 million in 2013. And it still must raise money and sell tickets. The company is about $2 million shy of its goal of raising $6.5 million from donors for next year, and it must take in $4 million from ticket sales and earned revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tickets for next year went on sale on Monday. The company increased the number of orchestra seats that would be available for $99 -- less than half what the most expensive orchestra seats cost -- and noted that the price of single tickets would start at $35.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers at the troupe have expressed a willingness to take a 10 percent pay cut, provided it is instituted across the company. Ian D. Campbell, the ensemble's former longtime general and artistic director, found his salary under scrutiny after he proposed the closing. Mr. Campbell, who parted ways with the company last week, said that he was ''very, very pleased'' that there would be a 50th season and that he wished the company success.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the roads not taken because students must take out loans for college? A collection of studies shows that the burden of student debt may well cause people to make different decisions than they would otherwise -- affecting not just individual lives but also the entire economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, it appears that people with student loans are less likely to start businesses of their own. A new study has found that areas with higher relative growth in student debt show lower growth in the formation of small businesses (in this case, firms with one to four employees).</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The correlation makes sense. People normally have only a certain amount of ''debt capacity,'' said Brent W. Ambrose, a professor of risk management at <span class="companylink">Pennsylvania State University</span> and a co-author of a preliminary paper on the research along with Larry Cordell and Shuwei Ma of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When students use up their debt capacity on student loans, they can't commit it elsewhere. ''Given the importance of an entrepreneur's personal debt capacity in financing a start-up business, student loan debt, which cannot be discharged via bankruptcy, can have lasting effects later in life and may impact the ability of future small-business owners to raise capital,'' the study says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering that 60 percent of jobs are created by small business, ''if you shut down the ability to create new businesses, you're going to harm the economy,'' Professor Ambrose said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student loan debt also appears to be affecting homeownership trends. According to research by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>, fewer 30-year-olds in general have bought homes since the recession, but the decline has been steeper for people with a history of student loan debt and has continued even as the housing market has recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total student loans outstanding have risen to $1.1 trillion, compared with $300 billion just a decade ago, according to the Fed's study. The average total debt for student borrowers was around $30,000 in 2013. No wonder borrowers have been reluctant to start businesses or to buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student loan debt may also affect career choices. Having a college loan appears to reduce the likelihood that people will choose a low-paying public-interest job, according to a 2011 study by Jesse Rothstein of the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, and Cecilia Elena Rouse of Princeton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They arrived at their conclusion by studying a well-off university that began meeting students' financial needs through a combination of work-study money and grants, and dispensing with loans altogether. (The school insisted on anonymity as a condition for participating in the study.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the new policy started in the early 2000s, students were more likely to choose well-paid professions like investment banking and consulting, Professor Rothstein said in an interview. After the policy took effect, more students chose jobs in areas like teaching and the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, the choices that student borrowers make are just common sense, based on the financial realities they face. Taken together, they seem to be having a substantive -- many would say negative -- effect on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is that enough reason for schools or the government to step in with a solution? Not many schools are like Anon U (as the researchers above called it), which could afford to take loans off the table. If society wants to change the skewing effect of student loans, some tough decisions about allocating educational resources may well lie ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">RRKidz</span> already offers Reading Rainbow in app form.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homes and schools have access to the web than tablets, Mr. Burton said. In addition to financing the web-based version, the crowdfunding money would subsidize its use in an as-yet-undetermined number of classrooms that have financial need.</p>

It is also being backed by several real estate firms and individuals including executives of <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, the owner and developer of the World Trade Center; Rising Realty Partners, a Los Angeles developer; the <span class="companylink">Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group</span>; Scott Plank, a real estate developer and former Under Armour executive; and Richard Boyle, former chief of Loopnet, an online commercial real estate listing service. The Collaborative Fund, an investment fund, also participated in the round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new money allows Fundrise to expand nationally and open the platform up to big developers. Over the past several months, almost 300 developers have signed on to the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor interest in real estate crowdfunding is growing. In the last few months, Realty Mogul announced a $9 million funding round from the venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Canaan Partners</span>, RealCrowd took in $1.6 million in seed funding from the Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz, Maverick Capital and others, and the North Carolina-based Groundfloor raised $300,000 from angel investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late April, the Carlton Group, a traditional real estate investment banking firm, also started a crowdfunding portal that will offer $1 billion worth of deals from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we started, no one had ever heard of real estate crowdfunding,'' said Ben Miller, 37. Three years later, ''the concept is well understood and we're now in a place where we can scale,'' added Daniel Miller, 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the real estate portals deal exclusively with accredited investors -- those deemed wealthy enough by regulators for risky investments. The Carlton Group, for example, aims for individual investments of $1 million to $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, Fundrise's mission from the start has been to let any resident of a community invest in real estate being developed there, even if they have just a few hundred dollars to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most commercial real estate projects are typically backed by private equity investors who are often far removed from the property. That distance, the Miller brothers say, frequently leads to a mismatch between what is built and the needs of the community. In addition, the chain of middlemen cut into investors' profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it awaits the final rules of the JOBS Act, Fundrise has to register each deal that includes small investors with securities regulators, a costly and time-consuming process. Fundrise's investors on the sites typically receive a share of the rental income from the property as well as a share of the proceeds (and any appreciation) when it is sold. Fundrise says its investors get average returns of 12 percent to 14 percent after fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the three dozen or so deals Fundrise has financed on its site, totaling $15 million and involving 1,000 investors, just three have been open to smaller investors so far, though more are in the works. But institutional capital will be a critical part of the mix, the brothers noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Renren</span>, which has also invested roughly $70 million in SoFi, a peer-to-peer lending site for the student loan market, sought out Fundrise this year after surveying the real estate crowdfunding field, according to Joseph Chen, the company's founder and chairman. ''The commonality here is community,'' said Mr. Chen, whose company, <span class="companylink">Renren</span>, means ''everyone'' in Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other investments came about after months of cultivating relationships with like-minded partners, such as Martin S. Burger, chief executive of Silverstein, and Tal Kerret, its chief investment officer, who said he was impressed with the brothers' vision and execution. ''I think they've cracked the code on how to do real estate crowdfunding well,'' said Mr. Kerret, who has also joined Fundrise's board.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Bennett, chief executive of Context Travel, was concerned that his 400 highly qualified tour guides -- including professors and architects -- were spending too much time on scheduling logistics. He wanted them focused instead on making customers happy, offering erudite tours in 24 countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the company introduced software it created to automate the scheduling process. Now, when an order for a tour comes into the company's website, a text is sent automatically to a guide asking if he or she can take the assignment. If the guide accepts, the system confirms it and reminders are sent out closer to the date. If the guide rejects the assignment, it is sent to another tour leader.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new system, Mr. Bennett said, keeps guides from ''getting bogged down in the mechanics of the assignment'' and ''also lets our sales people spend more time on the phone with customers answering questions, rather than emailing back and forth with staff on logistics.'' The software, which obviated the need for a $20,000-a-year employee and has led to increased sales around the world, cost just $5,000 to create.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 5.3 percent of American small businesses with at least one employee sell to customers overseas, according to the Office of International Trade, a division of the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>. The main barriers to exporting include a lack of information and the overall cost and time involved, according to a recent survey from the Small Business Export Association and the <span class="companylink">National Small Business Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, the U.S. market itself is pretty big,'' said Zev Siegl, a small business consultant in Seattle, ''so many companies don't feel the need to export.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of small companies exporting has been increasing, though, and the Obama administration recently announced a new program it says will streamline export reporting requirements, provide more information about foreign markets and make it easier to borrow money to finance foreign expansion. In the meantime, companies like Context Travel are using technology to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After brainstorming how to automate scheduling with a friend who created a prototype program, Mr. Bennett handed the project to his own developers. The team wrote the software in about two weeks to work with <span class="companylink">Twilio</span>, which provides the ability to send and receive phone calls and text messages from within a software program. ''We tried this years ago before the advent of <span class="companylink">Twilio</span> and other services, and it didn't work,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies manage to find off-the-shelf technology that helps them increase international sales. One example is Andrew Short's one-person company in Bellevue, Wash., Jungle Education, which creates educational apps for the iPad that help children learn basics like telling time, simple fractions, coin math and geometry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Short wanted to expand and considered creating a new English-language app, which he expected to take four months. On the other hand, he reasoned, it might take only two weeks to adapt an existing app for a foreign-language market using translation services. To do so, Mr. Short would have to translate both the words that appear on the screen and those spoken aloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To translate the screen text, Mr. Short chose ICanLocalize, which connects him with freelance translators abroad. He posts his job, and reads the résumés and reviews of interested providers. He hires one and sends his text. Generally paying 9 cents a word, Mr. Short ends up spending less than $100 to translate a typical version of a children's app.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the spoken word, Mr. Short used to work with local foreign-language speakers, volunteers to whom he gave gift certificates. It worked, but the process required recruiting talent and spending hours in recording sessions and editing. ''It was tedious and time-consuming,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researching on the web, Mr. Short discovered a text-to-speech service, Acapelabox, which lets users type words or sentences and then listen to the way they sound when spoken by a variety of voices: male, female, happy, sad, young and in various languages. The speed of speech, the tone and the pronunciation of words can be modified with controls on the website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Short now uses Acapelabox to create sound files that he can use royalty-free in his app. ''The computer-generated voices aren't quite as good as humans, but they are close,'' he said, ''and they are easier to work with than humans.'' Because each app has only about 500 words to translate, the cost is around $15 per app.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Short started with German and French versions of his products, assuming that countries with large populations would generate the most sales. Because the translations were so inexpensive, however, he commissioned additional languages. In all, he spent $405 on Acapelabox for 27 translated versions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those versions, he said, increased his sales last year to $175,000 from $120,000. And it turned out that Dutch and Swedish were his most popular foreign versions, selling 20,000 copies for Dutch and 12,000 copies in Swedish. ''If I hadn't had the opportunity to do all those translations so economically,'' he said, ''I wouldn't have found my largest foreign markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applerouth Tutoring Services, a 13-year-old company in Atlanta, initially offered its services only in the United States. But the number of foreign students applying to American colleges and looking for help with entrance exams like the SAT is increasing, said Natalie Henderson, Applerouth's chief operating officer. ''They were finding us on the Internet,'' she said, ''and we wanted an effective way to work with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as a new company, Applerouth wanted to focus time and resources on tutoring rather than on physically expanding its footprint. ''Rent alone for a single office space can range anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 a month,'' Ms. Henderson said. ''Tack on the costs of recruiting, hiring, training and managing tutors in an area, and it would easily be cost prohibitive for us to operate in almost any of the overseas markets in which we currently do business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applerouth has not advertised for business overseas, but it did not want to turn away the foreign students who found it through online searches or referrals. As an alternative, the company wanted to start offering online tutoring sessions through virtual meeting software products like Skype, Join.Me, Fuze or Zoom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, it picked two products geared to education, WebEx and WizIQ. The products are similar, but Applerouth uses both in case one goes down. They cost a combined $6,000 a year, based on Applerouth's current student load, and offer the company's tutors and students the ability to see and talk to each other as they review test questions and concepts on a shared virtual whiteboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology, Ms. Henderson said, ''allows us to pre-open new markets so we can save resources until we know an area is large enough to justify a physical presence.'' It also lets Applerouth match tutors and students according to their academic needs and personalities, Ms. Henderson said, rather than placing the students with the one or two tutors they might be able to hire in a city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the most common technology tools can prove valuable to a small business that wants to operate overseas. Frederick Fine created software for his 15-person company, SmartFolks, that delivers short quizzes to hotel employees' phones or other devices, as a way to train them without pulling them off their jobs and into a classroom. The software is cloud-based and uses responsive web design to automatically display properly on any device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Fine spent $463 to identify 163,000 people with the title ''hotel general manager'' on LinkedIn and placed an ad for his training software on their profile pages with a link to a demonstration copy of the product. More than 200 prospects clicked on the link. ''We'd have to pay a marketing firm $5,000 to $10,000 just to establish a beginning marketing campaign,'' he said, let alone to find interested prospects. The company is now working with 18 major hotel brands, including Marriott. The new technologies and services, Mr. Fine said, ''really let a small company get into the game and compete.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two businessmen have watched art galleries and luxury condominiums pop up and throngs of tourists pour onto the High Line. Everywhere, there is new money, new affluence and new faces. And as rents soar, many old-timers are vanishing and familiar storefronts are going dark.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past six months, the florist has closed. The butcher has closed. The Italian cafe has closed. Shuttered stores now anchor both ends of their block between 20th and 21st Streets, and the two men sometimes wonder: Will we survive as small-business owners in Chelsea?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is they won't go without a fight. They are repositioning themselves, adjusting to the evolving economic landscape and praying that there is still some room in Manhattan for the little guy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kraus, who has owned the Barking Zoo pet supply store for 14 years, focuses on locally sourced, organic pet food, high-end pet accessories and ''I Love Chelsea'' dog sweaters and souvenirs for the tourists. He prides himself on knowing his customers (and their pets) by name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Singh has owned the Dil-E Punjab Deli for 20 years and caters primarily to taxi drivers, promoting his $6.99 lunch and dinner buffet with signs and a sidewalk placard designed to appeal to wealthier taste buds. (''Vegan Indian Food,'' the signs proclaim. ''Pure Vegetarian.'') He delivers fliers to the new condos and high-rent apartments and sells bottles of chilled San Pellegrino along with mango juice and Indian spices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results? Mr. Kraus, 52, who considered closing his business a few years ago, is feeling optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thankfully, we've seen a moderate increase in sales this year, which is what we need to continue,'' he said. ''As long as we understand what our customers really want from us, we'll be fine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Singh, who works next door to Mr. Kraus, is more uncertain. Customers from the neighborhood are coming in ''more and more,'' he said. But he lost 40 percent of his business when the city created bike lanes along Ninth Avenue, making it impossible for taxis to park in front of his store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His lease will be up in about two years, and he wonders whether he can survive another rent increase. ''If I can get some break in rent, I'd like to stay here,'' said Mr. Singh, 65, who wants the city to put a taxi stand nearby. ''I can only trust in God.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised to refocus the city's attention on entrepreneurs like Mr. Singh and Mr. Kraus. He has vowed to stem the flow of subsidies and tax breaks to big corporations and to address the needs of small businesses, arguing that they were neglected by his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the de Blasio administration announced a new program to identify strategies to help immigrants start and expand businesses. City officials plan to reduce fines and to make it easier for small firms to bid on city contracts. And they have unveiled a new fund that will offer financing to small businesses working on public or private construction projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, though, none of these efforts appear likely to help business owners like Mr. Singh and Mr. Kraus, who may ultimately be priced out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chelsea, the changes are plain to see: Between 2000 and 2012, the median value of owner-occupied properties increased to $817,459 from $361,371, while the number of poorer, less educated residents in the neighborhood declined, according to aggregated census data analyzed by Susan Weber-Stoger, a demographer at Queens College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kraus and Mr. Singh witnessed the transformation when part of a seminary across the street from their stores was sold to a developer. A luxury condominium replaced it, with a penthouse apartment currently listed at $16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The men feel the pinch: When Mr. Kraus renewed his lease this year, his rent rose to $6,500 a month, up from $5,000. Mr. Singh pays a similar amount. Mr. Kraus has four employees at the pet store and Mr. Singh has three at his deli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was no surprise to them to hear that Alan Sklar, the owner of Alan's Alley Video, will be shutting his doors after nearly 26 years in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is starting to feel homogenized,'' said Katy Eppley, an interior decorator who stopped in the Barking Zoo last week. ''The neighborhood is losing its beautiful, creative vibe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kraus, who rented an apartment in Chelsea for two decades, is already gone. Two years ago, he moved to Harlem. ''All my people have left Chelsea,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he and Mr. Singh, who lives in Queens, plan to hang on as businessmen. They hope to keep their foothold in the neighborhood, even if they cannot say for how long.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With less than three weeks to go until the Democratic primary for Representative Charles B. Rangel's seat in <span class="companylink">Congress</span>, he and his top rival, State Senator Adriano Espaillat, courted voters on Wednesday by promising to bring sorely needed jobs to the struggling Harlem and Bronx neighborhoods that make up much of their district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Mr. Rangel hosted a job fair and Mr. Espaillat called for enhanced tax incentives to help small businesses pay decent wages, the overriding theme of their contest -- whether Mr. Rangel's longevity should be seen as an asset or a weakness -- never quite faded into the background.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside a gym at Roberto Clemente State Park in the Bronx, Mr. Rangel, 83, commended job seekers for showing up to look for work. ''You're very, very special people because you did not wait for the job to come to you,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he added a message of encouragement, one that could have doubled as a motto in his fight for a 23rd term: ''The most important lesson is that you can't give up, you can't give out, and you can't give in,'' Mr. Rangel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In East Harlem, meanwhile, Mr. Espaillat, 59, took to a street corner outside the sprawling East River Plaza -- a thriving shopping complex, with <span class="companylink">Costco</span> and Target stores -- to attack it as a monument to an outdated economic development strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project had received a $15 million loan and $40 million in bonds through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone program created under legislation Mr. Rangel sponsored 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big-box store subsidy model perpetuates a cycle of poverty,'' Mr. Espaillat said, adding that many workers earn only the minimum wage and never climb above the poverty level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's not the way to lift the community from a serious recession,'' he added. ''This is a model that I think belongs to the past, and we want to talk about a model for the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake in the race between Mr. Rangel and Mr. Espaillat -- a rematch of a 2012 contest that Mr. Espaillat narrowly lost -- is the future of the 13th Congressional District, whose demographics have shifted to predominantly Hispanic from predominantly black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rangel, a founder of the <span class="companylink">Congressional Black Caucus</span>, who lost his leadership post on <span class="companylink">the House</span> Ways and Means Committee in an ethics scandal, is trying to make inroads with Latino constituents like the many Dominican-Americans who have moved to the area since he entered <span class="companylink">the House</span> in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Espaillat, who was born in the Dominican Republic, is working to energize his base to counteract what polls show is Mr. Rangel's advantage with older voters, who often come out to vote in disproportionately high numbers in primaries like the one on June 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pastor of a large Harlem church, the Rev. Michael A. Walrond Jr., and a Bronx activist, Yolanda Garcia, are also in the race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a half-dozen East Harlem small business owners, Mr. Espaillat outlined how he wanted to change the Empowerment Zone program: A tax incentive that now awards businesses with $3,000 per employee would be doubled to $6,000 per employee for small businesses. Large companies would get $2,000 per worker, if they pay employees a so-called living wage and benefits. (Large companies that do not would receive no tax incentives, under his plan.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Espaillat said big-box retailers had displaced small businesses and paid such low wages that workers earned as little as $15,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By his side was Pedro Matar, president of El Barrio Mexican Chamber of Commerce and a co-owner of El Aguila, a restaurant with locations in East Harlem and Passaic, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked how much he paid his employees, Mr. Matar paused, then said $8.25 an hour -- the minimum wage in New Jersey and a quarter more than the minimum wage in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hearing this, Mr. Espaillat interjected: ''So if I give Pedro a $6,000 tax credit, you know, he may hire somebody at $10 an hour. He can hire a veteran.'' At his job fair, Mr. Rangel was mobbed by résumé-carrying constituents who asked to have their photos taken with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been to three of his job fairs with his name attached to them,'' said Dorothy Hendricks, 49, who lives in the Bronx. ''I got three interviews.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hendricks said her job hunt had been difficult. ''When you look at the applications today, they say you must be bilingual,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rangel is not bilingual, but he was ready when Fior Frias, 51, a home health aide, posed for a picture with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody from the Dominican Republic loves you,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gracias,'' Mr. Rangel said, kissing her hand.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDI first heard about the JuiceTank, a slim iPhone case that doubles as a wall charger, when my friends started raving about it two years ago on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. There was one catch, though it didn't bother them: The JuiceTank didn't yet exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the brainchild of two guys at a start-up company who were seeking money via Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site. My curiosity was piqued, too, so I paid $55 in March 2012 to help bring the gadget into the world. My money was a ''pre-order,'' and my own JuiceTank was slated for delivery a few months later.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while, I eagerly awaited the arrival of my spiffy new charger, but as time passed -- a lot of time -- I managed to do without it. Then, a few months ago, I became determined to find out what had happened to my order and to my money. So I sent a polite email to the support team, which replied that my JuiceTank had actually been delivered some months earlier, but to an old address. The team offered to send a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had another idea, though: I identified myself as a reporter and asked to be put in touch with the creators of the JuiceTank, so I could learn what had gone awry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later, I was shaking hands with Lloyd Gladstone and Jesse Pliner, the pair behind the product, in their offices in downtown Manhattan. Both were eager to walk me through the series of errors and glitches that they encountered as they began to transform their idea into a business two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything that could go wrong went wrong,'' said Mr. Gladstone, including their choice of the name, JuiceTank, which another company was already using.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, they changed their product's name to the Prong -- but the nomenclature snag was only a taste of the hassles ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designing and fabricating a basic prototype was much harder than they had expected, and they spoke wearily of the process of obtaining permission from <span class="companylink">Apple</span> to sell the case as a licensed accessory. They were required to work with a small number of preapproved factories, so the men traveled to and from China to negotiate a manufacturing deal and to oversee production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Mr. Pliner, who worked in finance, and Mr. Gladstone, who was studying to become a lawyer, were truly just starting up: They had no prior experience with products or manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were learning everything on the fly,'' Mr. Pliner said. They kept pushing back the date for shipping, leaving their customers -- like me -- waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We kept making promises and failing to deliver,'' Mr. Gladstone said. ''There was a point where people started to wonder if it was a scam.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they had raised $130,000 through Kickstarter, they burned through the sum rather quickly. It wasn't enough to finance their early costs, so they raised additional money privately. Finally, they began shipping iPhone cases in December 2013 -- nearly a year after they had originally promised to deliver them -- and immediately hit another speed bump: Their case no longer seemed cutting-edge. By then, sleek and inexpensive cases that doubled as battery chargers from companies like Mophie and Lenmar were flooding the market. ''The technology caught up with what we were offering,'' Mr. Gladstone said. They needed to develop a second-generation version of their product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are now doing so -- with the PWR Case, which offers a detachable backup battery. And this time around, the company has the benefit of experience: It now has 15 employees, and has already sold thousands of the original product. Its creators are using capital they have already raised, and say they have a deal with <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> to distribute their updated cases, which, they say, will go on sale this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While they made plenty of mistakes, they say they were lucky to have begun with Kickstarter, which generated interest and funding for a project that might not have survived otherwise. Kickstarter, they said, gave them a much-needed stamp of credibility and a core audience, which they plan to leverage for future products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been real success stories on Kickstarter, and I've enjoyed watching some of them take off: products like the Pebble smartwatch, the party game Cards Against Humanity and the virtual-reality headset called the Oculus Rift. (<span class="companylink">Facebook</span> announced in March that it was buying the company that makes the headset, for $2 billion.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the buzz emanating from Kickstarter that led me to help fund the JuiceTank in the first place. The idea of helping two ambitious inventors experiment with a product appealed to me, as did the thought that I would own a funky new case that few people had.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet all those months of waiting cooled some of my initial excitement about crowdfunding on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, a similar site. I used to peruse them relentlessly, looking for neat projects like photography books, indie magazines and movies that I could put a few dollars toward. But I have not pledged money in any crowdfunding campaigns since late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the help from Kickstarter, Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Pliner said they weren't likely to use it or any other crowdfunding site to raise money in the future. One reason is that they no longer need to go that route; Now that they're experienced, they said, they should be able to attract more capital through direct investment if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A problem with Kickstarter projects a couple of years ago, they said, was that people who backed them might not have understood that they might be funding ideas that hadn't yet been developed or manufactured. In 2012 Kickstarter began to require that hardware projects on the site show prototypes to reduce the chance of two-year delivery lags like the one I experienced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Kickstarter and other sites, like Indiegogo, view themselves as project enablers, not as guarantors. They say they aren't responsible if a project doesn't deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't force anyone to do anything,'' said Slava Rubin, one of the founders and the C.E.O. of Indiegogo. ''If someone wants to fund something, they should make an informed decision before doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my case, I believe that I did that. In the end, I've got an extra iPhone charging case, and despite the long delay, seeing a company get started was interesting. For me, it was the process, not the product, that counted most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 22, 2014, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Bits column last Sunday, about a start-up company's hurdles in developing a combination phone case and charger, referred incorrectly to a policy change made by Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site that was used by the company. The change required that hardware projects funded on the site show a prototype, not necessarily a finished product. The column also misstated the year of the policy change. It was 2012, not 2013.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HALF MOON BAY, Calif. -- The Pacific Ocean glistens in the distance, past the rolling bluffs that rise beyond the electric gate that blocks off Martin's Beach Road. The road leads to Martin's Beach, once a revered hideaway for surfers, fishers and beachgoers drawn by its isolation, dramatic cliffs and sweep of soft sand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, the future of this hidden beach on the San Francisco Peninsula is being fought in a courthouse 25 miles away, in a battle that has become the latest class-charged standoff involving a wealthy entrepreneur in this polarized part of California. Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, paid $37.5 million in 2008 for a 53-acre parcel of ocean land that includes the beach and the road -- and proceeded to close the gate, posting armed guards and signaling that he was prepared to spend what it takes to keep the public off what he contends is private land.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are saying, 'Talk about entitlement: Rich people think they can get away with anything,' '' said Rob Caughlan, the former president of the Surfrider Foundation, the nonprofit organization that brought the suit. ''All we want is to get Khosla to follow the same law as everyone else does.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khosla, who is best known as a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, declined a request for an interview. One of his lawyers, Jeffrey Essner, said the have-and-have-not argument had hijacked, at least in public perception, what he described as a cut-and-dried case about private property rights. ''It's being sensationalized in the media to focus on populist sentiments and the 1 percent,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California is a state with many beautiful beaches and almost as many millionaires who want their own beachfront homes, and this is hardly the first fight to be fought over an ocean view. But by every measure, this one has taken on added resonance, taking place against the backdrop of tensions in San Francisco caused by the influx of high-paid Silicon Valley executives and embodied by the <span class="companylink">Google</span> buses that take them to work each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit being fought at the San Mateo County Courthouse -- a decision is expected in the summer -- signals the latest stage in a five-year flurry of litigation, protests, civil disobedience, indignation and arrests, aimed at forcing Mr. Khosla, who does not live on the property, to let people back on the beach (which is variously called Martin's Beach and Martins Beach). His opponents contend he is defying the State Constitution, state law and the mind-set of ''the beach belongs to everyone'' that is fundamental to many Californians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compelled by a judge to testify, Mr. Khosla said on the stand: ''If you're asking me why any gate is locked, it's to restrict public access. That's a general statement about gates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the previous owner of Martin's Beach gave people access to the beach for a fee, Mr. Khosla has put up a forbidding gate, albeit a low one that can be sidestepped. While a few surfers and bathers do trespass and use the beach, some have been arrested, the surfers say, though fewer recently as the dispute has heated up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight has moved to Sacramento as well. Last month, the California Senate approved a bill that would permit the state to use the power of eminent domain to seize enough land to provide a public passageway to the beach. Next, the bill will be considered by the <span class="companylink">Assembly</span>, where it faces an uncertain future. ''The coast is protected, and when somebody does something that's going to affect that, there's going to be a reaction -- and a strong one,'' said the sponsor of the bill, Jerry Hill, a Democratic state senator from San Mateo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier court challenge to Mr. Khosla failed when a San Mateo judge ruled that the Constitution, which declares that all property below the mean tide line is public, and a 1976 law mandating that property owners provide access to these beaches were superseded by the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The treaty ended the Mexican-American War by requiring that the United States recognize Mexican land grants, including one that awarded rights to this plot well before the Constitution was adopted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest case is in some ways more narrow: The Surfrider Foundation contends that under the Coastal Act of 1976, Mr. Khosla was required to obtain a permit from the <span class="companylink">California Coastal Commission</span> before he blocked access to the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not a rocket-science case,'' said Joe Cotchett, the lawyer representing the Surfrider Foundation. ''This is a case all about arrogance. This is a case where a multibillionaire -- not a millionaire, a billionaire -- has just decided to build a castle on that beach, and the public is going to be barred.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khosla said at the trial that he did not have a plan in mind for the property. Dori L. Yob, another of his lawyers, called the case ''a property right issue just like any other -- just like you or I would want to protect our private property rights.'' She added, ''Just because where your house sits used to be a public beach doesn't mean people can walk through your backyard while you are having breakfast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presumption of opening the beach is powerful in California. About six miles up the road from the beach, the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>, a lush complex of golf courses and high-end living overlooking the Pacific, provides free ''coastal access'' parking and a marked trail leading to the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down south in Malibu, outside Los Angeles, beach advocates fought successfully with David Geffen, the billionaire who owns a home on Broad Beach, to force him to open a gate leading down to the ocean. Jenny Price, one of the leaders of that coastal access battle, said, ''It's tricky, because I realize this is private property, but the Constitution requires that the public have access to the public beach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A walk down Martin's Beach Road reveals about 40 or more weathered beach shacks nestled around the water, most of them leased through 2021, with names like Cozy Cabin and Casa Blanca. On a recent morning, there was not a person in sight on the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a gem; it's beyond compare,'' said Pete McCloskey, a Republican former member of <span class="companylink">Congress</span> who represented the area and is involved in the court battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. McCloskey and others said they assumed that Mr. Khosla had bought the land intending to bulldoze the cottages and build something newer and grander, he testified that was not necessarily so. ''I bought the beach, but I had no plan for the beach,'' Mr. Khosla said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some, Mr. Khosla's actions seem particularly surprising because he has been closely identified with advocating green technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought Khosla was going to be a good guy,'' said Mr. Caughlan of the Surfrider Foundation, who once posed with Mr. Khosla for a photograph in an environment issue of <span class="companylink">Vanity Fair</span> with a group of men on the California coastline. ''When he bought Martin's Beach, I thought, 'Oh great, an environmentalist bought that beach.' And then he cut off access to everyone and we went, 'What? Where did that come from?' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no question that the term ''redskin'' has been used as a racial slur for American Indians for hundreds of years and is on par with offensive terms used to denigrate blacks and Hispanics. And it is also clear that federal law prohibits the <span class="companylink">Patent and Trademark Office</span> from registering trademarks that disparage people or bring them ''into contempt, or disrepute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was right in ruling on Wednesday that six trademarks granted to the owners of the <span class="companylink">Washington Redskins</span> football team should be canceled because the name is disparaging to many American Indians.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2-to-1 ruling has no immediate effect on the team, which says it will appeal the decision. That would be a mistake. The team's owner, Daniel Snyder, should reconsider his obstinate refusal to change the name, which he has preposterously argued was a ''badge of honor'' for American Indians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appeal board, part of the <span class="companylink">United States Patent and Trademark Office</span>, was swayed by evidence that the <span class="companylink">National Congress of American Indians</span> had objected to and tried to get the team to change its name since the 1960s, before registrations for the six trademarks were renewed. The board also found that there was a ''near complete drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s.'' And starting in 1966, American dictionaries consulted by an expert witness hired by the team's owner began labeling the term as offensive; by 1986 all dictionaries did so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Snyder and his lawyers are confident that they can have the board's ruling overturned. The appeal board issued a similar ruling against the team in 1999, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ultimately threw out that decision on the grounds that the plaintiffs in that case had waited too long past the age of majority to file their case; the <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span> declined to review that decision in 2009. But the appeals court never ruled on the issue of whether the trademarks were disparaging. That's why this current case, which involves younger plaintiffs, might have a better shot at succeeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the appeal, the Washington team's trademarks will continue to be protected under federal law. But if the team ultimately loses, other businesses will be free to produce and sell merchandise bearing the team's name and logos. The team could still try to enforce its trademarks by invoking its common law rights, but that could be a difficult legal process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little anybody can do legally to force Mr. Snyder and <span class="companylink">National Football League</span> to change the team name. But they should realize that even if they successfully challenge the trademark board's decision, using a term that so clearly offends so many people undermines the value of the team and the league.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can't make this up. The Guardian reported on Sunday that Ukrainians have crowdfunded the first ''people's drone'' to help their army stem infiltration by Russian-supported rebels in Ukraine's eastern provinces that border Russia. ''Last week, Ukraine's crowdfunding site 'The People's Project' said that it had received enough donations to fund a drone,'' The Guardian reported. ''The organizers had originally hoped to buy a state-of-the-art Israeli drone -- for $165,000 -- or a cheaper American one costing $120,000. In the end, however, they managed to build the drone for just $35,000. A designer and other volunteers built the airframe, with a Ukrainian military institute chipping in technical equipment.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good for them. The fate of Ukraine matters -- as much, if not more, as Syria and Iraq. We don't have to search for ''moderates'' in Ukraine. Millions there have already both fought for and voted to align their country with the free markets and free people of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brussels, on Friday, the newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, signed a trade pact with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> that will lower tariffs on Ukrainian exports to the 28-nation E.U. market in return for Ukraine implementing anti-corruption, transparency and quality-control reforms designed to bring its economy up to Western standards. It was the same deal that Poroshenko's predecessor, Viktor Yanukovych, refused to sign last November under pressure from President Vladimir Putin of Russia. That set off the revolution in Kiev's main square that eventually toppled Yanukovych and ignited a rebellion by Putin-directed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Which is why only hours after the deal was signed, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, was quoted by the <span class="companylink">Interfax</span> news agency as ominously warning that the E.U.-Ukraine accord would have ''serious consequences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Really? Think about that. One nation threatening another for signing a trade pact in hopes of elevating the incomes of its people, which have badly lagged those of its neighbors, like Poland, who joined the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I get that the Russians would not want Ukraine to join <span class="companylink">NATO</span>, a defense alliance still aimed at containing Russian power. I opposed <span class="companylink">NATO</span>'s expansion at the end of the Cold War and would not support it now. But a trade deal that doesn't even lead to automatic E.U. membership? Is this how Russia maintains its power status? By keeping its neighbors poor and energy starved?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had argued in May that Putin had ''blinked'' when, in the wake of Western sanctions and the threat of more, he pulled back troops from Ukraine's border where he had massed them -- hoping first to block Poroshenko's election and then the signing of the E.U. deal. But maybe Putin just winked. While he did not invade, he has shoveled arms and proxies into eastern Ukraine to foment separatism in Russian-speaking areas. Today, Poroshenko -- fed up with Putin's Goebbels-quality lying -- moved forces to regain control of eastern Ukraine and his country's right to choose its future. Putin is clearly afraid of more sanctions. It is time the U.S. and E.U. imposed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In denying Ukrainians the right to choose their own economic and political path, Putin shows how dumb and clever he is at the same time. He is dumb in believing that, in this connected world of newly empowered citizens, he can enjoy the same ''sphere of influence'' that Russia had in Central Europe in the days of the czars. Sorry. If a leader wants to have a sphere of influence today -- in this age of ''people of influence'' -- he either has to earn it by how he behaves or take it all by force. In Ukraine, Putin is in incapable of the former and -- for now -- doesn't dare do the latter. The czars never had to deal with people of influence who could crowdfund their own drone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Putin is also clever. Or as the Russian analyst Vladimir Frolov put it in The Moscow Times: ''President Vladimir Putin may fail to secure his goal of derailing Ukraine's association agreement with the E.U., but at home he has already cashed in on his Ukrainian political strategy by completely resetting Russia's national conversation. His principal achievement has been to eliminate any meaningful debate on alternative futures for Russia. Less than a year ago, there was still political space to advance democratic alternatives to Putin's system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the Russian seizure of Crimea and its proxy war in Ukraine, added Frolov, ''transformed the national conversation from a healthy debate on Putin's presidential performance into a toxic discussion on war and Russia's enemies. Moscow's propaganda has successfully painted Ukraine's popular uprising against state capture by a corrupt clique as a 'U.S.-sponsored fascist coup.' '' Therefore, if Putin ''is fighting Nazis in Ukraine, then by extension anyone who disagrees with him could be a Nazi collaborator and an enemy of Russia. This closes the political space for all alternative visions for Russia except as a revisionist empire hostile to the West.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: In my June 25 column about Arab governing models, I misinterpreted ''takfiris.'' They are Muslim extremists who declare others to be apostates.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- This might be the latest twist on crowdfunding -- or the web equivalent of seeking a ransom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span>, a purveyor of file-sharing technology that is widely used to gain free access to music and films, has come up with a bold proposition for its tens of millions of daily users: Spend $9.95 to help finance a planned new science fiction series and gain viewing rights to its eight episodes. Or fail to pay up, and the shows will never be made.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospective series, called ''Children of the Machine,'' is expected to be announced on Monday as part of <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span>'s latest and perhaps most daring attempt to make paying customers of an estimated 170 million worldwide users. While the site itself eschews piracy, many people employ its open-source file-sharing technology to download music, films and television shows, whether legally or illegally, without charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marco Weber, a seasoned independent film executive, is to produce the new series, based on a pilot written jointly by him and Jeff Stockwell, whose credits include the movie fantasy ''Bridge to Terabithia.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes according to plan, Mr. Weber will distribute the pilot -- which he would finance himself with help from private investors -- free on <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> in December, while offering to make the full series if approximately 250,000 users pay the asking price. ''I think of it as the perfect hybrid between Kickstarter and <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>,'' said Mr. Weber, who spoke last week of an effort that merges crowdfunding techniques with a potentially powerful distribution platform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the pilot makes its debut, the next steps should move quickly, Mr. Weber added. Or else they won't move quickly enough. ''In four to six weeks, I'll know if it works or if it doesn't,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weber has directed or produced youth-oriented independent films including ''The Informers,'' based on a Bret Easton Ellis book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> will precede Mr. Weber's foray by inserting a paywall -- something it has been avoiding -- in one of its so-called bundles. These are downloads that for the last year have been used by musicians, graphic novel publishers and others to offer their work or promotional material in return for nothing more costly than a user's email address. The new paywall will permit access to a music bundle from what the company says will be a major artist, still to be named.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We saw the opportunity to build what we think will become the leading place for independent content creation,'' Matt Mason, the chief content officer for <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span>, said of the new fee-based initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mason, who has made the point before, once again stressed that his site circulates sharing technology but does not condone piracy. ''People wrongly assume we're about illegal file-sharing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> has failed in the past to make entertainment buyers of those who use its wares to share content. In 2008, the company shut down a short-lived operation, called <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> Entertainment Network, that had joined Hollywood companies in offering a menu of movie and television downloads for a price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mason, who joined <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> after that venture failed, said he believed it had charged too much -- an episode of ''Desperate Housewives'' cost as much as $20, he noted. At the same time, he said, the undertaking did little to accommodate the habits of <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> visitors, who tend to be male, young and inclined to drill deeply into whatever interests them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with the peer-to-peer spirit of that audience, <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> in the last year has made available about 10,000 bundles, each of which is controlled not by the company but by an independent artist or other purveyor. So far, free bundles have been downloaded 100 million times, even though many of them require providing an email address -- no small act of trust by some wary <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the paywall option is in place for bundles, the artist will charge a fee, not <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span>. The site, as the host and distributor, will take a cut -- adding a revenue stream, and perhaps genuine growth potential, if Mr. Weber, the still unnamed musician or musicians, or others can deliver a hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mason said <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span>, which is owned by its founder, Bram Cohen, and others, including the venture capital firms <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span> and DCM, has been profitable since 2008, but he declined to discuss its finances otherwise. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has about 115 employees, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> currently makes money by, for instance, charging users for enhanced software services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of the company's programming effort was cautiously welcomed by some in Hollywood, where <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> is often still viewed as a pirate's adjunct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all want to see new business models that reach audiences who are willing to reward creativity by paying a fair price,'' said Ruth Vitale, executive director of CreativeFuture, an antipiracy coalition that includes both artists and companies. But Ms. Vitale is among those who want to see <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> executives take a stronger stance against abuse of their technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they are sincere about supporting creatives,'' she said, ''<span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> needs to condemn the widespread misuse of the protocol it created'' by those who pirate the work of artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weber, who spoke in a poolside interview at the Viceroy hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., said he had been introduced to <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> by executives at Cinedigm, a digital entertainment company for which he is under contract to produce lower-budget genre films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cinedigm, Mr. Weber said, is expected at some point to join in promoting and distributing ''Children of the Machine'' through its new ConTV channel, a web-based subscription venture with Wizard World, the company that produces the Comic Con fan conventions (which are independent of San Diego's annual <span class="companylink">Comic-Con International</span>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one-hour pilot for ''Children of the Machine,'' which Mr. Weber will direct, should cost slightly under $1 million to make, he said. His Rapid Eye Studios retains rights to the show and, at least in theory, could sell episodes to a conventional television network if the series were to do well on <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story line, about teenagers in a near-future America ravaged by global warming and gripped by the rebellion of its own increasingly intelligent technology, is specifically tailored to young, technologically knowledgeable <span class="companylink">BitTorrent</span> users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It even includes the occasional reference to those cascades of data that give the site its name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We used the torrents,'' Mr. Weber said. ''We integrated some of their software in our plot.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jake Fitzsimmons opened his first Stuft Burger Bar in Fort Collins, Colo., in 2010, after the worst recession in decades. It turned out to be an excellent time to open a burger joint -- Coloradans were downsizing their dinners out -- but a terrible time to apply for a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why even bother?'' Mr. Fitzsimmons remembers thinking.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he used his own savings and borrowed money from his father. In 2012, Mr. Fitzsimmons and his partner, Tiffany Helton, did it again, opening a second restaurant without bank help. Last fall, however, they tried a different approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fitzsimmons and Ms. Helton were preparing to open a third location in Greeley, about 30 miles from Fort Collins. Given Stuft's success and the improving economy, their adviser, Richard Pickett, executive director of the East Colorado Small Business Development Center, offered an alternative to going to each bank ''hat in hand,'' as Mr. Fitzsimmons put it, to request a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why don't you have them bid on it?'' Mr. Pickett suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the pair hosted three banks -- <span class="companylink">Bank of Colorado</span>, <span class="companylink">First National Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> -- at Mr. Pickett's office one day in early September. In back-to-back, hourlong meetings, they made their case for a $500,000 loan. A week later, Mr. Fitzsimmons also met with a loan officer from the bank that held his business accounts, <span class="companylink">Home State Bank</span>. Because the banks knew that the pair were talking to other banks, Mr. Fitzsimmons said, ''Our hope with that was that they would give us their best offer originally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a couple of weeks, three of the lenders had returned preliminary proposals. <span class="companylink">Bank of Colorado</span> and <span class="companylink">First National</span> offered nearly identical terms for a loan that split the risk with the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span>, including a 5.25 percent interest rate that was lower than the rate offered by Home State. (Only <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> made no offer.) Ultimately, Mr. Fitzsimmons and Ms. Helton turned to <span class="companylink">Bank of Colorado</span>, a community bank based in Fort Collins, for a five-year loan with a five-year renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By many accounts, as the economy adds jobs, more small businesses are looking to borrow money, and more banks are eager to lend it -- at least to the right borrowers. ''It's actually a really great time to access small-business capital,'' said Keri Gohman, executive vice president and head of small-business banking for <span class="companylink">Capital One</span>. ''Rates are low and banks are also feeling the economic recovery. We really want to lend. Small-business owners can shop around and work with banks to find the best rates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But industry observers caution that both demand for, and access to, capital remain well below where they might be in a strong economy. For example, large banks approved 20 percent of small-business loan requests in June, up from 9 percent three years ago, according to data from Biz2Credit, an online small-business loan broker. But before the recession, the rate was around 36 percent, said Rohit Arora, Biz2Credit's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps surprisingly, banks seem more eager to lend than small businesses are to borrow. ''Demand is up 20 to 25 percent from the trough of the downturn, but that's still very subdued compared to before the downturn,'' said Paul Ballew, chief data and analytics officer for Dun &amp; Bradstreet. ''From the peak to the trough, there was about a 50 percent decline in that time. We're a little beyond halfway back, but we still have a long way to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason loan demand might be tempered is that many small businesses assume they will not qualify for a loan, said Jeff Stibel, chief executive of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credibility, an independent company that helps businesses manage their <span class="companylink">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</span> credit reports. According to Mr. Stibel, that is ''because they are oftentimes going to the wrong bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reality is that there are many lending institutions for any successful small business,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, observers say, more small businesses have regained their financial footing after years of hardship. ''On the back end of this cycle, businesses are as healthy as we've ever seen them,'' said Mr. Ballew. ''Balance sheets are in great shape, cash flows are in great shape, and their ability to pay their bills is in great shape.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the business owners' personal cash flows have improved, said Mr. Arora, and the value of their homes, which are often used for collateral, has stabilized if not risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The banks look at the overall global cash flow, which includes the business and personal side,'' Mr. Arora said. ''And both sides are improving, so as a result banks are seeing an overall improvement in credit quality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks say they have not loosened their credit standards with the recovery. ''We're using the same underwriting guidelines we were then, which is one of the reasons the bank is so strong and has such a strong capital base,'' said Lori Annand, Mr. Fitzsimmons's banker at <span class="companylink">Bank of Colorado</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent surveys of bank lending officers by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> have shown that some banks have been easing credit terms for smaller businesses since at least mid-2012. Some banks, Mr. Stibel said, are ''not putting such a heavy reliance on a borrower's performance over the last three years,'' which most likely suffered during the slow recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some banks are more willing to lend on lower credit scores, said James Chessen, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">American Bankers Association</span>, a trade group. ''The economy is getting better, and as the economy gets better, the risks that banks won't get repaid goes down,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One businesswoman who got a second look from a bank is Charlene Nagy, who owns Confluent Translations, a translation service in Pittsburgh that has four employees. Two years ago, Ms. Nagy began looking for a $30,000 line of credit, or ''that little extra cushion,'' as she put it. But with her ''consistently profitable'' business burdened by debt incurred by a former partner, the most she was offered was a credit card with a $13,000 limit or a term loan. Then an adviser suggested this year that she get in touch with <span class="companylink">First Niagara Bank</span>, based in Buffalo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the simplest phone call I've ever had,'' she said. Unlike past encounters with loan officers, she said, ''there were no mounds of paperwork.'' Ms. Nagy received the line of credit even though her company's financial situation has changed little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even growing companies can be turned away. In November 2011, James Marzilli started Marzilli Machine Company in Fall River, Mass., with a bank loan that he said required collateral worth twice as much as the loan itself. Today, he said, the company is ''slightly profitable'' on revenue that will approach $750,000 this year, about twice what it was last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when he went back to his bank for a line of credit, ''the bank said, 'We'd love to give you the money, but we don't know if we can, because you just don't have enough collateral,''' Mr. Marzilli said. ''They want to take almost no risk whatsoever.'' And, he added, ''I've had a checking account with these people for 15 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Marzilli expects to get his line of credit from a local economic development agency, Jobs for Fall River Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Colorado, perhaps the best part of the agreement Mr. Fitzsimmons managed to negotiate was that the bank agreed to give up its rights to his house once construction on the restaurant was complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody was asking me to pledge my home as security,'' he said. ''And I held the line on that, and eventually they let go of it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The television ad sponsored by the advocacy arm of the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> featured a small-business owner in Arkansas, frustrated at what he said were the higher bills he had seen since the Obama administration's health care plan went into effect -- and pointing blame at Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents facing re-election this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the largest chunk of the money donated to the nonprofit group's advocacy effort came not from small-business owners, but rather from health insurance companies trying to repeal a health care tax, the most recently available federal tax records show.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largely hidden role of the for-profit health insurers highlights the increasingly confusing world of campaign finance, as nonprofit groups such as the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> and its Voice of Free Enterprise program can keep their donor lists secret and then present their carefully fashioned message, financed in large part by big business, as if it is coming from, perhaps, a more sympathetic voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If people who see this ad have no idea who is actually bankrolling it, they are in effect being misinformed,'' said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks the influence of money in politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arkansas television ad, run in December, featured John Parke, the chief operating officer of Democrat Printing and Lithographing Company in Little Rock, Ark., a 143-year-old, family-run company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are a small business that has been part of the central Arkansas community for four generations,'' Mr. Parke says in the ad, paid for by Voice of Free Enterprise, which features scenes of worn-out printing presses and laborers hard at work. ''What Obamacare means for Arkansas small businesses is tough choices, the mandates, the increased costs, the increased taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tax records filed late last year by the group show $1.593 million of the organization's $4.9 million in revenue came from an anonymous donor in 2012, the largest single contribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the exact amount that <span class="companylink">America's Health Insurance Plans</span>, a trade association run by top executives from companies including <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> and UnitedHealthcare, lists as having spent on ''advocacy organizations as part of its advocacy efforts on issues associated with reform of the nation's health care system.'' The tax return prepared separately by <span class="companylink">America's Health Insurance Plans</span> does not disclose that it donated the money to, or at least spent it in collaboration with, the Voice of Free Enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a spokesman for <span class="companylink">America's Health Insurance Plans</span> confirmed that this is where the money went. Brendan Buck, the spokesman, noted that the health insurers' group issued a news release in 2011, when it decided to team up with the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> to raise concerns about the cost associated with health care. The ties between the two groups also have previously received news media attention in The National Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the viewers of the television ad in Arkansas, there would be no way to know that the message was actually paid for in part by health insurance companies, which are vehemently opposed to a tax on health care premiums that will cost insurers roughly $100 billion over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. Parke said in an interview, he was not told -- and in retrospect, he said, he should have been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was not aware of that,'' said Mr. Parke, who is said he is a member of the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>. ''It is relevant to understanding who is sponsoring the message.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major donor to the Voice of Free Enterprise campaign, a comparison of multiple federal tax records shows, was Freedom Partners, a group founded by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire corporate executives and owners of the Kansas-based <span class="companylink">Koch Industries</span>, who have been vocal critics of the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kipp Maloney, the executive director of Voice of Free Enterprise, did not dispute that several large contributions to his organizations came from groups with ties to large corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using that money, Voice of Free Enterprise has run a public-relations campaign it calls Stop the HIT, short for Health Insurance Tax, and helped pay for the television campaign in Arkansas. The organization also made so-called outside expenditures to help Republican congressional candidates through media buys or other election-related spending in the last election cycle, among other initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything we put out is squarely focused on the small business owner, their employees and the issues they face,'' Mr. Maloney said. ''I don't know how we could be confused with an organization fronting for some other groups.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vast majority of donors are small business owners, even if a handful of very large donations make up a large share of its overall budget, Mr. Maloney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> has a complicated legal structure: It has at least five separate nonprofit groups through which it moves money; at times, money is donated to one of the divisions but is then transferred and spent by another on an apparent political cause. The group calls the spots run in Arkansas ''issue ads,'' meaning they are not explicitly political and so would not affect the group's status as a nonprofit, even though they clearly point a finger at Mr. Pryor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> this year had considered changing the way political activity by such nonprofits is defined -- to try to impose greater limits on groups that do not need to disclose where they get their money. But after protests by conservative and liberal nonprofits, that effort was delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's unfortunate that new rules have been delayed,'' said Paul Ryan, senior counsel with the <span class="companylink">Campaign Legal Center</span>, a nonprofit watchdog that has pushed for the new rules. ''It allows groups like this to be used and abused and get around campaign finance and tax law disclosure requirements.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a mother in North Augusta, S.C., was arrested after authorities learned that she had dropped her 9-year-old daughter off at a nearby park while she worked her shift at a <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> restaurant. That news, along with a flurry of reports last week that she was fired from her job -- later found to be erroneous -- prompted public debate about the the difficulty of finding and affording child care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sympathetic woman, a stranger to the mother, even began a crowdfunding campaign on YouCaring.com called ''Support Debra Harrell.'' To date, it has raised nearly $40,000, far exceeding its $10,000 goal.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kindness of strangers is always welcome. But what working mothers really need are systematic ways to find and afford safe, local care options for their kids. While many parents scramble to find care in the summer months, especially for older children out of school, it's a year-round challenge for families with kids younger than preschool age. Twelve million infants (from birth to 4 years old) are in daily care with someone other than a primary parent, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resources for choosing a child-care provider are antiquated. Only 27 states even post reports online on both regular monitoring and inspections of child-care centers, and only 24 do for home-based child-care. In California, according to a recent report by The Center for Investigative Reporting, parents had to actually go in person or call during business hours to request reports on one of the 48,000 state-licensed day care, preschool and after-school programs. Even in the heart of Silicon Valley, reports aren't available online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs are high. Child Care Aware America, a national organization focused on quality childcare, reports that the annual cost of day care for an infant is more than the average cost of in-state tuition and fees at public colleges in 31 states. And according to the news site Vox, the problem is just getting worse; the cost of child care is growing at nearly twice the rate of prices economy-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quality of care is critical. We are learning more every day about how important the first three years are to brain development. Synapses essentially organize the brain by forming pathways that connect the parts of the brain governing everything we do. According to Zero to Three, a national advocacy group for families with infants, a healthy toddler may create two million synapses per second. The adults they interact with and the environments they're in on a regular basis hugely impact the quantity and quality of these connections -- influencing the rest of their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the stakes are so high and the costs so steep, how does an already overwhelmed working parent find a decent, affordable child-care provider?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Most Basic Safety</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents in some places are provided with more satisfying answers than in others. South Carolina, where Harrell is fighting to keep her daughter, is ranked 45th in the country for quality child care by Child Care Aware America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other states are demonstrating that some simple steps can go a long way in helping parents connect with the resources they need. Take Indiana (rated 12th). Parents in the Hoosier state can start by checking out the official inspection records of any day care center online at the Family and Social Services Administration website. This helps moms and dads figure out fundamentals about the safety of a prospective childcare provider, in addition to more subtle information, like when and how food is served, how many providers are on site or whether pets are allowed on the premises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting the complete reports online is only half the battle. Many parents don't have time to read them, and those who do can find them difficult to understand. Many are written in county code, not plain language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some child-care centers are reviewed on existing portals like Yelp, but there are drawbacks to trying to get good information there. Yelp doesn't include inspection reports along with its customer reviews, and as Melanie Brizzi of the Family and Social Services Administration Bureau of Child Care in Indiana explains, there's an economic incentive for centers to drum up good reviews. ''Families have always relied on word of mouth. Yelp is the newest form of that, but parents have to remember that it is a commercial site,'' not one designed to best serve families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Indiana, parents don't just have access to the official inspections. They can also educate themselves by going to Paths to Quality, a website where regulated child-care providers can volunteer to be rated on a simple scale of 1 to 4. No bureaucratic language to wade through here. They've even produced a video explainer that helps parents understand the various issues they might consider when choosing day care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why is it that Indiana has managed to create such accessible resources for busy parents and other states, like South Carolina and California, are stuck in the dark ages?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the answer is that Indiana was ahead of the legislative curve. A statute passed in 2000 required the local bureau to post inspection information online (California just passed a similar statute). By 2001, Indiana was complying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving Beyond Compliance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the decade wore on, its ambition grew beyond mere compliance. By 2006, the state began training inspectors to record their findings in the field on small tablet computers. Not only did this save time for the inspectors, but there were fewer errors created by transferring data from paper to computer. Monitoring became easier with the custom-built system; noncompliance could be tracked automatically. Indiana worked with a tech company called the Consultants Consortium to build the web-based portal and train the inspectors. The transition was complete by 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once that system was running smoothly, it freed the bureau up to think about ways to make information on child care even more accessible for busy Indiana parents. The Paths to Quality website was operating by 2009. Since then, there has been a steady increase in parents using the site; last year 10,677 searched for child care using Indiana's official search engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every state has a number of physical centers that parents can go to for references to quality child-care providers and other information on subsidies. They're known as Child Care Resource and Referral centers, or C.C.R.&amp;R.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these centers vary greatly in their quality. And parents just don't use many of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiana, recognizing that many people don't have the time or desire to go to a physical center, created a centralized call service in 2012. Indiana's friendly operators gather relevant information (the family's home address, number of kids and their ages, how much parents can pay and what days they need help, their preferences regarding in home vs. stand-alone center vs. ministerial care, etc.) and then compile a customized list of good options for the caller which they can email or go over in real time on the phone. They can even read inspections with callers to be sure they understand the nature of violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These same operators also field any complaints, which further holds providers accountable between inspections, and helps worried parents find alternative care options as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The call center, which fielded nearly 9,000 calls last year, is open during regular business hours, but has extended hours once a week and is also open Saturdays. Parents can leave a message and are guaranteed to get a call back within 24 hours. They can also email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Economic Case for Quality Care</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Indiana's population (7 million) is small compared with those of many other states (including California, which has 38 million residents), but the majority of fixes -- inspectors armed with tablets in the field, the easier-to-understand ranking system, the centralized call center -- wouldn't be difficult to scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The class implications are startling. Working-class parents are less likely to have maternity and/or paternity leave -- special time to start nurturing those first synapses and smiles themselves; they also don't have as much flexibility during the workday to visit referral centers, tour day care centers or request inspection reports in person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States like Indiana that have committed to helping parents find and afford quality care are making an investment in the future of their state, and the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted Maple, the president and chief executive of the Day Nursery Association of Indianapolis, believes that making it easier for parents to find quality care isn't just right, but smart for states (especially those struggling to lower unemployment). In fact, the economic argument was pivotal in helping Indiana pass recent legislation that will help more kids -- especially poor kids -- thrive in safe, stimulating day care settings. Maple explains, ''We had great bipartisan support for the bill, in large part, because business got behind it. Big employers argued that it's hard for them to retain great workers when they can't find or afford quality child care. There is a growing recognition in the business community that early childhood education has a long-term payoff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indiana law, which goes into effect in May, also provides incentives to day care centers to improve their facilities and hire more workers through increased reimbursement rates for good inspections. That's good for cash-strapped caregivers, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While few studies exist on the link between improving parents' capacity to find quality child care and a thriving economy, related research on the bottom line benefits of early-childhood programs are plentiful. In 2007, for example, Ludwig of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> and Deborah Phillips of Georgetown found that there was a $7 to $9 return on investment for every $1 invested in Head Start, a federal program that promotes the school readiness of children ages birth to 5 from low-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some controversy surrounding studies like these, but most researchers agree that Head Start, and programs like it, have been shown to have lasting positive effects on children in areas such as future college attendance and fewer criminal offenses in young adulthood, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brizzi explains, ''Too often we still see that the poorest quality room in a child-care center is the one that has the infants and toddlers. It's an afterthought -- the babies just need to be fed and have their diapers changed. But there is a growing awareness, thanks to all of the great research coming out, about how important the infant stage really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we need to get that research out and make a focused investment that starts with empowering parents. We have a long way to go.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, Kunal Bahl and his high school buddy Rohit Bansal had modest ambitions for their online shopping site, Snapdeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their previous venture -- a physical coupon booklet into which they had sunk their combined savings -- flopped in just months. And online retailing was still a largely unproven endeavor in 2010, particularly in India, a country where most people don't have bank accounts, let alone credit cards to make purchases on the Internet. When an angel investor offered $200,000 as seed money, they took only half and aimed for just 100 transactions a day.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Snapdeal is now on track to handle more than $1 billion in sales this year for over 30,000 merchants across more than 500 categories of goods and services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We sell a sari every 12 seconds,'' Mr. Bahl said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise of Indian e-commerce -- which has started to gain traction only in recent years -- has captured the attention of international investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Snapdeal has raised $233 million, with about half coming from the American Internet company <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. Mr. Bahl said Snapdeal was considering an initial public offering in a year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least half a dozen other leading Indian shopping sites have announced major fund-raising deals in recent months. On Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span>, India's largest e-commerce company, said that it had raised $1 billion from investors, including American firms like Tiger Global and <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>. The amount represents the largest ever for an Indian Internet company, and globally, it matches <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s fund-raising round in February 2011 and ranks only second to Uber's $1.2 billion bonanza this June, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''E-commerce in India is poised to take advantage of larger shifts in society,'' said Vani Kola, now the managing director of Kalaari Capital and formerly of NEA-IndoUS Ventures, Indian-based venture capital firms that both have invested in Snapdeal. ''The whole industry has begun swiftly growing and evolving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment surge reflects the changing landscape in India. Internet access has rapidly expanded, mostly through mobile devices, and Indians are now increasingly shifting daily activity online, like reading the newspaper, doing bank transactions and buying goods and services, from shoes to refrigerators (with installation included).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billboards, text messages and emails bombard people every day with news of deep online-only discounts and special offers. E-commerce is growing at a compound annual rate of 34 percent, according to the <span class="companylink">Internet and Mobile Association of India</span>, an industry trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But online shopping remains a largely untapped market. While estimates of the total worth of India's online retail industry vary greatly, most analysts figure that it accounts for less than 1 percent of the country's $500 billion retail market, which is still mostly cash-driven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparatively, China's e-commerce sales are expected to top $180 billion this year, accounting for roughly 9 percent of the country's retail spending, according to iResearch Consulting, which specializes in China's Internet industry. The country's largest online retailer, Alibaba, is expected to go public in the coming months with an estimated value of more than $200 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's tremendous headroom still,'' Mr. Bahl said. ''I think 20 years from now, 20 percent of retail will be online.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet particularities to India's shopping culture have impeded the industry's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By and large, India remains a bastion of the ''kirana,'' or neighborhood general store, as well as the roving hawkers, whose nasal cries carry the names of their wares through narrow lanes and up to the top floors of apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people tend to shop from sellers they know personally and live near, running grains of rice through their fingers and smelling the different varieties to determine their quality before, perhaps, moving to the next shop where they might closely inspect the stitch count of a new batch of shirts sold by the local ready-made clothes dealer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These entrenched habits, combined with the newness of the Internet and credit cards, have led to a trust gap between online retailers and their customers. To bridge it, the biggest names in e-commerce, including Snapdeal and <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span>, allow customers to pay cash upon delivery for their purchases and let consumers return items at the very last second, even when the delivery person arrives at their door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address the widespread perception that the state's postal service is unreliable, e-commerce players like Snapdeal, <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span> and Jabong have developed their own delivery logistics companies. Snapdeal and others have built fulfillment centers and hired delivery workers to help ensure packages arrive in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logistic network, in part, has helped Snapdeal court small business owners to its marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the early days,'' Mr. Bahl said, ''we were calling every family and friend who we knew was running a small business or wanting to start one, and for whom nationwide distribution would be a godsend. It was quite hard to convince them, given many of them hadn't ever used the Internet themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Momentum is now on the industry's side. Mr. Bahl said that the company barely needed to recruit merchants any more, with 80 percent requesting to join Snapdeal. ''Virality amongst small business owners is very acute,'' Mr. Bahl said. ''If one sees success, then word spreads really, really fast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once merchants join the site, Snapdeal works with them to develop their listings and bolster sales. When Rakesh Sareen, 29, started selling his line of traditional women's clothing made of locally sourced materials, Snapdeal, as part of its services, promoted the introduction and covered the cost of a photo shoot and online catalog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They send out targeted newsletters, which promote our products, and their fashion category manager advises us on trends as well as updates on how certain products of mine are selling,'' said Mr. Sareen, who had just returned from a trip to the villages where he buys woven fabric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looming large over the industry is last year's entrance in India of Amazon. Huge American online retailers like Amazon and <span class="companylink">eBay</span> own marketplace platforms here, which, like Snapdeal and <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span>, connect merchants with consumers. But the country's regulations prevent Amazon and other overseas players from selling directly to consumers from their own inventory as they do elsewhere. Currently, foreign investment in multibrand retail is limited to 51 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are hints that the system may be changing, at least in the online space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, is perceived as backing small business owners who fear that opening retailing to foreign behemoths will put them out of business. But Narendra Modi, India's new prime minister, recently urged the industry to embrace change at a widely televised rally during his election campaign. ''There is no need to fear global challenges,'' said Mr. Modi, adding, ''this is the age of online marketing, so accept modern science and make use of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon in particular stands to benefit from any change to the existing rules. ''Customer loyalty isn't so strong yet, so it's conceivable that Amazon would either look to buy big names here, or their expansion might just kill some of the smaller horizontals altogether,'' said Nikhil Pahwa, the founder and editor of Medianama.com, which analyzes India's digital economy. On Monday, Amazon announced that it would open five new fulfillment centers across India to bring its nationwide total to seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent email, a spokeswoman for Amazon in India affirmed that the company was in ''continual dialogue'' with the government and that it strongly supports ''opening up this sector'' to foreign direct investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bahl of Snapdeal seems unfazed. ''It wouldn't affect our marketplace,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the next year, he thinks Snapdeal's network of sellers will reach 100,000, and the company plans to double its number of fulfillment centers as well as engineering employees. As for the prospect of competition from Amazon, he thinks that small businesses will congregate on marketplace platforms like Snapdeal's so as to collaboratively compete against the giants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're the ones who are going to help small businesses compete against Amazon,'' Mr. Bahl said. ''We are that platform.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Garett <span class="companylink">Fortune</span>'s brother was found to have cancer in early 2013, it was so advanced that all he could do was to try to live out the remainder of his life in as little pain and discomfort as possible. That meant taking about 30 pills a day, Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> said -- until his brother tried marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw him go from 30 pills a day to almost zero,'' he said. ''It helped his appetite and the nausea. He had a way better quality of life at the end than he would have without the cannabis. It made me a proponent of the industry.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also gave Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> the idea for a business. With more states legalizing marijuana for medical uses -- and, in Colorado and Washington, recreational ones -- Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> identified one of the industry's challenges: packaging. The old standby, the resealable plastic bag, was not sufficiently effective, especially for a regulated industry, and Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> already owned OdorNo, a company that made odor-proof bags for human and animal waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> proposed a new product, odor-proof and child-resistant marijuana bags, to OdorNo's advisory board. He expected the members to laugh him out of the room, but they did not. ''Every single one of them told me: 'This is the biggest opportunity on the planet right now. Follow that.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May he licensed out production and distribution of OdorNo, and he and his team began building FunkSac in Denver. Although FunkSac bags are awaiting government approval, Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> said he had hundreds of thousands of orders from cultivators, dispensaries and wholesalers. The company plans to begin delivering them this month and estimates it will have first-year revenue of about $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> said he had been contacted by dispensaries in 17 of the 22 states where medical marijuana was legal. ''Right now,'' he said, ''it's like drinking from a fire hose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many, today's cannabis industry resembles a modern-day Gold Rush. Troy Dayton, co-founder and chief executive of the ArcView Group in San Francisco, a network of 250 high-net-worth investors that backs cannabis start-ups, said more than 30 early-stage companies contact it every week. In the last year, he said, the group sent about $12 million in funding to 14 companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the legal cannabis industry in the United States, measured by sales of the plant, was $1.5 billion in 2013, according to ArcView, which projects it will reach $2.6 billion in 2014 and $10 billion by 2018 -- figures that do not include the growing numbers of ancillary businesses. The entire industry is dominated by small businesses, Mr. Dayton said, both because it is so new and because marijuana's legality remains murky. Banks, for example, have been reluctant to take deposits or make loans to dispensaries because the drug is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't have a national business,'' Mr. Dayton said, because the laws vary by state. Opportunities for small businesses also exist because the stigma associated with the industry has discouraged bigger companies from getting involved. ''You can't find another industry growing at this clip that doesn't have any major players,'' he said. ''That gives the little guy a chance to make a run at this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That potential has spawned a wide array of cannabis start-ups -- many incorporating novel technologies. Potbotics in New York City has raised almost $3 million from friends and family and has three cannabis-related products in the works, including a ''virtual budtender'' known as Potbot that it expects to be available for sale next year. A budtender is a dispensary worker who is knowledgeable about and sells marijuana; Potbot is a robot with a tablet-size monitor that is meant to replace the budtender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to place Potbot robots in dispensaries and medical facilities where marijuana patients can ask questions and get information. ''Dispensary budtenders almost always have an agenda -- they are trying to sell what they have most in their stock,'' said David Goldstein, a founder of the company, which was started in October. ''We created a software and technology platform that is able to talk to patients and educate them about what strains are actually best for their ailments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A San Diego start-up, Herbalizer, makes a small, sleek vaporizer with a heating system that took three years and two engineers to develop. Its co-founder and chief executive, Josh Young, previously designed advanced NASA computer systems and military programs; Bob Pratt, a co-founder and the chief technology officer, was a designer of stealth bomber radar systems. And yet, Mr. Young said, the technology behind the Herbalizer ''has been the greatest challenge of our lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vaporizer heats up in seconds and uses a 32-megahertz processor, a 300-watt halogen bulb and a temperature sensor to release active compounds in the plant selectively, without creating smoke. Ninety percent of Herbalizer's customers use it for marijuana, Mr. Young said, although drug paraphernalia laws prevent the device from being marketed for that purpose (it is sold instead for use with herbs like peppermint and lavender). The company expects first-year revenue of more than $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund-raising has been tricky for Herbalizer and similar companies. Traditional investors remain leery, said Christian Groh, a partner and the chief operations officer at <span class="companylink">Privateer Holdings</span>, a private equity firm in Seattle that invests in cannabis start-ups. ''In the U.S., marijuana remains a Schedule I narcotic, so you still have this outlaw mentality within the community,'' he said. ''I know there's a lot of exuberance now, but I don't think we're at the point where we'll see real institutional money or a <span class="companylink">Fortune</span> 500 company making a play in this space. Not yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, Privateer bought <span class="companylink">Leafly</span>, a Seattle start-up that provides consumer ratings and reviews of marijuana strains, dispensaries and recreational shops. Most dispensaries carry 20 to 50 strains, Mr. Groh said, and the lack of standardization and consistency is a big issue. <span class="companylink">Leafly</span> has about 80,000 reviews in its system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That information has to come from the community right now, because there is no <span class="companylink">WebMD</span> for marijuana,'' said Cy Scott, one of <span class="companylink">Leafly</span>'s founders. The company also offers tools for dispensaries that let them manage inventory, update menus online and respond to reviews. Dispensaries and recreational shops pay a monthly subscription fee of $200 to $2,000 a month, said Mr. Scott, who expects revenue this year of $3.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SpeedWeed, a Los Angeles delivery service, allows customers to place an order online or by phone and have it delivered -- depending on traffic -- within 45 minutes. Although there are hundreds of marijuana delivery services in Los Angeles, AJ Gentile, a founder, said SpeedWeed was the largest. ''Delivery services here are typically guys driving around in their car with a big box of weed,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gentile said that SpeedWeed worked only with cultivators its legal team had vetted and that along with its delivery service, it planned to sell proprietary software to dispensaries nationwide. He estimated that the company had 20,000 legal customers and that revenue would double this year, up from $1.7 million in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biological Advantage, founded in April, has a system of products it plans to introduce this month that are applied to a marijuana plant's soil and leaves to enhance photosynthesis. The company's chief executive, John Kempf, is also founder of Advancing Eco Agriculture, a crop-nutrition consulting company he started that has invested $400,000 in Biological Advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kempf said his companies were a bit ahead of the game, anticipating what the market would need. ''Growers aren't yet looking at nutrition as a means for improving the medicinal concentrations in plants,'' he said. ''But they will.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A catchy, even irrelevant idea is seemingly all an aspiring entrepreneur needs these days to raise money on crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter -- a point driven home this summer when a Columbus, Ohio, developer, Zack Brown, raised $55,492 to make a potato salad.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, researchers are tapping into the growing data on crowdfunding to take stock of the phenomenon. A central question: Do crowds -- driven by a herd mentality, crowd euphoria or sheer silliness -- gravitate toward funding seemingly irrelevant ideas? Or can crowds make rational funding decisions and, better yet, exceed venture capital investors and other traditional gatekeepers in identifying promising projects?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent academic study explored those questions by looking at theater projects on Kickstarter. In that study, researchers tracked 120 theater-related campaigns on Kickstarter between May 2009 and June 2012 that aimed to raise at least $10,000. Researchers also asked 30 professionals, all with experience in evaluating applications for grant-making organizations like the <span class="companylink">National Endowment for the Arts</span>, to evaluate those same campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their findings: Crowds and experts agreed substantially on what makes promising theater. Where crowds and experts disagreed, crowds were generally more willing to fund projects. Yet projects picked only by the crowd were as likely to deliver on budget -- and achieve commercial success and positive critical acclaim -- as projects favored by experts. The crowd, in effect, picked strong projects that experts might not have recognized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The crowd is often thought as being crazy. There was a sense that they would back musicals about Internet cats, and experts would back serious work,'' said Ethan R. Mollick an assistant professor of management at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School</span>. ''It turns out the crowd does consider the quality of projects and outcomes pretty well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason crowds might do as well, or even better, at picking promising projects is that they tend to be more diverse and might avoid, for example, some of the gender biases that have long directed the bulk of the venture capital funding to male entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two recent studies of Kickstarter projects have found that crowndfunding is indeed opening entrepreneurship and investing to more women. A recent study of 16,000 Kickstarter projects, by researchers at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span> and the <span class="companylink">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</span>, found that female investors were more likely to invest in female entrepreneurs, and that these female entrepreneurs enjoyed higher rates of success in reaching their funding goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another study by Jason Greenberg at New York University's Stern School of Business and Mr. Mollick also found higher proportions of female funders led to higher success rates in capital-raising for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital investors are scrambling to tap the wisdom of the crowd, financing projects that found their first legs in crowdfunding. In the last quarter of 2013 alone, 10 previously crowdfunded hardware start-ups raised a total of over $150 million, according to a report published on Monday by CB Insights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span>, the virtual reality company that raised $2.4 million on Kickstarter, was acquired by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for $2 billion. And with 19 deals through July, investor deal activity to crowdfunded hardware companies is on pace to break 2013's record this year, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding platforms have become ''a valuable source for dealflow'' for venture capital investors, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, what explains the success of potato salad guy? Or projects like the first-ever all-pug production of Hamlet, successfully funded this month?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Wharton School</span>'s Mr. Mollick shrugs off those examples. ''Sometimes, there's just weirdness on the Internet. The Internet likes strange things.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ST. LOUIS -- An online fund-raising drive for the Ferguson, Mo., police officer who shot an unarmed African-American teenager to death on Aug. 9 surpassed $300,000 by Saturday afternoon, as dozens of people gathered at a St. Louis pub to rally on the lawman's behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One fund-raising web page raised so much money in so few days that it was shut down and a second page was opened, with its donations being directed to a fund managed by the local Fraternal Order of Police lodge. In all, the two pages, which both are on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe, have raised more than $300,000 for the officer, Darren Wilson.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The individual who started the fund didn't realize it would get so big,'' said a woman who organized Saturday's rally. When pressed for her name, she said only, ''I am Darren Wilson,'' a play on the popular mantra that emerged after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman said donations were pouring in from around the nation from people of different races, most of whom were afraid to show their faces or publicly give their names. The site had to remove nasty comments being posted by people angry at Officer Wilson and by people criticizing the 18-year-old he shot, Michael Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A related <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page for Officer Wilson had nearly 60,000 ''likes.'' The rally organizer said the page was being monitored for vitriol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are working around the clock to clear the hate,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement she read aloud on Saturday, she said: ''Our mission is to formally declare that we share the united belief that Officer Wilson's actions on Aug. 9 were warranted and justified, and he has our unwavering support. We believe that the evidence has and will continue to validate our position.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also criticized the news media for offering what she called one-sided coverage that ''intensified the destruction'' of Ferguson and neighboring communities, alluding to the looting that came after the shooting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants in the rally wore T-shirts with a logo in the form of a police shield that said, ''Officer Darren Wilson I Stand With You.'' They were marked ''8.9.14'' for the date of the shooting. One attendee paid $200 for the shirt, the organizer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organizers of the rally said the proceeds would help relocate Officer Wilson's family and support him because he was unlikely to be able to work on the streets of Ferguson again. It would also help him if he were to be indicted or sued, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another fund-raising drive on the same crowdfunding site, for Michael Brown's family, reached $200,000 on Saturday. And daily protests continued in support of the slain black teenager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ferguson, 300 to 400 people held a peaceful march Saturday afternoon down West Florissant Avenue, which in previous nights was the scene of violent outbreaks. The march was organized by the St. Louis County chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and was led by three of the law enforcement officers who have been tasked with trying to maintain peace and safety in Ferguson: Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, and Chiefs Sam Dotson of the St. Louis Police Department and Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, hundreds of protesters marched through busy commercial streets on a damp Saturday evening to protest the killing of Mr. Brown. Organizers -- including the activist groups National Black United Front and the Answer Coalition -- targeted the Chinatown neighborhood, said Eugene Young, a spokesman for the Answer Coalition, because ''if there's not going to be justice for Michael Brown, then there won't be any economic peace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demonstrators demanded the arrest of Officer Wilson, the demilitarization of police departments and the addition of cameras to police officers' uniforms. Also on Saturday, the White House announced that the Obama administration would send representatives to Mr. Brown's funeral in Ferguson on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The representatives are Broderick Johnson, assistant to the president, White House cabinet secretary and chairman of the My Brother's Keeper task force; Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Heather Foster, adviser for the White House Office of Public Engagement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marshall is a native of St. Louis and attended high school with Mr. Brown's mother, the White House said. The supporters of Officer Wilson who gathered at Barney's Sports Pub in St. Louis on Saturday said they did so because the news media was biased against the officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am here to make sure justice is served,'' said Greg Messmer, a police officer from a nearby community. ''Unfortunately, because of the bias of the media, they've come to the conclusion that he is guilty before the evidence is presented.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Redden, who said she was a ''police mom,'' donated $60 and handed out snacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want our city to give up on law enforcement,'' Ms. Redden said. ''These men are good men. I think some people are giving up on trusting them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few counterprotesters showed up by the rally, but the two groups largely ignored each other, though one heckler got into a brief shouting match with the officer's supporters.</p>

Chancellor Angela Merkel attributed some of her own country's decline in the second quarter to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, over which tit-for-tat sanctions threaten trade. The Munich-based Ifo, a research firm, echoed some of those sentiments as it reported its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 companies, fell to a worse-than-expected 106.3 from 108, the lowest level in more than a year. The findings agreed with data earlier in the month on the second-quarter contraction in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy. Klaus Wohlrabe, an Ifo economist, said his institute expected growth in Germany to be ''close to zero'' in the third quarter.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, right before the dot-com bubble popped, Lawrence Coburn quit his corporate job and dove into the Internet gold rush, raising $600,000 from friends and family -- including his grandmother -- for a consumer ratings site he founded called RateItAll. At the time, virtually any idea, no matter how far-fetched, seemed to hold the promise of a high-flying initial public offering, making it easy to attract financial backing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when technology stocks collapsed and venture capital dried up, RateItAll ran out of cash by 2001.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mr. Coburn, 45, who now runs a start-up in San Francisco called DoubleDutch (and who only managed to pay back his grandmother after her death -- returning the money to her estate), fears that history may repeat itself. Without an immediate need for the money, he said concerns about a possible downturn factored into his decision to raise $19 million of equity and debt financing last month for DoubleDutch, which makes an app for organizing events. He readily received the money from some leading Silicon Valley investors, including Peter Thiel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley has more money than it knows what to do with these days, leaving venture capitalists and other investors practically begging elite start-ups to take their cash. And the entrepreneurs are happy to oblige.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With young start-ups receiving lofty valuations -- and with conflicts around the globe stoking fears of a market correction -- some entrepreneurs say worries about a possible downturn are partly why they are stocking up on financing, essentially taking out insurance on the risk of lean times ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you've been through those boom cycles, you're looking for signs that the next one is coming, and you're very fearful of that,'' Mr. Coburn said. ''You don't want to be stuck out raising money when the curtain call comes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when many consumer tech brands like Uber and Snapchat are bursting with financing that values them at $10 billion or more, lesser-known but promising firms are also attracting prominent investors. Even traditionally conservative investors like <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span> are competing for access to the hottest tech deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of the year, investors put $22.7 billion into venture capital deals in the United States, 71 percent more than in the period last year, according to <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> and the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>, which used data from Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising this additional money comes at a cost to the start-ups: Venture capitalists often demand preferred stock, which can give them the right to recover their investment if the company is sold at a lower price. But in the flood of capital, many entrepreneurs are able to raise money on favorable terms and secure rich valuations. In the second quarter of this year, the average share price at which companies raised financing was 113 percent higher than the price in their previous financing round, according to the law firm <span class="companylink">Fenwick &amp; West</span>, which analyzed 174 financings in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the investor enthusiasm is now mixed with a modicum of concern. A survey of venture capitalists in the second quarter by Mark V. Cannice, an entrepreneurship professor at the University of San Francisco School of Management, produced a reading of 4.02 on a five-point scale of confidence. While high, that level was virtually flat from the first quarter of the year, ending a seven-quarter streak of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very cyclical industry, and entrepreneurs know that,'' said Raphael Amit, a professor of entrepreneurship and management at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</span>. Entrepreneurs, he said, are raising money ''very prudently as a hedge, if you will, not knowing how things will develop in the future when they really need the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who cite such fears typically have a few years' more business experience than the youngest 20-somethings in tech. Kevin Hartz, 44, the chief executive of Eventbrite, an online ticketing service, said market concerns contributed to the company's move to raise $60 million this year, at a valuation of $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hartz has lived through two major slumps. In 2001, after the dot-com crash, he helped found Xoom, a money transfer company, but said he found it ''impossible'' to raise financing. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 only worsened the financial climate. ''We just had to bootstrap it,'' Mr. Hartz said. Xoom, after 12 years in business, finally went public last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had a similar experience in the early days of <span class="companylink">Eventbrite</span>, which he helped start in 2006. When the financial crisis of 2008 struck, <span class="companylink">Eventbrite</span> was repeatedly turned down by venture capitalists, Mr. Hartz recalled. ''We just hunkered down,'' he said. Then, in 2009, <span class="companylink">Eventbrite</span> attracted $6.5 million from Sequoia Capital, in its first venture capital investment, opening the door to additional financing rounds from other firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley is full of similar stories. Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Netflix, who joined the company in 1999, recalled its $50 million financing round in early 2000, shortly before the dot-com crash. He said that the amount was significantly more than <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> -- which at the time was a company that primarily rented DVDs by mail -- knew what to do with, but that the decision to take the money proved crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though our business model was working quite well, we would not have had access to capital and we would have had to close the company if we hadn't raised the extra money,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some fear a return to the unreal economy of the late 1990s. And those voices are growing louder, stoking debate in the tech world. One prominent venture capitalist, George Zachary, a partner at <span class="companylink">Charles River Ventures</span> who was an early investor in <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, contends that Silicon Valley is in an expanding bubble, and he has been using his <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> feed over the last year to cite evidence for that claim. Keeping a close eye on the public markets, Mr. Zachary also projects that a geopolitical shock like the conflicts in Ukraine or Iraq could set off a market correction and, in turn, constrain financing for tech firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many executives and investors are looking for indications that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> might raise interest rates. Public markets are important for private company investors because many use public company capitalizations as a yardstick for start-up valuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Zachary said his declarations had generated perplexed responses.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I met Manuel seven years ago on the set of my first porn shoot. I was quiet and nervous and huddled away on a couch in a back room, burning through coffee and the W-9 tax packet I had been handed on my way in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manuel sat next to me and introduced himself. He had a French accent and a thick mess of dark hair. ''We'll be working together,'' he said, an innocuous comment under normal circumstances but a loaded one when the work is porn.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was a 21-year-old college student earning good money as a house dancer in a strip club in my hometown, Sacramento. At 19, I had earned my first associate degree and transferred to Sacramento State. What I wanted from a college education was stability and financial security, because during my childhood we had had neither.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two decades earlier, my mother thought she had done everything right. She had enrolled in college and knocked out the general requirements while working an office job at a firm related to the career she intended to pursue. There she met my father -- a handsome, well-educated finance guy with an aggressive style and big ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They dated for a few years, married and about nine months later welcomed a child into the world: me. They decided that the rest of my mother's college funds would go toward a down payment on a house, and she would stay home with the baby. It was 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years later, I sat with my mother on her bed in a house we would soon lose while she read me a last bedtime story before her water broke and she carted us to the hospital for the birth of my sister. By then my father was gone for good, attending to another pregnancy he was responsible for, leaving my mother financially strapped with full-time responsibility for two young children. She never remarried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up, I was constantly aware of my mother's penny-pinching anxiety: the quiet calculations as she added up the cost of our school supplies, the flashes of anger each time we outgrew clothes. She would sit my sister and me down and hammer home the importance of education, making us promise we would put a college degree ahead of everything. ''Secure your security,'' she would say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's what I intended to do. Then, a year into college, I began stripping. And the money I made allowed a radical change in my standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In no time, I paid off my car loan. Next came savings, stocks and a mortgage. Meanwhile, I was closing in on a degree in a field that didn't interest me and one in which I wouldn't earn close to what I was already making. Throw in a suddenly tanking economy, and college began looking less like the ticket to financial security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing market plunged, I felt trapped. I did, that is, until one slow Friday night at work when a man dropped $30 in my lap to hear him out. The next week I was on a plane for Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porn is a business of surprising contradictions. Many of the roles women play are submissive and subservient: We are the bored housewife, the penniless pizza customer (who must pay her bill in other ways) and the vulnerable secretary. But unlike in the real world, women in porn usually make more money than men for the same work, and with that can come a liberating power, both financially and sexually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years that followed my first shoot, I traveled the world -- Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia. By the time I was 23, I had started my own lucrative online subscription club. I also negotiated deals for novelty sex toys and landed one of the highest-paying performing contracts in the industry, a five-year deal that increased in value each year and promised roles in the biggest features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through it all, I avoided dating anyone seriously because I felt safe and free on my own, and because I'd pledged I would never let a man compromise what I had worked so hard for. Then I found myself on set again with Manuel, for the first time since our last time, four years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had been too busy to notice that he'd been avoiding me all those years because he had found me cold during our first encounter. And I was. Making porn can be exhilarating, friendly and hot, but those first shoots took courage, and my lack of experience showed in how distant I acted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manuel greeted me with his customary politeness, which I would later learn was forced, right up until the director called for action and we kissed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.K., so maybe a kiss is a strange way for two porn stars to fall in love, but for us it's true. I developed a maddening crush on him, and my affection seemed to be returned. But he was in a relationship, and I was still as career-minded as ever, so our attraction stayed confined to the porn set, once a month as part of my shooting schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, though, our attraction boiled over. Manuel was out of his relationship, and I was comfortably settled in my generous long-term contract, the kind almost nobody got anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day he asked if we could see each other off set. I knew where this could lead and what I stood to lose. If I were to let a relationship derail my contract, I would never get it back. I said yes anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Navigating love when both of our jobs involve having sex with other people can be stressful, and this especially began to bother Manuel; he would get jealous and moody in the days before my shoots. He knew it wasn't fair to ask me to stop, but he couldn't hide the way he felt. Finally he said he wanted me to quit my contract and move in with him, with the logical next steps being marriage and children. I was 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It felt like an impossible choice. When I imagined the vulnerability of being dependent on a man, coupled with the irreversible commitment of having a child, I waited for the panic to hit. My biggest fear was repeating the past: becoming a single mother, financially insolvent, halfway through a college degree and left to raise my future children alone. One day, a panic attack came on so strong that I had to drive myself to the hospital with numb hands and dimming vision. Nightmares and weight loss followed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manuel tried to talk me down. ''Did you hear me?'' he asked. ''I want to marry you. I want to have a baby with you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, I just decided that nothing I secured on my own could compete with how solid I felt with Manuel, building a life together. Today, more than a year later, we have a child and are engaged. Our daughter's first tooth has just broken through the gum. Manuel looks at her in awe, then at me the same way, and says, ''This is us!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although I gave up my lucrative contract, I continue to perform on occasion, though only with Manuel or with other women. I still make a good living in the business, along with my appearances and products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it's a double standard that Manuel gets to perform with other women while I don't with other men, just as it's a double standard that he still works full time while I have cut back. But I am the mother of an infant daughter, and caring for her is my priority right now, just as providing for us as best he can is Manuel's priority. In the end, our calculation isn't so different from the choice millions of other working couples face these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is different is that I happen to love a decent, charming man whose work involves having sex with other women. And one strange reality of our lives is I often help ready those women for the shoots. Makeup is done in our dining room, where I assist with wardrobe, props and scripts, and then Manuel carts the cast and crew to the day's location. Sometimes he performs with the women and sometimes he doesn't. I don't ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm human, though, and I admit I size up the women in the makeup chair. Is she sexier than I am? Smarter? Better in bed? No woman can be everything. For example, she can't be the next woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's the thing: If we lose our lover's attention to someone else, it doesn't matter if that erosion happens on a porn shoot, with a secretary at the office or between two academics attending a conference. My sizing up a woman will have zero effect on whether my relationship unravels when I'm not looking. There is simply no way to know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only safeguard, for any of us, is how we maintain our love along the way and the care we take in choosing a partner in the first place.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN 18-year-old Kiana Neisig added up her expenses for college, she found herself short of funds, even after receiving grants and student loans. So in June, a friend set up a profile for her on a crowdfunding website to help her seek donations of roughly $2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neisig soon received 14 donations totaling $1,350, including a $500 gift from an anonymous donor. She has now started classes at <span class="companylink">George Fox University</span>, a small college in Newberg, Ore., where yearly tuition and fees are more than $31,000. She plans to use the money to help cover living expenses next semester. The website made it easier to seek help, she said. ''Personally, it would be difficult for me to approach even friends and close family and ask for money,'' she said, adding that she was ''honored'' by the support she received.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site she used, GoFundMe, is one of many crowdfunding sites that use the power of social media to raise money for a variety of purposes. But while sites like Kickstarter are geared toward funding creative projects and entrepreneurs, GoFundMe and other sites, like Crowdrise, let individuals pursue personal fund-raising. You create a profile, including a photo and an explanation of what you're seeking the money for, and then spread the word on networks like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GoFundMe says it has raised $420 million across all categories since 2010; education is the second-most-popular category, after medical treatments. When asked via email how many students reach their initial fund-raising target, GoFundMe's chief executive, Brad Damphousse, did not directly answer. Rather, he replied, the site's users can change their goal whenever they want, and they don't have to set a deadline for reaching it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Kickstarter, which requires its users to meet a goal to get the money, GoFundMe and Crowdrise allow individuals to keep the donations whether or not the goal is met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdrise's chief executive, Robert Wolfe, said his site had recently added an option for individuals -- rather than recognized charities -- to raise funds and that the educational category is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sebastian Summers, an aspiring actor and film producer from San Antonio, set up a profile on GoFundMe in June, with a goal of raising $10,000 to help cover his costs at the Chicago College of Performing Arts, part of <span class="companylink">Roosevelt University</span>. (Scholarships are covering much of his tuition.) So far, he has received $350 and some encouraging notes. While he's grateful for the support, he said, ''To be honest, it was a little disappointing.'' He speculated that perhaps his story lacked drama. ''I'm just an art student going to college,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heart-rending stories tend to gain the most attention and donations from beyond a student's circle of friends. A <span class="companylink">Vanderbilt University</span> student whose profile told of her mother's suicide shortly before her freshman year raised $50,000, double her goal. And GoFundMe says its most successful campaign raised more than a million dollars for a child with a rare genetic disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking friends and family for cash can be challenging for students from low-income families, however, because they tend not to move in well-heeled circles. And more affluent strangers may be hesitant to open their wallets because it's difficult to confirm the students' financial situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither GoFundMe nor Crowdrise independently verifies the claims made in profiles. Mr. Damphousse of GoFundMe says most donors are friends and families of the students and are familiar with the details of their lives. However, he wrote in an email, ''if we ever do receive a complaint, we will investigate accordingly.'' Mr. Wolfe of Crowdrise says fabricated stories haven't been an issue so far, but the site encourages donors to give to those they know personally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those kinds of factors led another education crowdfunding site, ScholarMatch, to take a different approach, said Diana Adamson, the site's executive director. The nonprofit, which aims to match donors with low-income and first-generation college students, initially allowed students to post their own profiles. But donors often wanted more details about the students, she said, and some were reluctant to make donations to individuals because donations directly to individuals generally aren't tax-deductible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now ScholarMatch vets applicants and verifies their eligibility, including financial details, and then posts their profiles on its website. Donors' funds are pooled into a single scholarship fund, which is distributed by ScholarMatch. Donors can't earmark their funds for a specific student, Ms. Adamson said, but the funds are directed to a student who best meets their preferences -- say, a Hispanic woman who wants to study medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site, which was founded by the author Dave Eggers, who serves on its board, currently offers its services only to students from the San Francisco area but will soon expand to Los Angeles and has national ambitions, Ms. Adamson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some questions about personal crowdfunding for college costs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Do crowdfunding sites charge a fee?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For-profit sites typically keep a percentage of donations as a fee, so you should read the site's rules for details. GoFundMe and Crowdrise, for instance, charge 5 percent, plus a processing fee of about 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; What if I don't meet my fund-raising goal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal fund-raising sites typically don't penalize individuals if they fall short of their targets; you receive the amount you raised, less the site's fee. Again, you should check details of the site's policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Will raising college money from crowdfunding affect my financial aid package?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possibly. Money received by crowdfunding should be taken into account when you fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or Fafsa, the form used to determine how much you and your family must contribute to the cost of your education, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Edvisors.com. The funds would most likely fall into the ''untaxed income'' category, he said, and could reduce your eligibility for some need-based aid. ''But most people probably aren't reporting it,'' he added. Receiving money through crowdsourcing could also have tax ramifications, so it's wise to consult a tax professional.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a certain sort of fan, the crowdfunding pitch was impossible to resist. Here was a chance, it announced, to support a documentary about the immortal saga of the legendary game that all but revolutionized modern life. No pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three filmmakers promised nothing less than the origin story of the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons, ''a cautionary tale of an empire built by friends and lost through betrayal, enmity, poor management, hubris and litigation,'' they wrote on their Kickstarter page in 2012. They planned to chronicle the bitter battle waged by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, the game's creators, over credit and royalties.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, they wrote: ''Imagine 'The Social Network' '' -- the box office hit about the tortuous story of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s founding -- ''but no one ends up rich.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the filmmakers saw a cautionary tale in the story of their shared passion, they failed to heed its lessons. More than $250,000 in Kickstarter pledges and two years later, there is no documentary, only broken friendships and a lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The director of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons: A Documentary'' has sued his former partners for embarking on another documentary on the same subject. Gaming conventions like GenCon (''The Best Four Days in Gaming'') and GaryCon (''a living memorial to E. Gary Gygax'') are abuzz with rumors of backstabbing and creative theft. Gathering around their tabletop games and in online forums, Dungeons &amp; Dragons fans are distraught.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every story has 20 sides,'' reads the tagline for the upstart second documentary, a reference to the 20-sided dice Dungeons &amp; Dragons players use to direct their tabletop fantasy narratives. So far, this one has two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began, of course, with a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Savini, 45, the director of the original documentary, and Andrew Pascal, now one of the producers of the upstart ''The Great Kingdom,'' were junior crew members on ''Law &amp; Order'' in the mid-1990s when Mr. Pascal asked Mr. Savini to play. Their group met a few times a year, even as Mr. Savini left television to work on documentaries like ''Salinger'' and ''The Central Park Five.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dungeons &amp; Dragons game involves user-created characters who interact in combat, diplomacy and other adventures, in encounters that can last several hours or even days. Mr. Savini plays as a fighter named Klaatu, after a phrase in the 1951 science fiction film ''The Day the Earth Stood Still.'' Mr. Pascal serves as Dungeonmaster, a kind of M.C. for gaming groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was during one session a few years ago, Mr. Savini said in an interview, that the two friends, who both live in Brooklyn, hatched the idea of a film about their hobby. Mr. Pascal remembers it differently: In an affidavit submitted in State <span class="companylink">Supreme Court</span> in Brooklyn, he wrote that he had heard about the game's history in late 2010 and floated the project to his friend James Sprattley, a cameraman based in Los Angeles. They approached Mr. Savini to direct it a few months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Savini, who struggled with dyslexia as a child, the wizards, elves and paladins of Dungeons &amp; Dragons had been a portal into the world of storytelling. For Mr. Pascal, it was his creative spark. ''I would not be a filmmaker if it weren't for D&amp;D. Plain and simple,'' he told an interviewer this year. (Mr. Sprattley was more of a ''noob,'' short for ''newbie,'' Mr. Pascal wrote in their first Kickstarter update.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many non-teenager circles, it is not quite the thing to admit that Dungeons &amp; Dragons changed your life. But the filmmakers spoke of their subject with enthusiasm approaching veneration. When Mr. Savini heard about the game's history, he said in their Kickstarter pitch video, ''There was a moment of awe, and then there was a moment of, 'Do I want to go any further? Would I break the illusion by looking into this game?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping to finish by this year, the game's 40th anniversary, they began hunting down all the relevant authorities: Mr. Gygax's relatives; game designers who had helped build Mr. Gygax's company, Tactical Studies Rules, which published the game's first set of voluminous rule books in 1974; and Dungeons &amp; Dragons historians, who argue that its major innovation -- individual role-playing -- made shinier successors like World of Warcraft and even websites like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and OkCupid possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as they prepared to raise funds through Kickstarter, however, tensions simmered. In June 2012, Mr. Pascal wrote in the affidavit, Mr. Savini ''accused James and me of trying to steal his movie after we, as part of our job, merely offered suggestions for a possible narrative for the film.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Savini followed up with a chilly email saying he had a rights dispute with collaborators on a previous film. ''So I know what it looks like,'' he wrote. ''All the warning signs showed up within a 24 hour period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Mr. Pascal wrote, the director kept refusing the producers' requests to see the footage. Mr. Savini acknowledged in an interview that ''there were definitely some issues between the two of us,'' but declined to say more about the dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pascal and Mr. Sprattley declined to comment, citing the continuing legal tussles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cash infusion failed to smooth things over. The Dungeons &amp; Dragons faithful had pledged more than $195,000 in exchange for rewards like an autographed copy of ''Beyond the Wall: Exploring George R. R. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' '' for $65 or more, and associate-producer credits for $1,000 or more. But by April 2013, Mr. Savini was asking for mediation, which failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the documentary languished, the two sides turned to lawyers to negotiate a settlement agreement that would leave Mr. Savini with creative control of the film while the others retained half ownership. But in January, Mr. Savini and his new partner, Cecily Tyler, discovered that his former partners were making their own film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pascal said in the affidavit that he had told Mr. Savini about their plans; Mr. Savini denies hearing any such thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon the breakaway filmmakers were contacting many of the people interviewed for the original documentary -- a move Mr. Savini argues sowed confusion among their interview subjects and financial backers, at best, and amounted to theft of the original film's proprietary assets, at worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pascal opened a new Kickstarter, referring to ''creative differences'' and promising a ''new direction.'' He even promoted the new film in a comment on the original documentary's Kickstarter page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews with gaming news sites, he and the new director of ''The Great Kingdom'' have said the story of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and its influence on contemporary culture -- the scope of the original documentary -- is too big for a two-hour film. Better, they say, to focus on the personalities who built it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the subtleties of Dungeons &amp; Dragons filmmaking appear lost on the judge, who last month granted Mr. Savini's request for an injunction ordering the ''Great Kingdom'' team to put their project on indefinite hold, ruling that as former partners in the original film, they had a fiduciary responsibility not to damage it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been demonstrated that completion of the partnership film is being undermined, and its commercial value potentially diluted, by defendants' solicitation of funding for, and advertising of, its competing film,'' wrote Justice Carolyn E. Demarest. The filmmakers filed an appeal last month, and the two sides have entered settlement negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit has pitted fan against fan, with some outraged at the second film's very existence and others celebrating what they see as its more intimate focus. Still others have contributed to both, delighted at the prospect of even more Dungeons &amp; Dragons documentaries to watch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a place for so many documentaries on the subject, not just these two -- many,'' said Victoria Ricks Perren-Cserep, 34, whose father created a precursor to Dungeons &amp; Dragons with Mr. Gygax, who died in 2008. (She plays as a cleric named Lady Victoria of Schwartzenbruin, the capital of Perrenland.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though she met with Mr. Savini about his film, she ultimately supported ''The Great Kingdom,'' starting a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> group called ''Are there really 20 sides?'' to express disgust with the lawsuit. In her view, the fight boils down to ''one person's ego trying to squash'' the ''more personal, and better'' film from being made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons creators of her father's generation, she said, are not getting younger, and deserve to have their stories told: ''They're dying, these guys,'' she said, ''and to lose that and those interviews is just a travesty to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Savini and Ms. Tyler, who hope to finish their film by December, have hastened to assure the community that they, too, would love to see more films on the game. They rejected the suggestion that their situation had any parallel to the fights that cleaved Mr. Arneson from Mr. Gygax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you use the word 'curse,' people will jump on you for it. 'There is no curse!' '' said Ms. Perren-Cserep. ''But there is. They were all best friends suing each other 40 years ago, and this is parallel. It's very sad.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, two young companies that work in this sector are teaming up to offer start-up financing deals to a broad base of investors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SeedInvest, a so-called crowdfunding site that opened last year, announced on Thursday that it would partner with Gust, a 10-year-old network that includes thousands of angel investors, in an effort to expand its reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is intended to let each company benefit from the other's strengths. In addition to helping investors find start-ups that are seeking financing, SeedInvest provides a way to close investment deals online. Gust does not offer this function, but it has a far larger network of angel investors and start-ups around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only ''accredited'' investors -- those with a net worth above $1 million, not including their primary home, or with income over $200,000 in each of the preceding two years -- are legally allowed to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such an arrangement is possible because of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which lifted a restriction on advertising by companies seeking capital. Now, start-ups that want to raise financing can get the word out widely, though they must accept capital only from investors who are accredited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SeedInvest, which has helped about 20 start-ups raise financing, works with an outside broker-dealer to collect placement fees from companies that successfully raise capital through the site. Investors are not charged any fees to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SeedInvest says it has about 5,000 accredited investors in its network. Gust, meanwhile, says it includes more than 50,000 investors, who use the platform to find start-ups and build relationships, sometimes consummating deals offline.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT -- A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment fell more than expected on Wednesday to its lowest level since 2012, intensifying worries that the eurozone's largest economy is at risk of slipping into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stalwart German economy has anchored the rest of the eurozone during four years of intermittent crisis and uneven growth. Any pause in German growth spells trouble for countries like France and Italy, which depend heavily on trade with Germany, and are in much worse shape economically.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German economy already suffered a decline in the second quarter, when output fell 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter. Another consecutive quarterly decline would put the country into recession, according to a popular definition of the term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The eurozone's biggest economy has reached a dangerous stage between soft spell and longer-lasting almost-stagnation,'' Carsten Brzeski, an economist at <span class="companylink">ING Bank</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey by the <span class="companylink">Ifo Institute</span> in Munich showed that its business climate index, a composite of managers' expectations for the future and their assessment of the current situation, fell to 104.7 in September, from 106.3 in August, the lowest level since April 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the survey, expectations for business in the next six months hit their lowest reading since December 2012, falling to 99.3, from 101.7 in August. The survey of about 7,000 managers measures sentiment compared with 2005, when the index was set at 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The German economy is no longer running smoothly,'' Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ifo survey is the latest warning of flagging economic output in the eurozone, which has yet to recover to levels seen before the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. On Tuesday, a survey of purchasing managers in the eurozone by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, also signaled slowing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told members of the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> in Brussels that ''the economic recovery in the euro area is losing momentum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German economy has suffered from turmoil in Ukraine, which has unsettled consumers and businesses and made them hesitant to spend. The sanctions that the West imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, which added to existing weakness in the Russian economy, has sapped demand and weakened the ruble. In addition, German exports have been hit by sluggish growth in the rest of the eurozone and weak demand from developing countries like China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been talk in Berlin of stepping up spending on infrastructure such as autobahns or university campuses, but the government led by Angela Merkel has shown little appetite for immense fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister, has expressed pride that the government will not need to borrow money next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each new sign of flagging growth raises expectations that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will soon resort to large-scale purchases of government bonds, the same so-called quantitative easing used by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to spur growth in the United States. Economists at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span>, among others, expect the central bank to begin quantitative easing early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, other economists doubt that the central bank is ready to risk alienating Germany, where many people regard government bond purchases by the central bank as a de facto transfer of wealth from richer European countries to poorer ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The E.C.B. is ready to do everything but buy government bonds,'' Joachim Fels, chief global economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, told reporters here on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists do not expect the central bank to announce plans to buy government bonds at its next meeting, on Oct. 2. The central bank has already said it would buy private sector debt, beginning next month, and was expected to provide details next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists consider fears of another eurozone recession overblown. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, noted that the United States economy also sputtered several times before regaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not uncommon during a recovery to have temporary pauses,'' Mr. Paulsen said in an interview last week. Referring to the eurozone economy, he added, ''What's been happening in recent months looks very familiar to me.''</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such a vital connection with the audience is mostly missing from ''Gaïa Global Circus,'' a thoughtful climate-change play by Pierre Daubigny, performed almost entirely in French with English supertitles at the Kitchen, where it is presented with the Brown Institute of the <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Produced by Compagnie AccenT and Soif Compagnie, the play was conceived by the French philosopher Bruno Latour, who has long engaged with environmental dilemmas. Billed as the centerpiece of four days of Latour events at Columbia this week, the play takes aim at a problem he has described as the ''abysmal distance between our little selfish human worries and the great questions of ecology'': our failure to feel much of anything in the face of the climate crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a series of vignettes performed beneath a billowing, floating canopy (by Olivier Vallet), ''Gaïa Global Circus'' wants to rouse us from our collective shrug. It attempts this in part by invoking figures from mythology, like the Greek goddess Gaïa, who personifies the Earth, and Cassandra, the prophet whose curse was that she would not be believed. Climate scientists, the play suggests, are similarly spurned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dialogue-heavy production, directed by Frédérique Aït-Touati and the philosopher's daughter, Chloé Latour, is stymied by a design problem. Instead of watching the play, non-Francophone spectators must direct their attention to one of two small monitors off to either side of the stage to read supertitles that often translate only a bit of what's being said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday night, the disconnect was palpable. The fine, hardworking cast of four and its attentive audience were caught, most of the time, on opposite sides of a language barrier, which was in turn an impediment to emotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most successful moments tend to be wordless, or nearly so: When people begin to riot in a scene of apocalyptic chaos that evokes Anne Washburn's ''Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play''; when a storm from what seems like the end of the world rumbles through and makes our bodies vibrate; when, at last, the floating canopy envelops us and we feel strangely safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another scene, too, in which a girl (Jade Collinet) speaks with adolescent passion about the Beatles song ''She's Leaving Home.'' As it plays, she addresses us in English, and the moment is completely alive, a tender reminder of what is sweet about each new generation. It does what the play intends: calls to mind in a visceral way why we need to keep this home of ours healthy.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comptroller Scott M. Stringer unveiled a letter-grading system on Wednesday that rates New York City agencies in terms of their spending on goods and services provided by businesses owned by women and minorities. Over all, the inaugural report card gave the city a D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 32 agencies examined, none got an A, and only the Department of Cultural Affairs and Landmarks Preservation Commission earned B's.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We looked at ourselves as well,'' Mr. Stringer said during a news conference at his office, ''and we got a C.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just as letter grades raised public health standards,'' he added, ''it is our hope that these grades will change the conversation about city procurement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 3.9 percent of the city's $17.8 billion procurement budget went to minority- and women-owned firms in the 2014 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, up from 2.7 percent the previous year, but well off the 5 percent high achieved in the 2012 fiscal year. The participation of such firms in city contracts falls far short of goals set by Local Law 1, which went into effect last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has certified about 3,800 minority- and women-owned business enterprises, or M.W.B.E.s, since 2007, but they are not getting city contracts in substantial numbers, Mr. Stringer said. ''I don't think we have mentored these firms,'' he said. ''I don't think we spent the time within the agencies getting them into meetings where they can compete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at an unrelated news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio described the report as ''another example of taking primarily older data and assessing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor said that since he took office, the city had certified 641 such businesses. ''We are very confident you're going to see a sea change when it comes to the approach to M.W.B.E. compared to not just the previous administration,'' but to ''the previous two administrations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city awarded a record $420 million in prime contracts to such firms this fiscal year, Marti Adams, a mayoral spokeswoman, said, adding that the administration was eager to include such firms in its Hurricane Sandy recovery program. Ms. Adams also noted that the mayor had chosen his counsel, Maya Wiley, to serve as M.W.B.E. director to ensure compliance with the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two offices also argued on Wednesday about compliance issues on a different front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While answering questions after he unveiled the grading system, Mr. Stringer addressed the executive order Mr. de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, signed on Tuesday that expands the city's living wage law and raises the hourly wage to $13.13, from $11.90, for workers who do not get benefits. The mayor chose the Department of Consumer Affairs to oversee compliance; Mr. Stringer said that usurped his authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're taking that authority to investigate and putting it into a mayoral agency with no history or track record of doing this work,'' Mr. Stringer said. ''And in the middle of the night, you issue an executive order, you don't tell anybody about it, and then you think that's O.K. Well, I'm here to tell you something. We're going to do our job.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reacting to a Stringer aide's message about the order, posted on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, the mayor's aides replied that he had announced plans for the executive order at his State of the City address in February, and was required by law to pick an agency to work with the comptroller's office.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he vetoed a bill this week that would have strengthened the legal rights of franchisees in dealings with their corporate owners, Gov. Jerry Brown of California condoned an economic status quo that squeezes small businesses and low-wage workers even as corporate profits rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, he did not put it that way. In a statement explaining his veto, the governor echoed the bill's mainly Republican opponents, saying there was inadequate evidence of unacceptable or predatory practices by corporate franchisers to warrant a new law.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That assertion, however, ignores ample evidence of just such practices. Even before the California Legislature took up the issue, developments in contract and antitrust law over nearly 20 years had given corporations ever more control over franchisees. In the last two years, California lawmakers in multiple committees heard extensive testimony from both sides of the issue, which was openly debated in the Legislature in addition to being the subject of press coverage and heavy lobbying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture that emerged is one in which many if not most corporate franchise agreements extract heavy fees, royalties and other payments, while leaving franchisees with little if any say over business operations and, by extension, how much they can afford to pay their workers. At a hearing last June, a <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> franchisee who supported the bill told legislators that corporate overseers had told her that she was paying employees ''too much,'' and that she could make more money -- for herself and the corporation -- by paying them less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California bill -- by giving franchisees a bigger say in the operation, closure, sale and transfer of their businesses -- would have been an improvement. It also would have propelled change elsewhere, because California is so big and influential. Still, change will come, if for no other reason than that the current hardships inflicted on small businesses and hourly workers are untenable. The questions are when change will come and from where.</p>
