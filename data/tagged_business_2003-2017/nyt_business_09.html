<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- <span class="companylink">The Louvre</span> kicked off its latest crowd-funding campaign on Tuesday with an appeal for a million euros to help fund the €12.5 million purchase of a jeweled piece of 18th-century furniture, known as the ''Table of Peace,'' which belonged to a French diplomat who negotiated the end of a Bavarian war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two years of budget cuts in state aid for cultural institutions, the Louvre is the second major French museum to turn to Internet fund-raising this month to pay for projects and acquisitions. For the first time, the <span class="companylink">Musée d'Orsay</span> last week called for €30,000, or about $37,600, in contributions to help finance the €600,000 restoration of Gustave Courbet's enormous painting of his studio, ''L'Atelier du peintre.'' By Tuesday, it had collected more than €20,000.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other major institutions like the National Library of France are also trying crowd-funding as an alternative. In August, it issued a public appeal for aid to acquire a €2.4 million illuminated manuscript that represents the first emperors of Rome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But among those institutions, the Louvre has the most crowd-funding experience. Since 2010, it has received more than €4 million from almost 20,000 donors for acquisitions of a medieval painting and ivory statuettes, and the restoration of the museum's ''Winged Victory of Samothrace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday at the Louvre, its new president, Jean-Luc Martinez, unveiled the neo-Classical table -- studded with agates, opals and quartz -- and characterized it as a one-of-a-kind work of art with its own literary and geopolitical history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work is known as the ''Table of Peace'' because it was given to the French diplomat Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, known as Baron de Breteuil, as thanks for his efforts to negotiate an end to the War of the Bavarian Succession that started in 1778. It also figures in Marcel Proust's ''Swann's Way.'' Until now, the table has remained with the descendants of the baron in the family castle about 25 miles west of Paris.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Intuit</span> is well known for QuickBooks, its small-business accounting software, which has 1.4 million users. Those users have helped <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> amass an enormous amount of financial data about the costs of starting and running a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the company launched the Startup Financial Planner, a financial planning tool that integrates <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>'s small-business data and is designed to help entrepreneurs calculate the cost of starting and running a business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planner was developed for <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> by DigitalRelevance, a content marketing firm in Indianapolis. Users access the tool from the QuickBooks website and follow the prompts to describe the kind of business they want to build or currently have, including the location and legal structure of the business. The program then takes entrepreneurs through a series of questions about their business and a wide variety of potential expenses. They can either use the auto fill answers from <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> or overwrite the space and fill in their own answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jenny <span class="companylink">Brown</span>, a content strategist at DigitalRelevance, said the goal was to provide a very solid estimate of the total costs to start and run a business. ''The tool basically thinks of all the costs an aspiring entrepreneur may not have anticipated,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The user enters all the requested information and receives a downloadable financial analysis, including first-year expenses, a projected break-even analysis (including in what month the start-up can expect to break even), business trend comparisons and licensing and permit needs. While entering information, entrepreneurs can learn more about the topics being covered by clicking on related articles and infographics -- reviewing, for instance, the pros and cons of various corporate structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business trend comparison data, Ms. Brown said, can be especially useful to a start-up: ''After you have your financial estimates, it will show you by category how your estimates compare to actual businesses that meet the same criteria as yours, like your location, legal structure, number of employees, etc.'' Users can see, for example, how the amount of money they have allocated toward advertising, payroll, rent or travel compares to what the average business of their size and in their category has spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Startup Financial Planner is free and users are anonymous to <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, said John Schulenburg, who heads search engine optimization and content marketing for <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>'s small-business group. Users don't have to provide an email and can get an identification number that will allow them to stop, save their work and return at another time to finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3,000 people have used the tool thus far and Mr. Schulenburg said <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> planned to create more tools that can be used at various points throughout the life cycle of a small business. <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> isn't looking to make money on them, he said, its part of a desire to rebrand QuickBooks as more than just accounting software. ''We want to connect with customers and prospects around everything that relates to their small-business life cycle,'' Mr. Schulenburg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the Startup Financial Planner does take some time. Depending on how knowledgeable users are and how much information they have to input, completing the questions can take a few hours. That may sound exhausting or intimidating, but it may save entrepreneurs considerable anguish in the long run. ''It's better for them to feel some pain at that point, when they are trying to get their heads around the planning and the process,'' Ms. Brown said, rather than after they have already taken the plunge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average climbed back above 17,000, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index approached its nominal record closing high.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market rose from the start of trading, then built on the momentum as investors were encouraged by the latest earnings reports. <span class="companylink">Whirlpool</span>, <span class="companylink">AutoNation</span> and the engine maker Cummins all rose nearly 7 percent after reporting quarterly results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Tuesday's gain, the market has recovered almost all of the ground it lost in a four-week slide through Oct. 15, when the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index closed just short of a correction, or a drop of 10 percent from its previous high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here we are just two weeks later, and we've just about gained it back,'' said Scott Wren, a stock strategist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Advisors</span>. ''We think it's still going up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were encouraged by news that a key gauge of consumer confidence rebounded strongly in October. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported that its confidence index hit a seven-year high of 94.5 in October, up from 89 in September, as solid job gains raised expectations for economic growth, a positive sign for retailers on the eve of the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Confidence is good, and we're predicting Christmas is going to be very strong,'' said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist at <span class="companylink">Federated Investors</span>. ''Stocks are cheap right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 rose 23.42 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,985.05. That puts it just 26.31 points short of its Sept. 18 nominal record close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 10 industry groups in the index rose, led by a 2.3 percent gain in energy stocks because of an increase in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average rose 187.81 points, or 1.1 percent, to 17,005.75, its first close above 17,000 since Oct. 3.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, orders to companies for long-lasting manufactured goods fell for a second month in September, a government report showed. Orders for durable goods retreated 1.3 percent in September after a 18.3 percent tumble in August. Orders have fluctuated in recent months because of moves in aircraft orders, a volatile category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose in August, albeit at a more modest pace. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.6 percent in August from 12 months earlier. That is down from a 6.7 percent increase in July and the smallest gain since November 2012. Home prices were rising at a double-digit pace as recently as last fall. <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span> rose 84 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $38.60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are looking to Wednesday's announcement by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s policy making committee for insight into when the central bank might start raising interest rates. As the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> winds down its $4 trillion bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, concern is heightening about whether the nation's economy is strong enough to sustain growth without that support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the stocks on the move, <span class="companylink">Amgen</span> rose $8.99, or 6 percent, to $157.19 after it announced plans to cut more jobs, buy back $2 billion worth of stock and raise its dividend by 30 percent. That followed news Monday that third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue for <span class="companylink">Amgen</span>, the world's biggest biotech drug manufacturer, had topped Wall Street's expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Madison Square Garden Company</span> surged $7.21, or 11 percent, to $72.99 after it said it was considering splitting its entertainment businesses from its media and sports divisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, the social media network, plummeted $4.78, or 10 percent, to $43.78 after reporting meager growth in the number of its users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kohl's</span> was the biggest loser in the S.&amp;P. 500, falling $3.89, or 6.6 percent, to $54.66. The retailer predicted its annual profit would be at the low end of its forecast, partly because of slower sales in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of oil rose as increasing consumer confidence led investors to anticipate greater demand for energy. Crude oil for December delivery rose 42 cents to settle at $81.42 a barrel in New York. Crude has dropped sharply since June, when it went as high as $107 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent crude rose 20 cents to $86.03 a barrel in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note rose to 2.30 percent from 2.26 percent late Monday, while its price dropped 12/32, to 100 21/32.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has discovered a number of defects in the online marketplace that will offer health insurance to millions of small-business employees, but federal officials said the problems could probably be fixed before the website goes live on Nov. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The website, for businesses with 50 or fewer employees, was created by the Affordable Care Act and was supposed to open Oct. 1, 2013, but officials could not meet that deadline. Since then, they have been trying to build the site.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testing began last week in Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey and Ohio, just days after federal officials gave experts in the industry a preview at a White House meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners, employees, insurers and insurance agents welcomed the website for the Small Business Health Options Program, known as the SHOP exchange, but said they had found defects that needed to be corrected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, they said, some health insurance plans approved for sale on the exchange did not show up on the website. The site worked well with some web browsers, like Chrome, but not with others, like Internet Explorer and Firefox. Premiums and other charges for some plans were erroneously displayed as percentages rather than dollar amounts -- 350 percent rather than $350, for example. For some households, the principal subscriber was listed as a dependent, or vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials said they were working around the clock to fix the problems, and they have apologized to insurers whose plans were not loaded onto the website. They expressed confidence that the small-business exchange, like a new portal for individual consumers, would be ready for its nationwide debut on Nov. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Janice Hahn of California, the senior Democrat on the health care panel of the <span class="companylink">House Small Business Committee</span>, said she hoped the administration was right. ''We can't afford another bad rollout,'' she said, recalling the problems that plagued HealthCare.gov last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rhett Buttle, the director of private-sector engagement at the Department of Health and Human Services, said small businesses in the five states where testing had begun could establish SHOP exchange accounts, choose agents to handle their accounts, apply for coverage online and upload lists of their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Contreras-Sweet, the new administrator of the United States Small Business Administration, emphasized the importance of the effort. ''Health care remains a top concern for small-business owners across the country,'' she said. People who work for small businesses are less likely to have insurance than people at large companies, and they typically pay more for the same or similar coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SHOP program promised affordable new insurance options, but it got off to a slow start, in part because officials were preoccupied with the individual marketplace. California signed up 1.4 million people through its individual exchange, but its small-business exchange enrolled only 1,700 companies, with 11,500 employees and dependents. In Minnesota, the small-business exchange signed up 190 employers covering 1,500 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The range of ''employee choice'' varies from state to state, even among states using the federal exchange. In some states, employers can select a level of coverage -- bronze, silver, gold or platinum -- and allow employees to choose any plan from any insurance company in that category. The different ''metal levels'' reflect the generosity of coverage: the percentage of costs paid, on average, by a health plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What employers cannot do in the federal exchange is offer employees a choice of levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be really nice if we could offer plans from different metal levels,'' said Joseph A. Cerino, the owner of an Ohio company that makes adhesive products. Federal officials said that would be difficult to administer and could destabilize insurance markets if large numbers of sicker people enrolled in certain plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily Black Bremer, president of the Missouri Association of Health Underwriters, said she had run into difficulty using a special portal for agents and brokers with small-business clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tried it for myself,'' Ms. Bremer said. ''I could not get in with my user name and password. There was an authentication issue with my login that caused a glitch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicholas A. Moriello, the president of Health Insurance Associates in Newark, Del., praised the Obama administration for soliciting the views of agents and brokers. He said he hoped the new website would work as well in practice as it did in a demonstration at the White House on Oct. 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''unless a company qualifies for the small-business health care tax credit,'' he said, ''there is not really a big incentive for employers to go through the SHOP exchange, rather than buying insurance outside the exchange.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit is available to certain employers with fewer than 25 employees and average wages of less than $50,000 a year. Companies with fewer than 10 employees and wages averaging less than $25,000 will get the largest tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year, small businesses have been able to buy insurance through the federal exchange using paper applications. But administration officials said they did not know how many had done so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not the source of information as far as SHOP enrollment,'' said Mayra E. Alvarez, director of the state exchange group at the <span class="companylink">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</span>. ''We are working with insurers to get that information so that we can better understand the number of small businesses that enrolled in coverage through SHOP.''</p>

The campaign, which began Oct. 22 at crowdrise.com, raised over $31,000 by early Sunday. The experience, Mr. Spinello said by phone from Bloomington, Ill., has been ''mind boggling.''

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRUSSELS -- <span class="companylink">European Union</span> officials on Tuesday sharply lowered growth forecasts as member states like France, Germany and Italy showed weak economic performance, and as business confidence suffered from heightened geopolitical risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth is expected to be a meager 1.3 percent in the 28-member bloc this year, instead of the 1.6 percent predicted in the spring, said the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>, the union's executive arm. And the economy is not expected to get much better in 2015, when growth in Germany, the region's economic engine, is expected to grind down to about 1 percent.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The economic and employment situation is not improving fast enough,'' Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission vice president for jobs and growth, said in a statement accompanying the closely watched economic forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless there are additional signs of growth and job creation in the next five years, ''people could despair of the European project,'' Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said at a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery on the Continent continues to lag those in the United States and Britain. Over the next two years, annual growth in Britain is expected to be close to 3 percent, and the unemployment rate is projected to be 5.5 percent in 2016, according to the data released Tuesday. The unemployment rate in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> is not expected to fall below double digits, where it has been since 2012, until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomier outlook will most likely raise expectations for the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> to take additional steps to stimulate the economy, though economists said they did not expect policy makers to take action at a meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on Tuesday did not take into account how the European economy might get a boost from a 300 billion euro, or $375 billion, plan to invest public and private money into infrastructure projects. Jean-Claude Juncker, who took office this month as president of the European Commission, has pledged to present that package before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how much of an effect that would have on lackluster growth remains to be seen. The spending program is unlikely to ''change the whole world,'' Mr. Katainen said, but ''its contribution can be significant.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower forecasts, especially in the 18-nation euro area, where the commission cut its projection for growth this year to 0.8 percent from an earlier 1.2 percent, are a measure of how quickly optimism about a recovery has dissipated. France has failed to grow as hoped, and Italy struggles to make overhauls. There are also signs that the German economy is stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the more drastic downgrades for 2015, the commission lowered Germany's forecast for growth by nearly a full percentage point to 1.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the problems facing European economies like Germany is the prospect of a ''new cycle of sanctions and countersanctions'' related to the restrictions that the United States and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> imposed on Russia in retaliation for its role in the Ukraine crisis, and reciprocal moves by Moscow, <span class="companylink">European Union</span> officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tensions ''could pose a larger roadblock to European growth prospects than currently envisaged in the forecast,'' the officials said in a report accompanying the forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tensions might also ''have triggered a wait-and-see attitude among firms,'' the officials wrote in a section of the report that focused on Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany is expected to post growth of 1.3 percent this year, down from an earlier forecast of 1.8 percent. The French economy is expected to grow 0.3 percent this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Italy appeared to stand out as a poor performer: Its economy was predicted to shrink 0.4 percent this year compared with a forecast in May for growth of 0.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission also expressed concerns about inflation, which it said would remain very low this year and would not come close to the target of just under 2 percent anytime soon. It projected an annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With confidence indicators declining since midyear and now back to where they were at the end of 2013, and hard data pointing to very weak activity for the rest of the year, it is becoming harder to see the dent in the recovery as the result of temporary factors only,'' officials wrote in their report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission said it expected growth rates to improve somewhat in 2015, rising to 1.5 percent in the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and to 1.1 percent in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, weaker-than-expected growth this year is likely to make it much harder for countries like France and Italy to achieve the bloc's mandated targets to keep budget deficits and government debt in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France and Italy could face disciplinary action and steep fines if they fail to show that they are making sufficient effort to bring their economies in line with European budgetary rules. Mr. Katainen said those recommendations would be published by the end of this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the commission said, the most recent figures indicate a slow fading of the legacy of the sovereign debt crisis, with many member states still weighed down by high unemployment, high debt and low output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prompted Mr. Katainen, the commission vice president, to call on member states to agree on the €300 billion spending plan to bolster demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Accelerating investment is the linchpin of economic recovery,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany also ''can play a significant role stimulating the euro area and E.U. economy'' by saving less and spending more, Mr. Katainen said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Adams, who sells fireplaces in Indianapolis, is like many of the nation's small-business owners. As the cost of providing health benefits has climbed, he has struggled to afford coverage for his employees -- a problem the new health care law was designed, in part, to address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a year after the law's introduction of the insurance exchanges, provisions that were supposed to help small businesses offer employee health benefits are largely seen as a failure. And Mr. Adams, like many of his fellow business owners, is sending employees to the exchanges to buy their own coverage instead.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Smith, who runs the Great Arizona Puppet Theater in Phoenix, made a similar decision. Her business employs only a handful of people who need insurance, and she was able to offer only plans with high deductibles. She and her employees decided buying individual policies made the most sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone wanted to do it because our costs were too high,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the focus on the Affordable Care Act has been on whether individuals can find affordable coverage through the online marketplaces. But the law also had the goal of creating a robust insurance market for small businesses by making tax credits available to businesses that provide coverage and creating small-business exchanges where companies could more easily find low-cost plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small-business exchanges were barely functional in most states last year, and it remains to be seen whether the Obama administration will manage to stop the steady decline in the number of employers offering coverage to their workers. The administration is poised to try again when open enrollment begins on Nov. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials say they do not know how many small businesses signed up for coverage in the small-business exchanges, but the numbers are likely to be very small. In California, for example, only 12,000 people were enrolled through the state's small-business exchange, compared with more than a million who enrolled as individuals there. To date, few businesses have availed themselves of the tax credits available for purchasing coverage for low-wage workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no denying that the program got off to a slow start in the first year,'' said Linda J. Blumberg, a policy expert at the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span>. Federal officials were focused on making sure the individual marketplaces worked, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say it remains an open question whether the program, known as SHOP for Small-Business Health Options Program, will eventually work. ''I think it will take a number of years, if it succeeds,'' said Jon Gabel, a policy expert at NORC at the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>. There remains strong opposition from brokers and some insurers, he said, who view it as a threat to their existing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal officials say they are committed to making the small-business marketplaces work over the next few years; five states are offering businesses early access to the online exchanges this year. Officials say they are making the necessary technical fixes to allow for online enrollment this year since most employers were forced to fill out applications by hand. They also say they are working more closely with brokers and point to the fact that more insurers will be offering plans for 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of small businesses and their employees will have more health care options, increased purchasing power and tax credits worth up to 50 percent of the employer's premium contributions,'' said Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the United States Health and Human Services Department, in an emailed statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses with fewer than 50 employees are not required to provide coverage. In all, they employ 34 million people, and the smallest employers are increasingly dropping coverage. Only 44 percent of employers with three to nine workers now offer coverage, according to a September survey by the <span class="companylink">Kaiser Family Foundation</span>, down from 52 percent a decade ago. Unlike large employers, which typically pay a significant share of a worker's premiums, 14 percent of companies with fewer than 200 employees do not contribute at all. Most small employers ignored the exchange for 2014. Mr. Adams, for one, said he did not even consider buying insurance under the program. ''I don't know if Indiana had the option,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance companies and brokers say many small-business owners chose to re-enroll employees in existing plans, many of which did not comply with the law's new rules but allowed employers more time to evaluate their options. ''It wasn't what small employers were clamoring for,'' said Rick Allegretti, an executive with <span class="companylink">Health Care Service Corporation</span>, which offers nonprofit <span class="companylink">Blue Cross</span> plans in five states and sells plans through the small-business exchange. The insurer is also offering a private-exchange alternative where employers can consider establishing a group plan that can be paid for with pretax dollars but, separately, still have some employees go to the individual exchanges, a move that some critics say is contrary to the intent of the law. <span class="companylink">WellPoint</span>, one of the nation's largest insurers, says that it is seeing a significant decline in the number of the smallest businesses continuing to offer coverage. The company reported insuring 300,000 fewer people in small-group plans this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The move is occurring as we expected it to,'' said Ken Goulet, a senior executive with WellPoint, which has been seeing these employees buy individual coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark T. Bertolini, chief executive of Aetna, another large insurer, told analysts in July that although the company was not seeing ''a lot of dumping,'' he did not think the market was ''sustainable over the long term as small-group employers stop offering coverage.'' <span class="companylink">Aetna</span> recently teamed with Sam's Club, a unit of <span class="companylink">Walmart Stores</span>, to also offer a private exchange for small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the very smallest businesses, sending workers to the individual exchanges can make the most financial sense. ''You can't expect those people to continue to offer'' coverage, said Gary Claxton, an executive for the Kaiser foundation. While workers who are sent to the individual exchanges must buy their policies with after-tax dollars, he said, many qualify for federal subsidies that lower the cost of coverage enough so they can afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public small-business exchanges, however, are the only way employers can now avail themselves of the tax credits available, and a recent analysis of the plans by Mr. Gabel of NORC showed them to be less expensive, on average, than the ones available outside of the exchanges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some employers say they have clearly benefited. Robert S. Jaffe, president of Consensus Systems Technologies, in Shenorock, N.Y., was able to save about $32,000 by going through the exchanges to buy coverage for six employees. He chose Health Republic Insurance, a new co-op plan created under the law, for people who lived in the area. While he was initially concerned about the insurer, he says he was reassured by the care it gave a worker needing a liver transplant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some employers have been unimpressed with the options available through the marketplaces. ''What I see on the exchange is junk,'' said Bill Frerichs, the owner of Frerichs Freight Lines in Belleville, Ill., a trucking business. He opted to stay with the coverage he had from <span class="companylink">Coventry Health Care</span>, owned by <span class="companylink">Aetna</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even some of those who have taken advantage of the law to continue providing coverage say they worry about the future. Annie Grove, who along with her husband, Matt, owns Bagel Grove in Utica, N.Y., has about 20 employees, some of whom are covered under Medicaid. She offers a high-deductible plan to six of them, including herself, and uses the tax credit to help pay for about half of the cost. Ms. Grove says she is still unsure how long she will be able to pay for coverage, especially when the tax credits expire after two years and she can no longer use the money for premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My biggest concern is when the tax credits go away,'' she said.</p>

The group has raised more than $2 million by crowd funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You saw that the need for cleaner oceans existed, and you came up with an idea of how to do it. Part of your plan involved leading a team of about a hundred expert volunteers and full-time staff. How does a 20-year-old prepare for that role?</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The project started with just me, myself and I. And then all these people joined me and they shared this vision of trying to develop this technology to clean the oceans. The point from where I was alone to where we had five or six people, that's a crucial aspect of leadership -- that you can communicate your vision and let them also do what you had in mind. The most important tool for that is just being extremely genuine and enthusiastic about what you would like to see being done. I think that the most crucial thing is to just have them focusing on the same goal that you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Given your age, how do manage these older, more experienced experts without bruising egos?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Actually, that has worked surprisingly well. I notice quite often that they don't really realize that I'm 20 years old. For example, we wanted to potentially hire someone who was 28 or something, and I was a bit doubtful of that decision. And then my colleagues mentioned: ''He's young, he can learn.'' And I thought, to me he is actually pretty old, so I don't know if his youth is a great argument. But somehow I've never really noticed my age being an obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is leadership learned, or are you born with it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I think a lot of it is learned. But some people are better at quickly learning it than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I don't think is acquired is the fact that I am naturally curious and I always wanted to see things be created. I never planned to be a manager or anything, it's just that there was a necessity to do that in order for my goals to be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You are also responsible for firing people or not renewing their contracts. Is that difficult for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes. And that's really something that I never really signed up for, but it is part of my responsibilities. I intended to start this organization just by developing the technology, and that would be that, but all these things came with it that I wasn't fully prepared for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's perhaps one thing that's even more difficult than firing people that work for you on a paid basis, and that is letting go of volunteers. You have to be very careful, because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings. A huge part of the success of our organization comes from the volunteers. You don't want to make enemies with people who initially came out to help your cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How do you keep people motivated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are so focused on delivering and working on a goal, that sometimes you forget about maintaining the people you are working with. On the other hand, we are in the very lucky position that everyone wants to have clean oceans, and for the people with us that's especially true, so we can kind of get away with being a bit passive about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Because of your organization's growing popularity, you now get a lot of people who want to work with you. How important is it to differentiate between passion and skills when recruiting volunteers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's extremely important. There are indeed a lot of people now who really want to help but lack the expertise. When I stared this project I was a first-year-student [at <span class="companylink">Delft University of Technology</span>], so I'm not really an engineer or anything, and the first people I attracted were engineers and scientists. It's just incredibly important to get people around you that do things better than you would, because otherwise you start to interfere in their work, you start to try to improve their work -- which is exactly the opposite way of how things should be going. I'm not an expert in everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Given that many of your experts are based in places quite a distance from the office, how to keep everyone feeling like a team?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The head of oceanography lives in Australia and the coordinator of the maritime law topics is in Canada, and I think I've never personally met about a third of the team. But it doesn't really feel like that; it feels like you are working with them on a day-to-day basis. Thanks to video conferencing, we are really well connected. We also let them be part of the team meetings. They constantly get updated, so digital communications are really important there. It's very doable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Most people with ambitions like yours would first study, then gather experience and expertise. How were you able to skip all those steps and coordinate a such a big project?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I thought it was a really urgent, pressing thing. I was just constantly thinking about it. I gave myself half a year to see if I could get it off the ground and that sort of worked out. That was the ''pull factor'' toward a project like this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ''push factor'' away from studies is that what you learn in university makes you an expert in a very small aspect of something. And when you want to lead a project like this, you have to know something about basically every aspect of the project. So you have to know a bit about human resources, a bit about engineering, a bit about finance -- especially with the problems of today that are really complex and interdisciplinary. It's something that university can't really prepare you for. It's not a good preparation if you want to be an entrepreneur working on a global issue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over 21,800 backers contributed to the appeal from the public media company PRX to fund its podcast network Radiotopia, which includes programs from Roman Mars (''99% Invisible''), the Kitchen Sisters (''Fugitive Waves'') and Joe Richman (''Radio Diaries''), among others.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful appeal comes as new attention is being focused on podcasts, after the popularity this fall of ''Serial,'' which takes listeners inside the journalist Sarah Koenig's investigation into a 1999 murder. The weekly podcast, which is at the top of Apple's iTunes podcast list, comes from the creators of the public radio mainstay ''This American Life'' and is produced by WBEZ Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radio journalist Alex Blumberg, a ''This American Life'' veteran and co-founder of ''Planet Money,'' is also raising funds for a new commercial podcasting network and documenting the process in his own podcast called ''StartUp.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade after podcasting began, the medium's audience, distribution, revenue and content are finally coming together, said Jake Shapiro, the chief executive of PRX. ''All of us are feeling like we're at the beginning of a flourishing new ecosystem around podcasts,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has these really important roots in public radio but the shape of it is a new system,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiotopia has focused on voices and formats that do not always find a place on traditional public radio. The Kickstarter money will support new episodes of its existing podcasts, as well as subsidized health care and raises for the staff of ''99% Invisible,'' Radiotopia's lead program, which looks at architecture and design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four new podcasts will also join the network, three of them hosted by women. The lack of female voices in podcasting has been ''a gap,'' Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was very important to help address that in Radiotopia,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A portion of the money will also go to a pilot development fund to find new podcast producers and hosts. ''We want to be another bridge to rising talent,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''It's a leap of faith to commit to doing your own show.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sirius XM and <span class="companylink">Pandora Media</span> have both been hit in the last year by a series of lawsuits over old recordings. Neither company pays record labels or performing artists on songs recorded before 1972, when federal copyright protection was first applied to recordings. (Both services, however, pay separate royalties for songwriting.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, members of the 1960s band the Turtles -- who sang hits like ''Happy Together'' and ''She'd Rather Be With Me'' -- sued Sirius XM in California, New York and Florida, saying that by playing its songs without permission, the broadcaster had infringed on the group's rights under state laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Turtles sought class-action status and asked for $100 million in damages. But these cases may well have broader implications if they lead to changes in copyright law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court in Manhattan rejected Sirius XM's motion for summary judgment, saying the Turtles have performing rights to their recordings under New York State law. Sirius XM has until Dec. 5 to dispute remaining facts in the case, the judge wrote, otherwise Sirius XM will be ruled liable for infringement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In short, general principles of common law copyright dictate that public performance rights in pre-1972 sound recordings do exist,'' Judge McMahon wrote. A representative of Sirius XM declined on Sunday to comment on the decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ruling comes after a separate win for the Turtles in September, when a federal judge in California found Sirius XM liable for infringement under state laws there. That decision was viewed as a major victory for artists and record companies, although its wider impact was unclear because it applied only to California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge McMahon's decision bolstered the music industry's position that old recordings are covered under state laws. But both recording and broadcasting executives say the potential for wide confusion over music licensing -- for example, it may mean that thousands of AM-FM radio stations, as well as restaurants or sports arenas where music is performed, may have been infringing on recording rights for decades -- may require clarification from Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cases also come as record sales have continued to decline and the music industry has become more reliant on income from online and streaming audio services. SoundExchange, a nonprofit organization that collects recording royalties from Internet and satellite radio, estimates that about $60 million is lost each year in uncollected royalties from oldies.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> dawdles, states are rushing to adopt their own crowdfunding rules. Ironically, it may just be the thing that rescues crowdfunding from a regulatory death grip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act, otherwise known as the JOBS Act. The law was an odd creature. It purported to open up the capital markets and create jobs by loosening regulations on initial public offerings and allowing for crowdfunding. Yet there was little evidence to support that watering down of any of these regulations would create jobs. Instead, the bill mainly appeared to be catering to special interests and was intended to show that Congress was doing something, anything, to create jobs. Crowdfunding in particular was pushed by a number of special interests that -- you guessed it -- wanted to start crowdfunding sites.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding was also the most controversial part of the bill. The S.E.C., led by Mary Schapiro at the time, submitted a letter in opposition. The reason was basically fraud. Let's face it, in a world where a potato salad party can raise more than $50,000 on Kickstarter, people may not be investigating their investments particularly well. The S.E.C. feared that crowdfunding would instead serve as an easy vehicle to defraud people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More important perhaps was the idea that these investments would create zombie companies -- companies that weren't frauds but that investors simply couldn't get profit from. The S.E.C.'s protests led to some last-minute revisions to the bill, including a requirement that a crowdfunding company include audited financials when raising more than $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress gave the S.E.C. a deadline of December 2012 to enact the new rules. For those keeping score, that was almost two years ago. But the S.E.C. has flouted that deadline and has yet to give a green light to crowdfunding. Its only action thus far was to issue proposed rules about a year ago. Hundreds of comments later, and nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some who think that crowdfunding is an invitation to fraud, this is the best outcome, for the S.E.C. to simply ignore the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the crowdfunding industry is eager for guidelines. And so it has started to go to the states to work around the S.E.C.'s inertia. Under the securities laws, an offering made in a state by company from that state is exempt from the S.E.C. rules on securities offerings. This was intentional when the Securities Act of 1933 was passed. The idea was that individual states should maintain jurisdiction of offerings limited to their borders because only their residents would be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with this exemption, 13 states have so far enacted crowdfunding rules. As might be expected, these states have different approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C. has been focused on minimizing fraud and has pushed for strict requirements, including that issuers prepare and file with the agency audited financials and extensive disclosure. But with the S.E.C. dragging its feet on approving the rules, national crowdfunding has stalled. In the meantime, the S.E.C. has been actively bringing litigation to shut down crowdfunding platforms that are operating despite the lack of rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For good or bad, the states don't seem to care as much about the fraud issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Texas, which last month proposed its own crowdfunding rules that are deliberately more liberal than those proposed by the S.E.C. The Texas rules require no audited financials and no extensive disclosure. Instead, a Texas company can raise up to $1 million in any 12-month period, and it only has to do so through a privately run portal that vets the companies. And unlike the S.E.C.'s proposed rules, there are no annual filing requirements. Michigan, Indiana and other states that have adopted their own crowdfunding rules have similarly relaxed requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed S.E.C. rules, particularly those requiring audited financials and annual reporting, have been criticized as detrimental to crowdfunding because compliance costs have been estimated to consume more than 15 percent of the offering. The result is that few expect the S.E.C. to adopt regulations that allow companies to use crowdfunding effectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the S.E.C. acted in a timely fashion, it would have ended the matter because its rules would have effectively pre-empted the states from acting. But the S.E.C.'s delay has given states room to offer more viable alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some states are resisting the push. Florida's crowdfunding legislation died after the state's financial regulator opposed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states that are filling the void are undertaking the great experiment that Congress should have required in the first place. Instead of ordering the S.E.C. to adopt crowdfunding rules as it did, Congress should have instead allowed for the S.E.C. to undertake a small-scale campaign to see what worked and what did not. Instead, Congress ordered the S.E.C. to adopt strict crowdfunding rules, while the agency has resisted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states themselves have decided to take up the experiment. Because of state crowdfunding laws, sites now exist like CraftFund in Wisconsin, which says it was instrumental in passing the state's crowdfunding statute. It specializes in funding food and drink companies but seems partial to craft breweries. CraftFund started in Wisconsin for its residents to invest in Wisconsin companies, but it appears to be expanding to start-ups in other states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another site is LocalStake, an Indiana-based site that has about 50 potential investments listed, including a number of -- you guessed it -- craft beer companies. But there is also <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Butcher shop, which raised $220,000 from 24 people and is the only ''farm to fork'' local food purveyor in Central Indiana, as well as a student loan company and a few other ''tech'' companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there hasn't exactly been a crowdfunding stampede in these states yet. This is crowdfunding in its glory -- about buzzy ideas that get attention or loyalty but perhaps don't succeed. In this world, craft beer seems to be the sine qua non of fund-raising. Who doesn't want to invest in their own beer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that may be the good thing. Perhaps the S.E.C.'s concerns are overwrought and crowdfunding doesn't need the tighter regulation. Alternatively, perhaps crowdfunding is the refuge of fraudulent brewers. Either way, we're about to see which narrative of crowdfunding is true and whether crowdfunding can succeed, just in particular states. The S.E.C. has delayed on crowdfunding because it doesn't approve of it, but perhaps the S.E.C. should continue to wait simply to find out what works and doesn't in the more adventurous states.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. For the uninformed, could you explain the concept of crowdfunding?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Essentially, crowdfunding means a single-asset real estate fund that is open to accredited investors. It's online equity syndication for one specific project on a retail basis. That would be the simplest way of putting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't legal here in the United States until Sept. 23, 2013, through the JOBS Act. And it is only for accredited investors -- by definition, they have a net worth of $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or an income of $200,000 per year for the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You funded three buildings in New York that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Here in the States we focused only on projects in New York. We want to provide access to what we believe is the better real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is on 84 William Street; another one is on 46th Street, between Second and Third; and the third one is 17 John Street. They are all extended-stay apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Let's talk about these buildings, starting with the AKA projects, in partnership with Korman Communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. AKA Wall Street is under construction. We raised a total of $32 million, and we're getting $72 million from CIBC, the Canadian bank, and the balance in the form of mezzanine financing. We gut-renovated the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We closed on the property for AKA United Nations in September. We got $10 million from the crowd. We got senior financing from <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> -- I believe it was $55 million -- and the balance in the form of mezzanine loans. Construction is scheduled to commence in the first quarter, and it should be completed then because the building is there and there isn't that much renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We start selling condos in AKA Wall Street and <span class="companylink">United Nations</span> in February 2015. So we expect that by the end of that year we should be out of those two projects entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. And 17 John?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. For that one we raised coincidentally another $32 million to close on the property. That's from the crowd. We got a senior loan from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> -- and it's between $50 million and $60 million and another mezzanine piece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We intend to build a tower atop the existing building. And we're buying more air rights. It will be probably 30 stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we have 191 units scheduled before the additional air rights; with the additional air rights we'll be about 230 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of the condominiums will commence in September 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You crowdsourced for the design of 17 John, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes. Technology is really a way to harness the collective intelligence of the crowd in many respects. It was really helpful, because we got over 80 proposals from more than 22 countries. It doesn't apply everywhere. With AKA, they have very defined guidelines as to what the design of the properties should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's the minimum investment for that building?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If you are an American accredited investor, you can come in as low as $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We started in the first project, AKA Wall Street, with $250,000 tickets for the minimum, and then as our administrative capacity enhanced, we brought it down to $100,000, then $50,000. And now we're launching the second offering of 17 John with $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is there a maximum?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. You cannot invest more than $2 million. The largest investor so far came in with $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's the average amount that people invest in the New York projects?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. So far they have invested probably north of $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have had over 6,300 investors already that have contributed over $300 million in equity, and the average amount in total is around $80,000. That includes the projects that we do in Colombia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in New York we have raised over the last 12 months over $72 million in equity, with just north of 300 investors, because the tickets were larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What kinds of returns can investors expect?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're expecting returns north of 15 percent to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. So why the focus on extended-stay hotels, at least in New York?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There is not enough inventory on the smaller end. Everybody focused on the larger apartments, the luxury, and I think there is a huge demand for smaller apartments. These will be furnished. You can live in the unit throughout the year if you want and not put it in the rental program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I like the extended-stay play because it is safer in a number of ways. We take a very conservative approach with the exit strategy. So whatever we cannot sell for whatever reason, we can keep and operate them as extended-stays.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Obama administration nominated Antonio Weiss, a senior deal maker at <span class="companylink">Lazard</span>, for a high-level position at the Treasury Department, the move has drawn criticism from some unusual quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now the latest source of unhappiness comes from, of all places, community bankers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Independent Community Bankers of America, an industry group, wrote a letter to several senators on Wednesday that laid out the organization's problems with Mr. Weiss's appointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It follows planned opposition to Mr. Weiss from two prominent Democratic Senators: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has won favor from the party's liberal wing for her anti-Wall Street stance, and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the outgoing <span class="companylink">Senate</span> majority whip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss needs approval from <span class="companylink">the Senate</span> to join the Treasury Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Criticism of the nomination of Mr. Weiss, the global head of investment banking at <span class="companylink">Lazard</span> and a significant donor to Democratic candidates, to be the Treasury Department's under secretary for domestic finance boils down to a number of points. One is Mr. Weiss's work on <span class="companylink">Burger King</span>'s acquisition of the Canadian coffee chain <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span>, which was a corporate inversion that relocated the fast food empire's corporate home to Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to news reports, several lawmakers -- including Ms. Warren and Mr. Durbin -- have indicated at the least some level of discomfort with Mr. Weiss's <span class="companylink">Burger King</span> assignment. Corporate inversions have become a significant target of the Obama administration, which has criticized the actions of several major companies to give up their American corporate citizenship to reduce their tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the Treasury Department unveiled new measures aimed at reducing inversions' economic attractiveness several months ago, killing off the plans of the drug maker <span class="companylink">AbbVie</span> to take over the Dublin-based Shire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Weiss's experience in inversions appears limited to the <span class="companylink">Burger King</span> deal. He did not advise the chain on the tax component of its <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> deal, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss the deal. And <span class="companylink">Burger King</span> has said repeatedly that its deal was not t motivated by a desire to shrink its tax bill. Indeed, it has said that the new company's tax rate is expected to go down only a few percentage points, and that it would still buy <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> even if tax rules were changed to make inversions less lucrative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lazard</span> itself has advised on only a few inversions so far this year, including Steris's takeover of Synergy Health, a deal in which the firm advised the buyer, and Horizon Pharma's acquisition of Irish counterpart <span class="companylink">Vidara Therapeutics</span>, in which the investment bank worked for the seller. It also advised the Irish-domiciled fruit producer <span class="companylink">Fyffes</span> in its since-canceled plans to merge with Chiquita.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one official within the Obama administration believes that Mr. Weiss will support the Treasury Department's moves to reduce the appeal of inversions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think certainly Mr. Weiss would support reforms in that regard because the net effect of that is to essentially use the inversion method to avoid taxation in the United States and that's not right,'' John Podesta, a counselor to the White House, told Bloomberg Television last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason to oppose Mr. Weiss that was cited by Ms. Warren and the community bankers group is his focus on mergers and acquisitions and international finance. Both have argued that such a professional background is too narrow for a Treasury post that includes negotiating with Congress over the federal government's borrowing limits, popularly known as the debt ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While Mr. Weiss has impressive credentials as a top Wall Street executive specializing in international mergers and acquisitions, Wall Street is already well represented at Treasury, and the narrow focus of Mr. Weiss's professional experience is a serious concern for I.C.B.A. and community banks nationwide,'' the community bankers' group wrote in its letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of Mr. Weiss's nomination would argue that the domestic finance post has an international component, given that many buyers of federal government debt are foreign investors, and that overall awareness of the international economy is important to the position. (Politico has heard much the same thing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the bankers group, anyone taking up the domestic finance position should also have a background near and dear to the group's heart: community banking. The organization's letter notes that it has called for the creation of an assistant secretary for community banking to have a say in the policy-making process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the absence of an assistant secretary for community banking, I.C.B.A. believes it is critical the under secretary for domestic finance possess a thorough understanding of community banking, preferably based on professional experience in that industry,'' the group wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesperson for the White House said in a statement, ''Antonio Weiss is a highly qualified nominee and we look forward to <span class="companylink">the Senate</span>'s consideration of his nomination and swift confirmation.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, many small businesses have been intrigued by the possibility that they might be able to stop dealing with health insurance entirely and instead offer their employees a stipend to go buy insurance on the individual exchanges. But in a clarification issued in early November, the federal government appears to have taken a stand against that strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There had been little doubt among most lawyers who follow the tax implications of the Affordable Care Act that a company would not be able to subsidize its employees' individual health insurance with pretax dollars (the way that premiums for group health insurance are excluded from an employee's income). But as we reported a few weeks ago, the government's guidance on using post-tax compensation was murkier. With its recent statement, the government removed some -- though not all -- of that ambiguity.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The additional clarity came in the form of a ''frequently asked questions'' document issued by the Department of Labor. Even now, however, the issues remain complex and open to interpretation, and the tax and benefits lawyers contacted by You're the Boss offered differing perspectives on the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span>'s answers. What better way to try to make sense of these issues than to borrow a trope from the government and present them in the form of an FAQ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, can a company reimburse workers for their insurance premiums with after-tax money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. Any reimbursement scheme constitutes a group health plan, according to the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span>. This designation is important, because the government had already decided that a group health plan must comply with certain market reforms in the Affordable Care Act, including one that bans dollar limits for certain benefits. And a plan that reimburses members for individual policies simply cannot comply with those requirements, according to the agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses with plans that violate the health law's market rules can face penalties of up to $36,500 a year for each affected employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until now, there had been a debate among lawyers about whether a company could expressly reimburse individual insurance premiums with taxable income, or, if not, condition the additional compensation on buying insurance -- even if the money is not tied directly to the cost of premiums. But the latest advice from the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> should end those arguments, according to four of five lawyers contacted by You're the Boss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we know now is that you can't condition the receipt of after-tax money only on the purchase of insurance,'' said Christopher E. Condeluci, a Washington-based lawyer. ''Instead, you have to give the employee the choice between taking the money as cash wages or allocating that money toward the purchase of insurance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one lawyer we talked to who disagreed is Seth Perretta, who represents a number of large business organizations with a stake in the various rule-makings of the Affordable Care Act. ''I can condition employment on all sorts of things,'' Mr. Perretta said. ''I can condition a subset of compensation on all sorts of things, on the employee doing lawful acts. I think it really turns on whether the regulators would agree that so long as the amount I'm paying to you is not directly related to the amount you pay for insurance, whether or not disconnecting the two would allow me to treat that as a taxable wage.'' Even Mr. Perretta said the answer was still not clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose an owner just gives raises and doesn't specifically reimburse premiums? Can the owner tailor the amount of additional compensation for each person to the cost of health insurance without crossing the line into reimbursement?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, at least if the owner gives the raise unconditionally. (Mr. Perretta said it was unclear whether correlating a conditional raise would be permissible because ''we are in uncharted territory.'') For example, the raises could follow the government's age curve that sets the relative cost for premiums in the individual market. ''Employee pay rates and raises are subject to various employment non-discrimination rules but, other than that, employers have wide discretion in setting pay,'' said Linda Mendel, a lawyer in Columbus, Ohio. It is not illegal, by the way, to discriminate in favor of older workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about Zane Benefits, which is promoting a plan it says allows companies to reimburse employees who buy individual insurance with pre-tax dollars -- and even lets lower paid employees who qualify claim federal subsidies when they buy their insurance on the exchanges. How is this possible?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not, at least according to federal regulators. The recent guidance did not mention Zane by name, but it referred to the type of plan it uses (a Section 105 plan, after that section of the tax code) and said that it, like other reimbursement plans, was subject to the Affordable Care Act's insurance market reforms but cannot comply with them because of the reimbursement mechanism. Moreover, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> declared, ''employees participating in such arrangements are ineligible for premium tax credits (or cost-sharing reductions) for Marketplace coverage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zane, for its part, published its own FAQ in response to the Department of Labor FAQ. In it, Zane insisted that its plan complies with the health law and that businesses that use it can rest assured that their employees can qualify for exchange subsidies. ''This is nothing new,'' Rick Lindquist, Zane's president, wrote in an email about the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span>'s guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the lawyers we've talked to disagree with Zane's legal reasoning, but until one side or the other forces a resolution of the issue, it will be Zane's word against the government's.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current laws and regulations are not enough to prevent fraud in New York State and City programs meant to steer contracts to businesses owned by women and members of minority groups, according to a grand jury report released on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grand jury, empaneled at the request of Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, found evidence of criminal fraud by several construction companies, spanning at least a decade and involving more than $10 million, the report said. The schemes typically involved government contractors pretending to hire minority-owned companies that never performed the work.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unfortunate reality, as today's report reveals, is that fraud within these programs is persistent,'' Mr. Vance said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grand jury voted to indict officials of one company, but the indictment has not been unsealed, prosecutors said. For years, fraud has plagued state and city programs intended to give work to businesses owned by women and members of minority groups. Most of the cases have ended in deferred prosecution agreements under which the company pays a large penalty and charges are eventually dismissed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, for instance, the owner of DCM Erectors, Larry Davis, was charged with using fake work orders and false business records to make it seem as if the company was in compliance with the minority hiring requirements of the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2013, Mr. Vance said Schlesinger-<span class="companylink">Siemens</span> Electrical had submitted false documents to the state exaggerating the role of minority-owned subcontractors on a Department of Environmental Protection project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 15-page report, the grand jury made several recommendations to discourage similar frauds. It said that fines and prison sentences should be increased and that the agencies charged with certifying minority- and female-owned businesses should be given more resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also urged government agencies to start requesting that prime contractors ''certify under penalty of perjury'' that minority-owned subcontractors are performing work at construction sites, not just ''renting'' their names to other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the report said, contractors hired a minority-owned subcontractor to act as a ''pass-through,'' receiving payments and then handing the money on to a nonminority company that did the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In others, a minority-owned company allowed its name to be used in documents as the source of supplies when the goods in reality came from another, nonminority-owned company. A third scheme involved contractors who created shell companies in the name of a female relative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programs are managed by the <span class="companylink">Empire State Development Corporation</span> and the city Office of Contract Services. To be eligible for certification, more than half of a company must be owned by a woman or a member of a minority group. Both the city and the state currently ask prime contractors to direct about a third of the work to minority- and female-owned companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers' Association, said those goals were too high given the pool of available companies. He said the government had to do a better job vetting businesses on official lists to ensure they had the capacity to carry out major projects.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- With negotiators nearing an accord on permanent tax breaks for businesses worth $440 billion over 10 years, President Obama rallied Democratic opposition on Tuesday and promised a veto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The president would veto the proposed deal because it would provide permanent tax breaks to help well-connected corporations while neglecting working families,'' said Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, negotiated by House Republicans and aides to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the outgoing majority leader, showed how much power has shifted since the Republican election victories this month. The negotiations fractured Democrats, and separated the Obama administration from Mr. Reid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Obama's threat showed that he could still wield his authority as well. White House officials said the package, intended to avoid letting a host of politically popular tax breaks expire at the end of the year, is too heavily tilted toward corporations and will have deep repercussions for budget and tax negotiations far into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A veto would be the third and by far the most significant of Mr. Obama's presidency. His threat sent negotiators back to the table to see if Republicans could add measures that would win liberal support, especially a permanently expanded child tax credit for the working poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's somewhat ironic they're willing to just proceed here, unpaid for, leave the middle class behind and include a lot of things that I think wouldn't benefit our economy,'' said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of the deal in both parties said the emerging accord would lock in tax breaks that have been passed in short-term increments, year after year. Doing so would give businesses more certainty about making investments, they said, while extending tax benefits that already have broad bipartisan support. And <span class="companylink">Senate</span> Democrats said they cut the best deal possible before next year's Republican takeover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Obama and Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, personally stepped in with a furious round of calling Tuesday afternoon to promise a veto. Shaun Donovan, the White House budget director, and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew also called lawmakers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said a veto would be sustained, even if the negotiated package were chock-full of tax breaks for constituents of <span class="companylink">Senate</span> Democrats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, made several calls to key House Democrats to ensure the votes would be there in the House to sustain the president's veto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The light of day has changed the way this agreement might look,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standoff has set up a high-stakes game of chicken. Some 55 tax breaks for businesses and individuals expired last year, and if they are not revived retroactively by Dec. 31, taxpayers will not be able to claim them for the current tax year. Republicans say Congress might pass a one-year retroactive measure that would simply start the fight all over again in January, when they control <span class="companylink">the Senate</span> and their numbers are fortified in the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emerging tax legislation would make permanent 10 provisions, including an expanded research and development tax credit, which businesses and the Obama administration have wanted to make permanent for years; a measure allowing small businesses to deduct virtually any investment; the deduction for state and local sales taxes; the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college costs; deductions for employer-provided mass transit; and four different breaks for corporate and charitable giving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller measures already passed by the Senate Finance Committee, from tax breaks for car-racing tracks to benefits for racehorse owners, would be extended for one year and retroactively renewed for the current tax year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit for wind power, a Democratic priority, would phase out and end after 2017. Many conservatives oppose the wind credit as an unfair boost to an energy industry in competition with oil and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left off were the two tax breaks valued most by liberal Democrats: a permanently expanded earned-income credit and a child tax credit for the working poor. Friday night, Republican negotiators announced they would exclude those measures as payback for the president's executive order on immigration, saying a surge of newly legalized workers would claim the credit, tax aides from both parties said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican aides involved in the negotiations reacted angrily to the White House's efforts to torpedo the talks. They noted that Mr. Obama had pushed for his own version of a permanent, expanded research and development credit as a boon to the economy and embraced a narrower proposal to let small businesses deduct the cost of investments. Now, they say, he is reversing himself rather than accept yes for an answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential repercussions of the deal are broad. Republicans taking over the House and Senate budget committees have vowed to pass plans that bring the federal budget into balance in 10 years without raising taxes or cutting the defense budget. If the tax deal is passed, that will mean those budget plans will have to cut deeper into domestic spending. Republicans also have vowed to overhaul the tax code but with a reformed system that brings in the same amount of revenue. That revenue target would shrink by $440 billion over the next decade, a tiny share of overall spending but a big hole for lawmakers to fill if it meant raising taxes elsewhere or cutting spending for important constituencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''An extender package that makes permanent expiring business provisions without addressing tax credits for working families is the wrong approach, at the expense of middle-class families,'' Mr. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said of the deal. ''Any deal on tax extenders must ensure that the economic benefits are broadly shared.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democratic negotiators say they secured measures they might not be able to win next year. The American Opportunity Tax Credit was proposed by Mr. Obama and passed in the 2009 stimulus law. A permanent extension would give $97 billion in tax relief over 10 years to families of students in higher education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax incentives for charitable giving would total $16 billion over a decade. And Republicans tossed in provisions specifically aimed at winning Democratic votes, such as making permanent the deduction for employer-provided mass transit benefits. Keeping the deduction for state and local sales taxes had appeal to Mr. Reid, whose home state has no income tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the costs of the business tax breaks would make up two-thirds of the total value of the package, including the R.&amp;D. tax credit's $156 billion and $73 billion to allow small businesses to deduct from their taxes all investments in new plants and equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials blasted that provision as too broad, noting it could apply to law partners purchasing a new sport utility vehicle for their practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the wind power credit, which Democrats argue is still needed to keep renewable energy competitive with cheap fossil fuels, would lose 20 percent of its value in 2016 and 40 percent though much of 2017, vanishing entirely by the final three months of that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition to the emerging accord united the liberal wing of the Democratic Party with budget hawks who objected to its cost. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, denounced what she called horse trading that bid up the package's price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know every special-interest group wants to protect its tax break, and members want to continue to dole out all the goodies,'' she said. ''But hey, my kid wants a pony. It doesn't mean someone doesn't have to pay for it.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In announcing a plan to spur investment in public works and loans to small businesses, the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> is finally acknowledging that it needs to do more to bolster its economy. Unfortunately, the new plan is inadequate and overly complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the E.U. would increase small-business lending and investment in roads, renewable energy, schools and other public services by 315 billion euros ($394 billion) over three years. Most of the money will come from private investors, which could include banks, insurance companies and pension funds. The E.U. and the <span class="companylink">European Investment Bank</span>, which is an arm of the union, will put up €21 billion of guarantees to encourage the private sector to participate in the program.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no doubt that Europe needs to do more to pump up investment. The <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> estimates that total annual investment levels are lagging the historical average before the 2007 financial crisis by €270 billion to €340 billion. But the new plan known as the European Fund for <span class="companylink">Strategic Investments</span>, which still has to be approved by the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> and national governments, will amount to only slightly more than €100 billion a year in investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Juncker said that the total amount invested under the program could be much higher if individual countries agree to also contribute to the €21 billion guarantee, though it is unclear how much they would be willing to commit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with the plan is that at least some of the investments will be money shifted away from investments that private firms would have made anyway. Such displacement will not provide much of a shot in the arm to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A far better approach would have been for the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> or its members to borrow money and invest it directly. Such borrowing would carry a small cost because yields on the bonds issued by European governments are at or near historical lows -- Italy, for example, can borrow money for 10 years at 2.16 percent and Germany can borrow at just 0.73 percent. Moreover, spending on public works during a downturn can pay for itself by boosting economic growth, as a recent <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> report pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But European leaders are adamant that they will not increase debt because the budgets of the national governments are already stretched and the E.U.'s budget must always be balanced under the terms of treaties governing the union, something European leaders should change. The insistence on not increasing debt even as the economy weakens, especially in the 18 countries that use the euro, is self-defeating. The euro area is at risk of getting ''stuck in persistent stagnation'' if policy makers do not stimulate demand, the <span class="companylink">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</span> said in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's new investment plan is better than the status quo, but its leaders will need to do a lot more to revive the economy.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- President Obama, joined by his daughters, went shopping Saturday at Politics and Prose, an independent bookstore in the capital, in what has become a Thanksgiving weekend tradition for the first family to honor Small Business Saturday -- an outing that mixed policy and purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president and his daughters, Sasha and Malia, browsed the shelves and chatted with customers before buying two bags full of books at the store, where they also shopped at this time last year. According to a White House print pool report, Mr. Obama at one point held a patron's baby.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the checkout counter, a cashier asked the president, ''You from out of town?'' Mr. Obama replied, ''I am. Do I get a discount for that?'' Another cashier jokingly offered a ''neighbor discount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll take that,'' Mr. Obama said, in an exchange captured by a television pool video posted by CBS News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama spotted a new book behind the register, ''The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House,'' by Chuck Todd, host of <span class="companylink">NBC</span>'s ''Meet the Press.'' The president noted that he looked ''lonely'' on the cover, and Malia asked, ''How is he already writing a book?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a smile, Malia added that her father looked sad on the cover. ''Looks like a sad book,'' she said teasingly, in a typical family exchange not often seen from the Obamas in public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One customer asked Mr. Obama about closing the military detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and the president responded, ''We're working on it. Thank you. Any other issues?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obamas bought 17 books, including several intended for children, among them titles from the ''Redwall'' fantasy series by Brian Jacques and the ''Junie B. Jones'' series by Barbara Park. The memoir ''Brown Girl Dreaming'' by Jacqueline Woodson was also selected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One classic made the list, ''Heart of Darkness,'' by Joseph Conrad, and a few contemporary releases, like ''All the Light We Cannot See'' by Anthony Doerr, ''Nora Webster'' by Colm Toibin and ''The Laughing Monsters'' by Denis Johnson. They bought two nonfiction titles: ''Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China'' by Evan Osnos and ''Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End'' by Dr. Atul Gawande. Also among the Obamas' purchases were ''Cartwheeling in Thunderstorms'' by Katherine Rundell and ''The Narrow Road to the Deep North'' by Richard Flanagan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama said that some of the purchases would be Christmas presents, but did not specify which titles were gifts. Introduced in 2010, Small Business Saturday encourages shoppers to support local, independent stores, even as corporate retailers push for big spending on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, the White House posted a quote from Mr. Obama on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>: ''As we mark #SmallBusinessSaturday, let us continue to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit wherever we find it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the cashier rang up his purchases, Mr. Obama handed over a credit card. ''Hope it works,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One summer day two years ago, Ivan Vesic, a software engineer who lives in the southern Serbian city of Nis, rushed to a local veterinary clinic. A car had hit his rescue cat, Damian, badly damaging his leg and tail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vet, Mirza Sejdinovic, had to amputate the cat's tail but managed to save his leg. Mr. Vesic sighed with relief; Damian was going to be fine. The two men began to chat and Mr. Sejdinovic complained about the software at his clinic. Mr. Vesic looked at the computer screen and quickly concluded there must be a better way to manage a veterinary practice.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the following weeks Mr. Vesic and Mr. Sejdinovic realized they could do something much more ambitious -- create user-friendly software to be used by vet practices all over the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We decided that we should actually quit our jobs and start building a start-up,'' Mr. Vesic said, adding that the team was joined by a third partner, Milan Djordjevic, a programmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their company, VetCloud, was born. More than two years later, after extensive testing in the Balkans and Britain, its practice management software was introduced in London in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vesic, 38, Mr. Sejdinovic, 30, and Mr. Djordjevic, 36, are among hundreds of entrepreneurs in the Balkans who have launched tech start-ups that they hope to take global, at the same time transforming this ex-communist, relatively poor corner of Europe -- known best abroad as war-torn, corrupt and unstable -- into a hub for technology and innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe it's only a matter of time before we have a Skype-level success from the region,'' said Lyuben Belov, managing partner at Launchub, a seed fund based in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, which invests in digital start-ups in southeast Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone will make it big on the global market,'' he added, predicting that a Balkan company would be traded on the Nasdaq in New York one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Balkan start-ups, like Emailio, a company co-founded by a Bulgarian high school student working on a mobile app to de-clutter inboxes, have moved to Silicon Valley. Flipps, an app that lets users stream video from mobile devices to a television, has also swapped Bulgaria for the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another fillip for the region's start-ups, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> announced in July that it was buying LiveRail, a video ad company co-founded by two Romanians, for a reported $400 million to $500 million. In October, <span class="companylink">Progress Software</span>, based in Bedford, Mass., said it planned to acquire <span class="companylink">Telerik</span>, a Bulgarian software company, for $262.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, big international companies have outsourced information technology work to Eastern Europe. They have been attracted by relatively cheap labor, low rent and a pool of qualified software developers, whose skills reflect a tradition of strong math and engineering education that goes back to communist times. Low business taxes help -- Bulgaria, for example, offers a flat rate of 10 percent. Now, those very same reasons are encouraging Balkan entrepreneurs to start their own businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Balkans are up against tough competition from Europe's top start-up destinations, like London, Berlin, Helsinki and Stockholm, where access to venture capital is easier and the start-up scene is much more advanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Balkan entrepreneurs are blessed with ambition, tech know-how and enthusiasm, these would-be billionaires also face red tape, a dearth of government incentives and their own lack of business experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Balkan governments are slowly getting more involved in the sector. Serbia has an Innovation Fund financed by the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>, which has awarded 53 grants, amounting to €6 million so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sofia is building a €50 million technology park -- also with funding from Brussels -- to link local businesses and universities and foster innovation. President Rosen Plevneliev of Bulgaria declared at a groundbreaking ceremony in July that it would be ''the heart of start-up culture'' in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Nis, VetCloud's team has been developing a cloud-based software for vets, which stores medical records, handles appointments and sends alerts when new supplies of medicine are needed. To win investment for their company, they did not go to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, but to Sofia, where more tech money resides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While there was a community in Belgrade, there was already an ecosystem in Sofia,'' said Mr. Vesic, the company's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm has received €200,000 from Eleven, an accelerator fund that offers a training and mentorship program in return for a stake in the companies it supports. The VetCloud team spent three months in Bulgaria, learning the nuts and bolts of starting and running a tech company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got the money and advice we needed,'' Mr. Vesic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launchub and Eleven manage a total of €21 million as part of a <span class="companylink">European Union</span>-sponsored initiative to support small and midsize businesses, named Jeremie. They have distributed €9 million among 120 start-ups from the region in the past two years and plan to fund around 200 firms by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, German and international venture capitalists in Berlin invested €133 million in start-ups in 2012, according to a McKinsey study from last year. But a small amount of funding goes a long way in the Balkans, where costs for starting a business are much lower than those in Berlin or London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs have had to overcome the long tradition of outsourcing in the Balkans to want to work for themselves and come up with the next must-have app or big e-business success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milos Milic, a 25-year-old Serbian IT developer, is part of the new generation. Last December, he and his business partner, Srdjan Stupar, quit their jobs to start Farmia, an online exchange for livestock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milic described the change as the best thing that has ever happened to him. ''We have smaller salaries now, but we have a chance to build our own company,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, Serbian start-ups had to look abroad for financing. But funds like StartLabs, launched last year, aim to fill this gap, offering funding of up to $50,000 and connecting firms with mentors and foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the best time to start something like this,'' said Nebojsa Lazic, the StartLabs' general partner. Things have changed, he added, since the days when entrepreneurs were half-jokingly called ''superheroes with suicidal tendencies''.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Silicon Valley companies, which have access to hundreds of millions of consumers in the United States alone, Balkan firms are based in a region fragmented into small markets. But Dilyan Dimitrov, one of Eleven's founders, says this can be a plus as it forces regional start-ups to develop ideas with broader appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone who is starting a tech product is very much aware that they have to make a global-scalable product,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Playground Energy, based in Sofia, is trying to do exactly that. The company makes playground equipment that generates electricity from children's play. The electricity powers lights, sounds and other effects to encourage the children to play longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's co-founder, Hristo Alexiev, says that being based in Bulgaria gives the company significant advantages. It can pursue a strategy of global growth while using local designers and developers. That keeps costs low, making the most of the €200,000 it has secured in investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we moved to America, we'd have spent half of the money just on the move, rent, lawyers,'' said Mr. Alexiev, who, at 44, talks about Playground Energy, his sixth start-up, with the enthusiasm of a 17-year-old launching his first business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others have chosen a different path, moving to London or Berlin, where they believe they can grow faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unioncy, an online platform designed to let people keep track of their purchases and store their warranties, bills, insurance and manuals all in one place, moved from Sofia to London, where they found more investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Unioncy's fate shows that moving to a big tech hub is no guarantee of success. The business quickly went from start-up to shutdown, announcing its demise at the end of October due to ''larger than anticipated technical challenges.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VetCloud, the Serbian start-up, also established a presence in London after receiving financing and mentoring from the British office of TechStars, an international fund. ''We decided to move where our market is,'' said Mr. Vesic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While start-ups in the Balkans hope for a big breakthrough, one nearby ex-communist country has already scored a string of international successes. Hungary was the launch pad for companies including Prezi, the popular cloud-based presentation software; Ustream, a live video-streaming platform; and LogMeIn, which gives users remote access to their computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prezi was created in 2009 as an alternative to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s ubiquitous PowerPoint. Five years later, it has 45 million users around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a co-founder, Peter Halacsy, the key to start-up success is ''not the money, it's not the infrastructure, not the legal system'' but changing the way people think -- getting away from a stuffy, risk-averse, communist-era mentality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Ustream and LogMeIn, Prezi created a nongovernmental organization called Bridge Budapest that aims to help and inspire a new generation of Hungarian entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here, parents tell their kids: 'Don't try, it's risky. Go work in a bank, that would be better for you,''' said Veronika Pistyur, the organization's chief executive. ''Now I can see that more and more people are willing to try.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, so far, newer Hungarian start-ups have not managed to reach the same level of success as Prezi and the other established stars of Budapest's tech scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the Balkans, investors are under no illusions that the region will become another Silicon Valley, but some say it could still play a worthwhile role in the international tech scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What can develop here is a kind of incubator for talents -- places that yield people with interesting ideas,'' said Maxim Gurvits, a partner at Sofia-based Teres Capital, which plans to start a venture capital fund to invest in startups in Central and Eastern Europe. ''So, the next time you want to create a company, you go to Sofia, not New York, because it's very expensive there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Balkans may have plenty of coders, investors say the shortage of people with business experience is a serious disadvantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Belov, from Launchub, ''the only way to have a big success is to have the developers here but the sales and marketing outsourced to places where those skills are developed to perfection, like London and Silicon Valley.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some tech entrepreneurs also want more immediate and practical help. Some point to the example of the <span class="companylink">British government</span>, which offers big tax breaks to investors in start-ups and the companies themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All start-ups need tax benefits and a more relaxed tax system during the first year or two,'' said Danica Radisic, a Belgrade-based entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite current obstacles, the coders keep working on their big ideas. In addition to its launch in Britain, VetCloud has been negotiating partnerships with distributors in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vesic dreams big. ''If you use <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span> to sync your files, if you use <span class="companylink">Google</span> to search the Internet, you'll use VetCloud to manage vets' medical records,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDLeslie Lienau is hunting for cash, again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After raising $41,000 in a Kickstarter campaign last year, she is hoping to expand her company, which makes educational tools for artists. But like many small-business owners, Ms. Lienau, who owns the Conservatory for Classical Art, an art school in Edmond, Okla., says traditional financing is elusive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks will not lend to her. A venture capital investment is out of the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our company is too new, and our product is not in a place where we can scale fast enough,'' Ms. Lienau, 53, said in an interview last month. ''It's just so much better for us to bootstrap it, so to speak, and go to the crowd.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lienau's company, Miira Artist Tools, is the kind of fledgling company President Obama wanted to help in 2012 when he signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, better known as the JOBS Act. Part of the law, Title III, was intended to allow small businesses seeking capital to crowdfund, or raise money from virtually anyone, by selling stock and other securities over the Internet. ''Start-ups and small business will now have access to a big, new pool of potential investors,'' Mr. Obama said at the time. ''For the first time, ordinary Americans will be able to go online and invest in entrepreneurs that they believe in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Congress</span> directed the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> to finalize the rules by December 2012, but the agency has yet to do so. As it reviews Title III of the JOBS Act, a debate has raged. Supporters say crowdfunding is an innovative way to finance new ideas. Others say the high risk associated with backing early-stage businesses is inappropriate for ordinary investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only accredited investors -- those with annual income of more than $200,000 or $1 million in net worth not including their primary residence -- are permitted to participate in crowdfunding deals. Under the proposed rules, which the S.E.C. introduced in October 2013, businesses could raise up to $1 million in a 12-month period without registering the offering with the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The goal is to democratize and improve finance,'' said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, who worked on the House crowdfunding bill that was incorporated into the JOBS Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In writing its rules, the S.E.C. adopted strict requirements intended to minimize fraud and protect investors. Individuals who are not accredited investors, for instance, would face limits on how much they could invest. Businesses would be required to go through a registered broker or a new type of registered platform called a funding portal for their offerings. Businesses also would be required to submit audited financial statements. The rules are still under review and may change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics are concerned that the rules do not do enough to protect investors, however sophisticated they may be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without anybody doing anything wrong, without any fraud, most start-ups fail,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span>, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''We're actually encouraging people to make investments that we would deem to be unsuitable if they were recommended by a broker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C. declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the long wait for the rules to be completed, start-ups across the country are expressing interest in crowdfunding. Many see it as a way to form deeper ties with early customers by giving them a stake in the company's success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funding platforms have been preparing for what they hope will be enormous demand once the law takes effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One platform, Wefunder, has about 34,000 investors and has helped companies -- including one that builds flying cars -- raise more than $5 million from accredited investors, said Mike Norman, Wefunder's co-founder and president. Dealflicks, a discount site for movie tickets, based in Los Angeles, used Wefunder this year to raise $173,450 from 64 backers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another funding platform, SeedInvest, began doing accredited deals about 18 months ago, said Kiran Lingam, general counsel for the company. But he said the excitement about Title III crowdfunding had appeared to wane. ''There's sort of a wait-and-see approach,'' Mr. Lingam said. ''Title III is just so far removed because of the delay that it's not really top of mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Indiana, the crowdfunding platform Localstake has used certain securities laws to allow companies to raise money through a process that more closely resembles true crowdfunding. Under one rule, for example, businesses in a state may raise capital from investors in that state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through Localstake, Cardinal Spirits, a distillery based in Bloomington, Ind., raised $850,000 last year from accredited and nonaccredited investors. The company, which produces vodka, gin, whiskey and fruit liqueurs, also borrowed from a regional bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is this kind of success that has attracted entrepreneurs like Dillon Dakota Carroll to crowdfunding, even as the S.E.C. continues to drag its heels. Mr. Carroll's company, Levaté of Oklahoma City has developed a lift device for wheelchairs. It is securing $200,000 from angel investors and is looking to raise $30,000 in a Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For its next financing round, Mr. Carroll, 23, said he hoped to raise $1 million using Lendoor, a crowdfunding platform for small business loans, and financing through a combination of government grants and additional investments. A bank loan, however, is probably not an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No traditional lending institution is going to want to give to any new start-up that doesn't have any sales yet,'' he said.</p>

Back then she believed she could help small-business owners track their finances with her start-up's software. But as it turned out, Ms. Mah could barely keep <span class="companylink">InDinero</span> afloat, let alone help others run their businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its first version, <span class="companylink">InDinero</span>, in San Francisco, charged its few customers $20 a month for its software. Competition, which included companies like QuickBooks, was fierce, and a series of bad hires added to <span class="companylink">InDinero</span>'s woes.

But by the time she realized this, in 2012, <span class="companylink">InDinero</span> had spent nearly all of the $1.2 million it had raised from investors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent conversation, which has been edited and condensed, Ms. Mah talked about how she turned things around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What were the first signs of a problem?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We were down to the last $150,000 of the $1.2 million we had raised, and were burning $80,000 to $100,000 a month. Once we got down to about $250,000 we knew we had to dial back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What steps did you take once you realized <span class="companylink">InDinero</span> was in serious trouble?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We got rid of our office and employees so we had no expenses. My co-founder, Andy Su, and I moved into an apartment together and got our parents to cover our rent and food. I would have moved home, but my family is in New York, and the company is in California. Then, for most of 2012, we tried to figure out what magical feature we could build to fix <span class="companylink">InDinero</span>.</p>

Looking at companies like Salesforce and <span class="companylink">NetSuite</span>, I learned a few things. They all solve a big business problem that justifies a price point higher than $20 a month. They have seasoned executives and well-trained sales teams. They're nearly 100 percent premium, with very limited free offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How did this help you change your product?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We knew we needed a product that we could charge a few hundred dollars a month for. I spent countless hours interviewing entrepreneurs of all different shapes and sizes to figure out their accounting and tax needs. We knew they wanted a one-stop accounting solution. It was a big problem for them that we didn't file their taxes. We had to go from offering a cheap software solution that didn't actually solve any problems to being an all-in-one accounting back office with accountants on staff. We had to do it all, including taxes and payroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How big a business can your software handle -- especially when it comes to filing taxes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Our 500 customers range from a two-employee start-up with no sales to a 100-employee company with eight-figure sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What do you charge?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Businesses pay between $400 and $5,000 per month, depending on how complicated their accounting is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How are you marketing your service?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We've found the best way to get new business is to incentivize our current customers. For every referral a customer gives us, we give them a free month. We've found that, out of five customers, four won't send any referrals, but one will send 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Once you had the right product, how did you go about hiring the right people?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I thought about the mistakes I made the first time. I realized I had hired too many of my friends. I should have spent more time evaluating candidates outside my network -- expanding the candidate pool through external recruiters, LinkedIn, specialty job boards and other methods. My original interview process wasn't thorough. I had no defined criteria to evaluate candidates against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you have any favorite interview questions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes, I ask the same ones to every single candidate. Some are, ''What's the hardest you've ever worked in your life, what's your most lofty ambition and what are you doing for self-development?'' I want to know what books and blogs they read, what conferences they go to, whether they're working on side projects in their fields and whether they've ever run a company. I want a company full of mini-C.E.O.s. I also ask about their relationship with their last boss. If they talk about how horrible their last boss was, I'm done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Has your management style changed since <span class="companylink">InDinero</span>'s early days?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Yes, I'm focused on going from being a C.E.O. who did the work herself to an effective leader. I'm taking the personal growth thing very seriously. I've hired executive coaches and joined Y.P.O. [<span class="companylink">Young Presidents' Organization</span>]. Last year, I read more than 100 leadership books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is it hard to let go of the day-to-day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In the past, I didn't spend enough time recruiting for senior leadership. I tried to manage 20 people all by myself with no strong managers to grow the company. Now, I don't spend any time having individual contributors report to me. I go straight to finding a strong V.P./director-level person who can build the team out for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Did <span class="companylink">InDinero</span>'s early problems test your relationship with your co-founder?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Andy and I have always had a strong relationship. We're good friends -- and still roommates. Living together is key because we can work on business challenges at all hours of the day. I don't see this changing anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's the division of labor between you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm responsible for customer happiness and customer acquisition. Andy, the chief technology officer, is responsible for product and engineering. We split all the other business functions -- like legal, finance and operations -- 50-50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How do you resolve disputes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If we disagree on how to deal with something, we ask the other person how strongly they feel on a 1-to-10 scale about that particular issue. The person who cares more will make the decision. We also see an executive coach to help mediate our disagreements. On top of that, we go to co-founder marriage counseling! [The co-founders are not romantically involved.] One of our core company values is ''rethink the obvious,'' so I got the idea to reach out to marriage counselors listed on Yelp to see if any would work with us. Even though marriage counseling is usually for dysfunctional couples, co-founders often have the same petty debates. We wanted to be proactive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What have you learned about early success -- and failure?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In the beginning, because of my age, I got a lot of wunderkind attention. It's important to stay humble and not get carried away by early success -- but the same is true of failure. Neither necessarily lasts. So, when <span class="companylink">InDinero</span> was in trouble, I just talked to my parents and friends, lay low and focused on results.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VIVIAN MARINO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How do your responsibilities differ from those of your brother?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I head up the New York office and lead real estate -- real estate sourcing, underwriting, bringing in new transactions. He handles more day-to-day management. He's more hands-on; I kind of enjoy the creative side of business development of launching new markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How is it working so closely with your brother?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's been great. We work very well off each other, with different interests and different passions. I came out of business school in 2010 and started this with my brother, so it's my first long-working experience with a partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We came from a real estate development background. Our father is in real estate -- that's where it began. He founded <span class="companylink">Western Development Corporation</span>, and they built around 20 million square feet. We started our own development business, WestMill Capital -- my brother and I -- and initially built Fundrise as a platform to raise capital for those projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is WestMill still in operation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We still have the initial assets we bought, but we've shut down regular operations. We now put all our resources toward Fundrise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Does Fundrise develop?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Fundrise is just the funding platform. We're just focused on Fundrise as a platform for real estate companies to raise capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our first public offering was in 2012. It took two years of regulatory work to make the first deal possible. Our first public offering was in 2012, and in 2013 we opened it up to third-party real estate operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How many transactions have you been involved with so far?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We've done over 30 transactions in 10 markets across the country. New York and D.C. are our two biggest markets. They make up about half of our business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've had eight transactions in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Let's talk about the New York deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. They're actually in different neighborhoods. Two are in Manhattan -- the East Village and Harlem. And others are in Brooklyn -- Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Bushwick, Prospect Heights, Prospect-Lefferts Garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've all been fully funded. Most of the developers we work with are urban infill developers in major metro areas. Most of these deals are $20 million and below, kind of below private equity radar. We can come in and provide a valuable amount of capital and make use of the technology to raise the funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What's the average amount of capital raised per project?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. To date, it's been about $1 million. But we have a large transaction -- our largest to date -- that will close in 2015. That's about $10.5 million. That's in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'll have a few transactions that are $5 million or $10 million, so it's growing very quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Can you disclose a little more about that big project?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I can't comment yet on the transaction. It's a commercial property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How much have you raised so far?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We raised $38 million for the company and just over $30 million for the transactions. They're separate numbers; they just happen to be close. Our investors include <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, Rockrose and Forest City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We did over 20 transactions in 2014 and we raised $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We hope to do $100 million in 2015, scaled to 25, 30 cities across the country. We're also looking at Europe, starting in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Have you worked on any deals involving the developers that have invested in your business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We haven't done any transactions with them yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've invested in the platform. They've had a lot of interest in this concept and we've had a lot of meetings with them over the years to educate them on what we've been doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. The big developers can raise money on their own. Why would they want to crowdsource?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. There's a real branding and marketing benefit to be raising publicly, and to be connected with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In having these investors in the deals supporting that asset, they're more likely to spend money at the restaurant, they're more likely to buy condos. They can actually improve the outcome of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Most of the projects you helped fund so far have been relatively small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Small to midsize infill. That's where we found the niche -- below institutional private equity scale. There's less sources of capital and we can be more valuable in those transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is there a minimum or maximum investment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The minimum is $100. The average investment is about $5,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally the maximum has been around $1 million, but we have groups that are now coming in for larger amounts -- institutional investors have started to look at this. This gives them a window into a new pool of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What kinds of returns do investors get?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Most of the returns are between 10 and 16 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How safe are these investments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We haven't had any failures. Probably the biggest skepticism to date is: What's the quality of the deals and of the underwriting? And that's going to have to play out over time.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees at <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> thought they saw a drop-off in credit card volume last spring at one of their merchants, a legal services provider. Checking further, they found they had a new competitor, Behalf, a start-up small-business lender backed by two venture capital firms that makes credit decisions in just a few seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than play defense, a reaction banks and credit card companies were likelier to have not that long ago, <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> engaged Behalf and worked with the start-up to help arrange for its customers to use <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>'s system to pay their vendors.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>-Behalf alliance, which has not been publicly announced, is an example of how entrenched financial players facing challengers armed with new technology are increasingly seeking to work with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new attitude comes as disruptive businesses are being taken more seriously. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, for instance, which competes with banks and credit cards by matching borrowers and lenders on the Internet, went public in December at a valuation of more than $8 billion. Two months earlier, Apple introduced ApplePay, a mobile payment service that uses existing bank and credit card systems, though it raised the specter of future upheaval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At first, we saw the banks and credit card companies were aware of the disruption but didn't realize the scale it would reach,'' said Shmil Levy, a partner at Sequoia Capital, one of Behalf's venture backers, along with Spark Capital. More recently, he said, ''we are starting to see the banks trying to cooperate instead of being displaced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> created a division to engage with financial innovators, making a handful of investments in start-ups. In October, <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> announced a partnership with Zwipe, which makes a credit card with a fingerprint sensor, and in November, it bought a stake in a company now called Nymi that makes a wristband that uses a heartbeat to authenticate a user's identity. In December, it invested in Dynamics, which makes cards with buttons and displays that allow users to, for example, pay in different currencies or choose credit or debit. In recent presentations to Wall Street analysts and investors, <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> has also talked about or shown soft-drink machines and washers and dryers with links to its mobile payment system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are open to any and all conversations,'' said Garry Lyons, the chief innovation officer in Dublin for <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>. Although ''disruption is a potential threat to established companies,'' he added, ''we're open to working with new emerging companies'' to serve customers' needs. He said <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> and its customers could both benefit from ''access to external thinking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">American Express</span> opened a new technology hub to expand its presence in Silicon Valley, focusing on innovations in big data, cloud computing and mobile payments. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has a venture capital arm that has invested in companies ''with the potential to disrupt and transform'' financial services. And in August, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> inaugurated a ''start-up accelerator'' to invest in companies that are developing tools for the financial industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the upstarts have openly vowed to feast on the incumbents' longtime way of doing business, which relies on legacy systems and faces heavy regulatory scrutiny. The lingering hangover from the 2008 financial crisis also curtailed their ability to lend, especially to small businesses. ''There's a tremendous amount of incumbent inertia,'' Pat Grady, a Sequoia partner who is backing Prosper, another online lending platform, said in mid-2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Harris, a venture investor who focuses on financial services technology at Bain Capital Ventures in New York, said that banks' attitudes had shifted from disdain five years ago to a greater willingness to ''partner with the disrupters'' in the last 18 to 24 months. The first catalyst, he said, was the advent of Square, a Silicon Valley mobile payments service started in 2010. ''That got everyone's attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and dozens of other similar online marketplaces threatened banks most directly because, in theory, they offer loans at rates below those of credit cards and offer investors returns above what they get on bank deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike an earlier round of profit-seeking venture initiatives during the dot-com boom 15 years ago, Mr. Harris added, the current round ''seems largely driven by a fear of missing out, and the knowledge that entrepreneurs are gunning for what had historically been their exclusive province.'' He added, ''This is more like 'Barbarians at the Gate.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they engage with would-be competitors, the incumbents insist that they are keeping their eyes open. ''We now exist in a world of what we call frenemies,'' said Leslie Berland, head of digital partnerships at <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. ''Many companies that we work with may pose challenges as well as opportunities.'' As <span class="companylink">American Express</span> works with partners in mobile payments, social networks and online retailing, she said, the card giant must consider, ''more than we ever have before, what do we control, what does the platform control'' and how to keep access to data needed to service and reward card holders and merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Hopkins, the chief innovation officer at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> who also heads Citi Ventures, put it another way. ''We do something we call the Pac-Man analysis of the models that are nibbling, maybe starting to chomp, and how can we embrace them, how can we learn from the entrepreneurial ecosystem?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Dill, head of innovation and strategic partnerships at <span class="companylink">Visa</span>, said the payments technology company aimed to ''compete vigorously'' against disruption that threatened its business, but wanted to team up with new entrants that could extend its business. He pointed to <span class="companylink">Visa</span>'s investment in July in LoopPay, which has a technology that allows mobile devices to convey payment data to existing magnetic card readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some banks are not as enthusiastic, arguing that the new entrants have not earned the same level of trust as established institutions, and that some may be charging excessive interest rates. Mr. Harris noted that <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, for example, had been less prominent in teaming with the upstarts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks have already decided to move ahead with partnerships. <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks</span>, No. 13 among banks in the United States in assets, acquired the online lender FirstAgain in 2012, and restarted the business as LightStream in March 2013. It offers unsecured personal loans up to $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s chief executive, Renaud Laplanche, said he, too, was open to partnerships with incumbents. Two years ago, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> started working with a few small community banks, which invested in loans on the platform. In May, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> unveiled a partnership with <span class="companylink">MUFG Union Bank</span>, No. 25 among American banks, that includes investing in loans and offering unsecured loans to Union Bank's mortgage customers via <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>'s platform. Though <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> aims ''to transform the banking system, we want banks to be part of the transformation and benefit from it,'' Mr. Laplanche said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behalf, formerly known as Zazma, was co-founded in 2011 by Benjy Feinberg, a 45-year-old South Africa native who studied in Israel and France before working briefly on Wall Street and helping found a telecom company in Eastern Europe. Typically charging 1 or 2 percent monthly interest but sometimes 3 percent, Behalf makes quick credit decisions by starting with a handful of information, including the business owner's name, address, email address and business address, then crunching data from social media and online sources. Behalf also reduces the loans' risk by directing payments to the borrower's vendors. The loans, of up to 120 days, thus cannot be used for nonbusiness purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feinberg said the <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> collaboration would enable Behalf to approach other vendors, at times with <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>, about offering credit to their customers. Rob Snyder, the <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> executive who arranged the Behalf collaboration, noted that business use of credit cards was growing at about 15 percent annually, while consumer card use was growing in the low single digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We look at alternative lenders as obvious potential disrupters of the business and, therefore, potential partners,'' Mr. Snyder said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed on Monday to modernize New York City's corporate tax code to allow the smallest companies to pay less and make it harder for large companies to evade city taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes would be similar in some ways to an overhaul of the state's corporate tax system that went into effect Jan. 1. But the mayor supplemented the statewide changes by reducing tax rates on the small businesses, which he hopes will grow and help offset the steady decline in jobs on Wall Street.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials projected that the full package of changes would not reduce the revenue collected from the city's various corporate taxes. As a bonus, they said, the changes might entice companies to move more of their operations to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crucial component of the proposal is for the city to treat all parts of a company as a whole, to make it more difficult for them to shift income from New York to places with lower tax rates, said Jacques Jiha, the commissioner of the city's Department of Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been the chief financial officer of a company, Mr. Jiha said, ''I know the kinds of things companies do in shifting income from high- to low-tax states.'' He said that using the ''unitary combination'' approach was the ''best tool we have available to us right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials hoped that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would include the proposed changes in the state budget and make them retroactive to Jan. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state decided last year to stop taxing banks and financial companies differently from other types of corporations. The biggest banks had complained that because they were taxed based on their assets and payroll in New York, they were punished for having such a large presence in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his proposal, Mr. de Blasio is suggesting that the city follow suit by merging the bank tax into the corporate tax. That move could cost the city about $324 million in annual revenue, so officials have looked for ways to offset that loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the shifts they devised was to raise the limit on how much of a corporation's capital base will be taxable. The net effect on most banks is expected to be negligible, but the changes should give them less incentive to move jobs out of the city, city officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another part of the proposal is for the city to tax companies that have little or no physical presence in New York based on how much of their sales are conducted in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Kellermann, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, expressed skepticism about the city's ability to gain as much as it would lose under the proposals. ''I'm concerned about covering the $300 million revenue loss from these other changes,'' Ms. Kellermann said. ''That has a way of not happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the proposals got positive reviews from both the business community, in the form of the Partnership for New York City, and labor unions, in the voice of James Parrott, an economist with the union-backed Fiscal Policy Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parrott said the proposal ''means that very large companies, whatever accounting maneuvers they undertake, will be paying a minimum, meaningful amount of tax. I think that's a very positive thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parrott, who is releasing a report on Tuesday proposing other changes in city tax policy, noted that the share of income taxes corporations pay has held steady in the city, while falling in the rest of the state. He said corporations have been contributing 13 to 15 percent of the income taxes collected by the city for the last 20 years. But their share of state income tax revenue has dropped to 8 percent from about 15 percent in a 25-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said: ''Mayor de Blasio's decision to conform the city's tax code to match state reforms promises to make the city more attractive for business investment and job creation, reinforcing New York's status as the global center of commerce and finance.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the hottest areas of finance these days is also one of the oldest: small-business lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With traditional banks constrained by regulations put in place since the financial crisis, alternative investment firms and technology start-ups are increasingly in the business of lending to companies. One new firm, MGG Investment Group, which is expected to make its official debut on Wednesday, has raised $200 million for a fund it will use to try to capture a slice of this market.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm, based in Manhattan, said it raised the capital from Frank H. McCourt Jr., the real estate developer who formerly owned the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Dodgers</span>. Although its loans will probably be more expensive than those from a traditional bank, MGG is hoping that its Wall Street expertise and a nimble approach can help it find business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, MGG has committed to five deals since starting last fall, said Kevin Griffin, the firm's chief executive, who formerly worked at big hedge funds. He said he planned to lend to companies with $10 million to $40 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks are still having a tremendously hard time lending to those types of businesses,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''I think it's only getting harder.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin, 38, has years of experience in debt markets. He formerly was a managing director and member of the credit committee of the hedge fund Highbridge Principal Strategies and previously held senior roles at the hedge funds Octavian Advisors and <span class="companylink">Fortress Investment Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has done several deals with Mr. McCourt over the years, he said, providing a portion of the financing to buy the Dodgers and then extending a loan when Mr. McCourt put the team into bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new firm's name is a combination of the initials of McCourt Global, Mr. McCourt's company, and Mr. Griffin. It currently has four investment professionals, Mr. Griffin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though banks may be retreating from this market, MGG is bound to have rivals. Hedge funds and private equity firms are doing more lending. One upstart lender, <span class="companylink">OnDeck Capital</span>, had its initial public offering in December.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norm Breyfogle, a comic book artist known for his work on Batman, found himself struggling after a stroke in December. He had no health insurance. He was partly paralyzed on his left side, unable to use his valuable drawing hand. And Mr. Breyfogle, 54, was in a nursing home in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, facing months of physical therapy.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried about his brother's rapidly rising bills, Kevin Breyfogle decided to step in. He started a crowdfunding campaign, which raises small donations from donors, on the site YouCaring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had to come up with something really quick,'' Kevin Breyfogle said, adding that crowdfunding worked better than he imagined. His crowdfunding team set a goal of $200,000 to pay for his brother's continuing care, raising $20,000 in the first day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more caregivers face paying for loved ones' unexpected out-of-pocket health care costs, they are turning to crowdfunding sites that focus on personal causes like Mr. Breyfogle's. Sites like <span class="companylink">GiveForward</span>, GoFundMe and Fundly have devoted sections to health expenses, including specific diseases like cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the crowdfunding powerhouse Indiegogo has stepped into the personal crowdfunding arena with its introduction of Indiegogo Life, which includes medical fund-raising, in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High out-of-pocket health expenses can quickly deplete a sick person's financial resources. According to a 2014 <span class="companylink">Commonwealth Fund</span> survey, 87 percent of people age 65 or older in the United States have at least one chronic illness. Despite Medicare coverage, though, older adults in the United States have more difficulty paying for their care than peers in other developed countries, mostly because of out-of-pocket costs and limits to care, the survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fill the void, crowdfunding sites are stepping in, with people posting requests for donations to pay for funerals, out-of-pocket medical expenses and, sometimes, interim nursing home care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago-based <span class="companylink">GiveForward</span>, for example, has helped raise $149 million for crowdfunding campaigns since starting in 2008, said Ethan Austin, the organization's president and co-founder. And most of the money goes to meet unexpected medical expenses, he said. ''No one should have to go through a difficult illness alone,'' he said, adding that more baby boomers are using it for parents' care. ''And giving someone the opportunity to help is a big gift.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Five years ago, no one would have crowdfunded expenses,'' Mr. Austin said. ''But there's a tidal shift coming as health care expenses rise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caregivers worry most about financial concerns, said Brooks Kenny, executive vice president at Lotsa Helping Hands, an organization that offers resources to caregivers and volunteers in the Washington area. So crowdfunding can be a powerful solution, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a mobile society, crowdfunding can cast a big virtual net. Buckley Fricker, a geriatric care manager and president of Buckley's for Seniors, which offers nonmedical care to older people, said Americans no longer lived in communities where everyone helped take care of a sick elder. In its place, technology can pull from all areas of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Technology is breaking down solid walls with virtual windows,'' Ms. Fricker said. ''And it can virtually recreate the family.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect to go back to the electronic money trough often, though. Fund-raising for unusual expenses works best, Ms. Fricker said. ''The need for geriatric care is so far and wide that it's hard to draw out interest,'' she said. So crowdfunding is more successful with extraordinary circumstances, such as Mr. Breyfogle's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Infinite dragging on of expenses won't garner support,'' Ms. Fricker said. People want to visualize the difference they're making, such as outfitting a home with an elevator or buying a new wheelchair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once there's a specific need, building a wide network is crucial. Don't just rely on the biggest and best crowdfunding sites to help you, Ms. Fricker advised, but use emails and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to pull in more donations. Mr. Breyfogle was able to draw on a fan base of 5,000 <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> friends, but having friends spread the word to other friends helps too, experts said. They can even be friends from clubs, churches or schools. ''Tap into your network communities where lots of people know each other,'' Ms. Kenny suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crowdfunding is never going to be a platform where millions give,'' explained Mr. Austin. ''Usually, 80 percent of the people who contribute are people you know rather than strangers. The key is getting people with big, active networks involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start the process with closest friends and family to build momentum, he suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And realize that people don't always contribute the first time you ask,'' he said. ''It may take three or four times of continued asking.'' Getting three or four people out of 100 to donate is a good rate, he said, adding that persistence is important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pataki family turned to their friends and family to help pay for a health expense gap after Marguerite Pataki, a 76-year-old California resident who had a stroke last summer, was placed in at-home care rather than a nursing home, which health insurance would have covered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Suddenly costs started snowballing,'' said Monica Pataki, Marguerite's daughter, who lives in Arizona. ''My dad was wading through a morass of bills and fees.'' And the Pataki children were quickly running out of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the family started a fund-raising campaign on <span class="companylink">GiveForward</span> in early December to raise $11,648 to pay for a caregiver and other expenses. ''Within 15 minutes we were set up online,'' Ms. Pataki said. ''Short of selling everything we have, this is the best thing we could come up with.'' To rev up the campaign, the Patakis sent out dozens of emails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the donors was Marlene Robinson, who lives in California and knows the Patakis. Ms. Robinson, who believes in paying favors forward, made a small donation. ''I want to support campaigns I resonate with,'' said Ms. Robinson, a self-employed inventor. ''It's about connecting with things that feed a purpose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking for small contributions increases the chances of getting participation, Ms. Fricker said, and the various crowdfunding sites usually allow donations starting at a dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of any good campaign is a compelling story, though. So adding lots of photos and detailed information about the loved one can increase donations, experts say. The Patakis ultimately added six more photos to their crowdfunding campaign page. Adding video, even taken with a cellphone, can add more personal color. ''You can raise 150 percent more with a video,'' said Danae Ringelmann, a co-founder of Indiegogo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older, less technologically adept donors may balk at giving money online, though. So the Patakis called some elderly family friends on the phone. ''Speaking to them works better,'' Ms. Pataki said. ''And they've been kind and sent checks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family had to overcome some discomfort about asking for money, Ms. Pataki acknowledged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're laying out your dirt online,'' she said. ''And it's humiliating.'' As the campaign evolved, however, the Patakis found that donors were touched by their mother's story rather than pitying their lack of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding can be an excellent way to bring in money that's tax-free. The I.R.S. treats these personal-cause donations as gifts for recipients, Mr. Austin noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fund-raisers may need to spend money to make money, though. Some personal crowdfunding sites charge fees for their services. <span class="companylink">GiveForward</span>, for example, charges a 7.9 percent fee plus 50 cents per donation transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Breyfogle, though, crowdfunding has become the difference between hope and despair. Although the campaign continues for another month, ''I don't feel that I'm in dire financial straits anymore,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large telecommunications companies have repeatedly taken advantage of rules meant to help small, rural, female- and minority-owned businesses buy licenses for airwaves for wireless phone and data transmission, including in a recent auction that raised nearly $45 billion for the government. Congress and the <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span> should crack down on such abuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest auction, two ''small'' businesses in which <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span>, the satellite-TV company, owns 85 percent of the stock could be entitled to as much as $3 billion in discounts on winning bids totaling about $13 billion. The discounts, which have to be ratified by the F.C.C., are meant to make it easier for small businesses to enter the wireless industry. But the idea that a start-up could break into this business, which requires millions, if not billions, in investment is misconceived.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dish Network</span>, which is not currently in the wireless business but is expected to enter it, is not the first large company to find a way to claim such benefits. <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>, which dominate the cellphone business, have done the same thing in past auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the F.C.C.'s two Republican commissioners, Ajit Pai, says the agency should investigate <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span> to see if the company has broken any rules; he also wants the commission to change its procedures for future auctions. For its part, <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span> says that it has fully followed rules approved unanimously by the five-member commission. If that's true, then the rules need to be changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1993, Congress instructed the F.C.C. to create an auction system that gives a leg up to certain kinds of businesses, including small and rural firms and minority-owned businesses. So the commission created rules to provide discounts of up to 25 percent to bidders that fit those criteria. But because wireless frequencies, also known as spectrum, is expensive, the commission allows companies that qualify for discounts to be owned or financed by larger businesses. For example, the winning bid submitted by one of the <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span>-affiliated firms, Northstar Wireless, for a license covering New York and Newark was $829 million, but the company will pay $621 million if the commission decides that it deserves a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a clear public interest in making sure valuable wireless frequencies are not controlled by one or a handful of large corporations. Congress and the F.C.C., for example, could impose caps on how much spectrum any one company and its affiliates can acquire through auctions or by merging with each other. Such an approach would limit the concentration of power in a few hands without allowing big companies to essentially claim to be start-ups by bidding through affiliated businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To its credit, the commission is trying to introduce more competition in the wireless industry. Chairman Tom Wheeler has proposed that an upcoming auction include a provision that would set aside some spectrum for companies that do not control a significant number of similar wireless frequencies. That should help smaller wireless businesses get the airwaves they need to compete against giants like <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> and <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just four national cellphone companies controlling about 98 percent of the market, Congress and the commission need to do more to encourage competition in the wireless industry. They can start by cutting off subsidies to corporations that don't need the help.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- When Arnaud Bertrand helped found HouseTrip, a vacation rental website, in 2009, his goal was to build a rival in Europe to <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, which was then a year-old start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From offices in central London -- equipped with game tables and colorful photos of European cities -- HouseTrip quickly raised almost $60 million from private investors, expanded to more than 30 countries and hired over 100 people, from London to Lisbon. The aim was to connect travelers with people looking to rent out their homes.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The focus from Day 1 has been Europe,'' said Mr. Bertrand, 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the last six years, HouseTrip has found itself in an increasing struggle to compete with <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, which has become the global leader in short-term rentals. And like many other European start-ups trying to compete against bigger American rivals with international ambitions, HouseTrip is having to adapt its business model. It is now trying to mine smaller markets, rather than compete head-on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There might be any number of explanations for <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>'s rapid ascent -- management prowess, savvy marketing or a better stable of available properties. But there has been one clear, made-in-the U.S.A. advantage: funding, and lots of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, based in San Francisco, had early and ample access to venture capitalists in nearby Silicon Valley, including Sequoia Capital. Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, also bought in. So far, <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> has raised almost $800 million in funding, giving the company a valuation of about $13 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is that kind of money that enables American start-ups to almost immediately pursue global ambitions, taking on and often besting European and other international competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another San Francisco native, the ride-booking company Uber, has raised nearly $5 billion, much of it from American wealth funds. The money has given six-year-old Uber a valuation of $41.2 billion and helped propel it to global -- if often controversial -- prominence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Snapchat, a mobile photo-messaging service founded by students at <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span> (in the heart of Silicon Valley), has raised roughly $650 million in private funding, enabling it to expand rapidly in Europe, Asia and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a much better awareness by U.S. start-ups about the importance of global expansion,'' said Eileen Burbidge, a partner at the London-based venture firm Passion Capital, who previously worked at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and Skype.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the United States economy bounces back from the financial crisis, the funding gap with Europe -- struggling to avoid recession -- has only grown. No wonder many European tech entrepreneurs are now trying to adapt -- by giving their start-ups a more local focus or trying to carve out a market niche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HouseTrip, for instance, has pulled back from many of its European markets to focus primarily on France and Britain, which represented the bulk of bookings. It has also targeted families who are looking for vacation rentals of a week or longer, forgoing the larger short-term rental market where <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> dominates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And recognizing that HouseTrip needed a change at the top, Mr. Bertrand stepped down as chief executive last year. He remains a major shareholder and has taken the title of president. But he handed the reins to George Hadjigeorgiou, the start-up's former chief operating officer, who had previously worked at <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's early in the game, and we had to focus,'' Mr. Hadjigeorgiou said. ''<span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> is educating people about our market. We still can be successful by focusing on family vacations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other European start-ups also have changed their strategies in response to American rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hailo, a British ride-booking service similar to Uber, based on a smartphone app, recently abandoned its United States ambitions and is trying to protect its strength in places like London, where the app has established itself with the city's taxi drivers. Hailo, which has raised roughly $100 million since being founded in 2010, including money from the billionaire British entrepreneur Richard Branson, also targeted Asian cities like Singapore and Osaka, Japan, where Uber has yet to cement its dominance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Hailo's financing indicates, European start-ups are not necessarily impoverished. And some, like Spotify, the music streaming service, and Mojang, the Swedish company behind the Minecraft game that was recently acquired by <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> for $2.5 billion, have become global champions in their own right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, whether in the converted warehouses of East London, the bohemian lofts of Berlin, or the Ikea-furnished offices of downtown Stockholm, European companies have been receiving more venture capital than ever before. European start-ups raised about $7.6 billion last year, a 41 percent leap over 2013, according to the data provider <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> VentureSource.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was only about one-fifth the amount raised by American technology companies, which secured a combined $37.9 billion in 2014, up more than 30 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this year is off to a such roaring start for American tech financing that some experts are warning of a potential bubble. In January, Uber announced that it had raised yet another round, receiving $1.6 billion from clients of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>'s private wealth unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The world has changed beyond compare when someone like Uber can raise a couple of billion dollars almost overnight,'' said Sonali de Rycker, a London-based partner at the venture firm <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>. ''Competition has never been so fierce.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, European entrepreneurs have brought the American onslaught upon themselves. United States entrepreneurs once saw international expansion as secondary to domestic growth. But the rise of copycat companies around the world has spurred the Americans to spend internationally before local rivals can become entrenched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you've got a business that works, you have to go global as quickly as possible,'' said Ben Holmes, a partner at <span class="companylink">Index Ventures</span>, which has backed the likes of San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span>, the file-sharing service now valued at about $10 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Florian Meissner, a German entrepreneur, trying to duplicate the offering of a big American rival was never the idea. EyeEm, a Berlin-based mobile photo app that he helped found, works similarly to Instagram, but is aimed at a narrower audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Meissner sees it, Instagram, which was acquired by <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> for $1 billion in 2012, is a service people use to upload photos from their children's birthday parties. EyeEm, which started in 2011, has tailored its app for serious photographers, who want to share professional-quality photos on their smartphones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opportunity is certainly smaller. EyeEm says its user numbers are only about one-twentieth the size of Instagram's 300 million global users. But by focusing on a niche, Mr. Meissner says the German start-up has built a loyal following among photo-savvy users and avoided becoming a mere Instagram copycat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EyeEm's high-quality images also led to a deal with <span class="companylink">Getty Images</span> last year in which people's smartphone photos were included in the company's collection of stock images. EyeEm, which now employs a total of 55 people -- divided between Berlin and San Francisco -- takes a percentage of the royalty paid for each image used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would never have tried to build something similar to Instagram,'' said Mr. Meissner, adding that most European start-ups will find it hard to compete directly with better-financed American rivals. ''If you are running a taxi app in Austria, I would just stop,'' he said. ''Uber is coming after you.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDWhat's new this tax season? In a word: Obamacare. That's the answer given by many tax professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who overcame the challenges of Healthcare.gov and succeeded in buying health insurance under the Affordable Care Act last year now face a new set of hurdles in the form of daunting tax forms. So do business owners who offer coverage to employees under the law's Small Business Health Options Program. But the good news for both is that they may receive a tax credit that reduces taxes dollar for dollar.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Weltman, a lawyer in Vero Beach, Fla., and the author of ''J.K. Lasser's 1001 Deductions &amp; Tax Breaks 2015,'' said it could be a big credit if you qualify for it, but warned, ''It is not that easy to qualify.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For qualifying business owners the credit for 2014 is 50 percent, up from 35 percent in 2013. Individuals who bought insurance through an exchange and had household income between $11,490 and $45,960 last year may be able to claim a tax credit on the new Form 8962.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people estimated their income when they bought their coverage and received an advance on the credit in the form of payments directly to their insurance company. Now that the income numbers are real, taxpayers may get a refund -- or may owe the government more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is extremely complicated,'' Ms. Weltman said, referring to the form and the instructions for filling it out. She recommended using tax software with interview questions rather than trying to fill out the form by hand based on the official instructions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with incomes below $60,000 qualify for the ''Free File'' program, in which the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> teams up with various software providers. Information is available at irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, the maker of TurboTax software, offers free assistance at TurboTaxHealth.com to help people determine if they are eligible for low-cost health insurance and what the tax penalty will be if they have not bought it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most taxpayers -- those with employer-provided health insurance or Medicare or Medicaid -- do not have to fill out any complicated forms. All they have to do is check a box on the Form 1040. A third group of people qualify for exemption from coverage, and they need to fill out Form 8965. More information is available at irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5201.pdf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large employers are required to report health insurance coverage on employee W-2 forms for 2014, but that shouldn't cause any problems. ''Don't worry,'' Ms. Weltman said. ''It's not taxable'' to employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Identity Theft</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Identity theft is not limited to stealing credit card data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thieves also use stolen Social Security numbers to file returns and claim refunds, generally early in the filing season. And the I.R.S. said last month that trying to stop this kind of theft is a top priority. It opened 1,063 identity theft investigations last year, it said, and that led to 748 sentences imposed in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., said taxpayers could protect themselves from identity thieves by filing a new Form W-4 with employers and keeping close tabs on quarterly payments of estimated taxes so that they have a balance due, not a refund, when they file their tax returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you file a return claiming a refund and the I.R.S. says, 'We've already received a return claiming a refund and paid it,' they will investigate,'' Mr. Block said. ''Eventually you'll get your refund, but it could be a considerable time. If you have a balance due and send in a check, if the I.R.S. has already sent a refund, they'll have to sort that out, but you won't have a problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax professionals have long recommended that taxpayers limit withholding to avoid big refunds simply because too much withholding amounts to giving the Treasury an interest-free loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Job Hunt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job search expenses may provide a tax deduction for some people. After all, the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent at the end of last year from 9.9 percent five years earlier, and that surely reflects a lot of job searches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, many searchers may not qualify for a deduction, said Greg Rosica, a contributing author to the ''EY Tax Guide 2015,'' published by Wiley, and a tax partner at <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>. Mr. Rosica, who leads the firm's southeast area private client services practice in Tampa, Fla., gave three reasons that would bar many job seekers from claiming a deduction:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; These expenses are classified as ''miscellaneous itemized deductions,'' which can be taken only if the total exceeds 2 percent of adjusted gross income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Online job searches these days do not generate all of the travel and printing expenses that seekers used to rack up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; The new job must be in the same field as one's previous employment. Many people change fields to land a new job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course job seekers who meet all the qualifications -- perhaps paying for outplacement counseling, travel and other costs -- may claim the deduction, even if their searches were not successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Sales Taxes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State income taxes may be deducted on your federal tax forms, but Mr. Rosica said that for residents of some states, it may be worth considering whether to deduct state sales taxes instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may be done on Schedule A, and for people in states like Florida and Texas that do not have a state income tax, deducting sales taxes makes a great deal of sense. It may also be the right thing to do for people in other states who have bought a big-ticket item like a car in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may also make sense for retirees because many states give tax breaks for Social Security, retirement account distributions and pensions, thus lowering adjusted gross income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extra Medical Expenses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Affordable Care Act hasn't changed one reality: Health insurance doesn't take care of all medical expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Block pointed out that such unreimbursed expenses are still deductible -- but only when they exceed certain thresholds. For most people, it is 10 percent of adjusted gross income -- but it is 7.5 percent for people 65 or older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of hearing aids and dental care, private-duty nursing, travel to and from medical appointments, including tolls and parking, are frequently not reimbursed and are eligible for inclusion as deductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volunteers, in a hospital or as a delegate to a religious convention for example, may also incur deductible expenses for travel, meals and other out-of-pocket costs, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping Good Records</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mileage deductions vary, depending on your reason for getting on the road. The I.R.S. allows 56 cents a mile for unreimbursed business miles last year, 23.5 cents a mile for medical or moving purposes and 14 cents a mile for charitable use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping good records is the key to being able to claim deductions of many sorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to help is to use a designated credit card for any outlay that may be deductible, Mr. Rosica said, and then go online to get an end-of-year report from the card issuer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brittney <span class="companylink">Saks</span>, the United States personal financial services leader for <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, pointed out that most deductions need third-party documentation, like a Form 1098 from a bank reporting mortgage interest, or a receipt from a charity for contributions above $250, but the travel and out-of-pocket charitable expenses depend on personal records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people overlook these deductions because of the bother of having to always carry a journal to jot them down. But most of us carry a smartphone, which can be used to take notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no specific requirement for how to keep records, Ms. <span class="companylink">Saks</span> said. The important thing is to note the expenses as they are incurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another area where record-keeping is important, she said, is investments. When a holding is sold, for example, both the cost basis and the sale price and the date of each must be reported to determine whether the taxpayer has a gain or loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your brokerage firm or fund company may provide that information, but you may need to go over your own records to be sure the data is accurate, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under current rules, if the asset sold is an inherited one, Mr. Block said, its basis is not the original owner's cost but its value on that owner's day of death. If the inheritance is a publicly traded stock, the day-of-death value is easily obtained. The value of other assets -- collectibles, real estate, artwork -- may be more difficult to determine, but determining that value could bring big tax savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say a man inherited a family home in 2014 from a parent who died in 2013. It may have cost $50,000 in 1970 and risen to 10 or 12 times that much by 2013, then risen just a few thousand more by 2014, when the son sold it. The son is liable for taxes on the relatively small gain in value after he inherited the house, not on the big gains that occurred in previous years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family matters can be important for current returns and for future tax planning. Sidney Kess, a certified public accountant and lawyer with Kostelanetz &amp; Fink in New York, gave several examples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one, a widower who lived alone filed as single, but in late 2013 his daughter's marriage broke up, and she and her three children moved in with him. It was intended as a temporary move but lasted all last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He can file as head of household and claim them as dependents because he provided more than half their support. That will substantially reduce his taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kess also pointed out that alimony is deductible by the payer, who must report the recipient's name and Social Security number. The recipient must report alimony received as income, and a recipient who fails to do so is inviting trouble from the I.R.S., Mr. Kess said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many affluent people help adult children or grandchildren financially. Rather than writing a check, they should consider giving appreciated or dividend-paying stocks, Mr. Kess suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That can help the recipients because long-term capital gains and dividends are tax-free for people in the 10 percent and 15 percent tax brackets. Any individual can give up to $14,000 each (that is $28,000 for a couple) to as many people as they like with no gift tax consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such gifts can also be a big tax saver for owners of incorporated small businesses, who can give shares in it to family members and set the size of any dividends they pay. They may use the gifts as a long-term estate-planning strategy to transfer assets to adult children. That is a complicated matter that needs individual tax advice from an expert in trusts and estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: February 22, 2015, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the special Your Taxes section last Sunday about tips to avoid pitfalls in preparing 2014 tax returns misstated the downside of excess withholding. It amounts to an interest-free loan to the Treasury, not a tax-free loan.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDCharles W. Ergen, the billionaire who controls the satellite TV provider <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span>, and his company are about to make a cool $3.25 billion -- courtesy of the American taxpayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This windfall came from a recent successful auction of wireless spectrum that raised more than $40 billion for the American treasury. But it will be $3.25 billion less than it ought to be, if Mr. Ergen and his clever lawyers have their way.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason is that <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span> bid for licenses through a newly formed vehicle that claimed to be a ''very small business'' under the <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span> rules and was entitled to a 25 percent discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point you may be scratching your head. How can Dish, a company with a $34 billion market value, be a ''very small business''? Indeed, to qualify for the discount, a very small business must have revenue not ''exceeding $15 million for the preceding three years.'' Dish in its last full fiscal year had almost $14 billion in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through sleight of hand and aggressive use of partners and loopholes, Dish turned itself into that very small business, distorting reality and creating an unfair advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is how it worked for $7.8 billion of Dish's winning bids (it had $13 billion in winning bids in all).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new company, Northstar Wireless, was formed to bid on the spectrum. <span class="companylink">Dish Network Corporation</span> indirectly owns 85 percent of Northstar Wireless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a new company is not enough. After all, anyone could then simply form a new company and save similar billions of dollars. In its rules, the F.C.C. counts the revenue of affiliates and the controlling owners of the bidding entity for purposes of determining whether a business is a very small one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first loophole, the lawyers went to Alaska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doyon is an Alaska Native regional corporation, created as part of a federal government settlement of native land claims back in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based in Fairbanks, Alaska, Doyon has more than ''19,000 shareholders, and is the largest private landowner in Alaska,'' according to its website. It has at least 12 different operating companies, including one that operates seven drilling rigs on the Alaskan North Shore. It purpose is to serve the Native American community in central Alaska, and its shareholders are all Native American descendants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doyon owns 15 percent of Northstar, a stake it acquired for $120 million; Mr. Ergen's Dish owns the other 85 percent. Even though Dish is the majority owner, Doyon was designated as the manager of Northstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doyon's control over Northstar is the key to the small-business discount. Dish contends that it lacks control -- Doyon has all the votes -- and so its own revenue is not included in calculating whether Northstar is a very small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, you may be wondering how Doyon itself can qualify as a ''very small firm.'' After all, being the largest landowner in Alaska and an owner of oil rigs must count for something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And indeed, Doyon's average annual profit over the last five years has been more than $18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It comes down to what may be the most obscure exemption in the F.C.C. rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are regulations specifically for the dozen or so companies organized under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. For them and other Indian tribes, the agency does not count the revenue from ''entities owned and controlled by such tribes or corporations'' unless the revenue comes from gambling. And so only Doyon -- the holding company -- is counted, and it has no revenue for these purposes because all of its money was made in its other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, Dish has erected an edifice that it used to reap that $3.25 billion in savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this point, your head may be exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rest of Dish's winning bids -- worth about $5.5 billion -- were done under a partnership with John Muleta, the former chief of the F.C.C.'s wireless telecommunications bureau, and relied on similar loopholes. As a former government official, Mr. Muleta has no real revenue and so meets the test of being a ''very small business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No doubt Dish and its lawyers are high-fiving one another and patting themselves on the back. By giving 15 percent ownership to Doyon at a discounted price, they have saved themselves billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers, however, may want to ponder what those billions of dollars could have done in the coffers of the government -- a new bridge or money for schools, perhaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this is not a new issue. The ''small firm'' exemption has been known to be a problem at the F.C.C. for years. The <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> in 2005 wrote a report highlighting how it was used mostly by big companies instead of the small firms it was intended to benefit. Moreover, the office found that the program provided little benefit to consumers while providing a big discount to companies. In a 2006 auction, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> successfully used this structure with Doyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest spectrum auction -- and the attention it has received -- may finally push the F.C.C. to eliminate this exemption. It's hard to see how it benefits anyone but Dish and Doyon, which both get free money for not doing much of anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More immediately, the agency should take a good, hard look at the structure of the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doyon has control over Northstar in its day-to-day operations, but the agreements also require Northstar to be managed according to a five-year business plan agreed to by Dish in advance. No deviation in any material respect can be made without Dish's approval through a subsidiary. Not only that, but there is a multipage list of things that Northstar cannot do without approval from Dish's subsidiary. These restrictions include spending more than $2 million, selling the company or paying any executive more than $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given Dish's significant control and the requirement that Doyon cannot deviate from a previously agreed business plan, Dish is having its discount but still getting effective control. Though the F.C.C. may have passed on this issue without scrutiny before, this instance would seem to provide grounds to challenge the exemption claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a blog post after the auction, Roger C. Sherman, the current chief of the F.C.C.'s wireless telecommunications bureau, wrote that the agency would ''thoroughly review and scrutinize each application'' to make sure it ''has complied with the commission's bidding credit rules.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ajit Pai, an F.C.C. commissioner, followed up by saying that Dish's bid made a ''mockery'' of the exemption and called for further investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dish has been busy trying to defend itself, arguing in a presentation to the agency that this program ''helps increase auction revenue'' by allowing more parties to bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to laugh, because even if true, this credit was never intended to help companies like Dish bid and earn them billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Muleta has turned into a very rich man overnight. Doyon put up only $120 million and now owns 15 percent of an entity worth almost $8 billion. Mr. Ergen, who is worth more than $22 billion, according to Forbes, is even richer. If the F.C.C. wants to encourage more bidders, it would seem that other, fairer ways are possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Doyon defended the strategy, saying its participation in the auction helped push up the prices ''three times more than was expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We followed the designated entity ('D.E.') program rules and did what Congress intended: create competition,'' Aaron M. Schutt, the president and chief executive of Doyon, said in the statement. ''By any measure, the D.E. program delivers solid value for the American taxpayer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Muleta did not respond to an email request for comment. A representative of Dish directed me to a conference call with analysts earlier this week in which Mr. Ergen argued that Dish ''went by the rules'' and that by bidding, it created more value for the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an era when banks and oil companies are at times publicly vilified as not being good corporate citizens, Dish's strategy for the spectrum auction comes across as among the most brazen, least civic-minded act by a corporation in years. The involvement and enrichment of Mr. Muleta, a former government official, only makes it worse. Manipulating the system this way may win points with shareholders and lawyers, but it will serve only to fuel the public's cynicism over large corporations and government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: February 26, 2015, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Deal Professor column on Wednesday, about <span class="companylink">Dish Network</span>'s bidding for wireless spectrum, misidentified the company that created Northstar Wireless, an affiliate of Dish, to participate in the auction. It is Doyon, which owns 15 percent of Northstar -- not Dish, which indirectly owns 85 percent.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDHVIDOVRE, Denmark -- At first, Eva Christiansen barely noticed the number. Her bank called to say that Ms. Christiansen, a 36-year-old entrepreneur here, had been approved for a small-business loan. She whooped. She danced. A friend took pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think I was so happy I got the loan, I didn't hear everything he said,'' she recalled.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then she was told again about her interest rate. It was -0.0172 percent -- less than zero. While there would be fees to pay, the bank would also pay interest to her. It was just a little over $1 a month, but still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are strange times for European borrowers, as if a wormhole has opened up to a parallel universe where the usual rules of financial gravity are suspended. Investors lent Germany nearly $4 billion this week, knowing they would not be fully repaid. Bonds issued by the Swiss candy maker <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> recently traded in the market for more than they will ever be worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such topsy-turvy deals reflect the dark outlook for the region's economy, as policy makers do whatever they can to revive growth, even taking interest rates below zero to encourage borrowing (and spending). In this environment, the simplest of banking tasks have become a curiosity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer loans and mortgages with interest rates that are outright negative remain rare, and Ms. Christiansen appears to be one of the few who actually received one while banks mull how to proceed. Some other Danes are getting charged to park their money in their bank accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such financial episodes are taking place all across Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To breathe life into Europe's economy and stoke inflation, policy makers recently resorted to a drastic measure tried by some other central banks. The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>, which dictates policy in the 19-member eurozone, announced a plan that involves printing money to buy hundreds of billions of euros of government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just the anticipation of the program prompted bond prices to soar and the euro to drop in value. Other countries that do not use the euro were then forced to take defensive countermeasures to keep a lid on the value of their currencies, encourage lending and bolster growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switzerland, for instance, jettisoned its currency's peg to the euro, shocking markets, and cut interest rates further below zero. <span class="companylink">Denmark's central bank</span> has reduced rates four times in a month, to minus 0.75 percent. Sweden followed suit earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most profound changes are taking place in Europe's bond market, which has been turned into something of a charity, at least for certain borrowers. The latest example came on Wednesday, when Germany issued a five-year bond worth nearly $4 billion, with a negative interest rate. Investors were essentially agreeing to be paid back slightly less money than they lent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonds issued by Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Finland and even fiscally challenged Italy also have negative yields. Right now, roughly $1.75 trillion in bonds issued by countries in the eurozone are trading with negative yields, which is equivalent to more than a quarter of the total government bonds, according to an analysis by <span class="companylink">ABN Amro</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason investors are willing to tolerate such yields is the relative safety of the bonds, in a weak economy. Traders are also betting that the prices of the bonds will keep going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some corporate bonds, which are generally deemed less creditworthy than government bonds, are falling into the negative territory, including some issued by <span class="companylink">Nestlé</span> and <span class="companylink">Novartis</span>, a Swiss pharmaceutical company. While they did not initially have negative yields, investors bid up their prices after they were issued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime and once-in-history phenomenon,'' said Heather L. Loomis, a managing director at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Private Bank</span>, who specializes in bonds, ''and it is hard to make sense of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can be especially hard for people who are not bankers. Ms. Christiansen, a sex therapist, took out a loan to finance a website called LoveShack that is part matchmaking site, part social network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For her, the full novelty of her loan didn't sink in until a spokeswoman for the bank called her back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She said, 'Hi, Eva, they have contacted us from TV 2' -- it's a big station in Denmark, one of the biggest -- 'and they would like to talk to you because of this loan,''' Ms. Christiansen said. ''Then I was really like, 'O.K., this is big.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she was generally aware of what the <span class="companylink">Danish central bank</span> was doing, but fuzzy on the specifics and had not paid close attention to the issue until she realized she might be asked about it in front of a camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I was contacted by the television, I was like, 'O.K., I need to know something,''' she said, laughing, during an interview at her office, where two distant windmills were visible outside the windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So I actually called my bank adviser and said, 'Can we please have a meeting?' Because all these financial terms, I'm not used to them,'' she said. ''If I talk about something, I'd like to know something about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other Danes are facing a related, if somewhat opposite, issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Ida Mottelson, a 27-year-old student, received an email from her bank telling her that it would start charging her one-half of 1 percent to hold her money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At first I thought I had misunderstood this, but I hadn't,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mottelson is studying for a master's degree in health sciences, and lives in Odense, a city about 100 miles west of Copenhagen. She said she had been following the news about the central bank, but called her own bank just to make sure she was reading the email correctly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I asked him super-naïvely, 'Can you explain this to me?' And he tried, but I got the feeling he was like, come on, just move the money and you'll be fine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She does plan to move her money to another bank. And there are signs that such practices are spreading to the United States. This week, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> said it would start charging some institutional clients to hold their money, because of a combination of new regulations and low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are now pondering some of the odd things that might occur if interest rates stay negative for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies and individuals may start to hoard cash outside of ordinary banks if the banks start to effectively charge substantial sums to hold deposits. Large savers, for instance, may choose to put their money in special institutions that do little more than warehouse their cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is some negative interest rate at which it would become profitable to stockpile cash,'' said James McAndrews, an economist at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>. He said that economists had speculated that such cash hoarding might begin once interest rates were around minus 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most people not poring over the financial pages, it can all seem a bit strange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not an expert,'' Ms. Mottelson said, ''but to me it sounds so weird that you have to pay to have your account at a bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: March 4, 2015, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about negative interest rates in Europe misstated the effect on European bond prices as a result of the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s decision to purchase hundreds of billions of euros' worth of bonds.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is Square?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-year-old payments start-up began by offering small, square-shaped credit card readers that plug into smartphones or tablets. The device helps small businesses easily accept credit card payments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Square has shifted its identity in the last year. In May, the company introduced Square Capital, a money lending program for small businesses that use Square. The company has promoted Square Cash, the smartphone app that lets users freely send money to one another's debit accounts. And on Monday, the company will introduce two services -- instant deposits and protection for disputed purchases -- that Square says will make life easier for small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These moves all speak to how Square now wishes to be known: as a company building services for small businesses, buttressed by the huge amount of data collected from the millions of credit card swipes it processes daily. Whether the company will rise or fall largely rests on whether those services attract new customers, all while keeping the old ones happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a huge competitive advantage,'' said Roelof Botha, a Square board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, a leading venture capital firm that has invested in the company. ''No one else has the kind of visibility we have into how these businesses that use Square are doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company says it always had a focus on data. But for a time, Square was far more concentrated on consumer-facing products like Square Wallet, which simply required customers to give a merchant their name to pay for items. Square Market, too, made it easy for businesses to create an online storefront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach, championed largely by Jack Dorsey, Square's co-founder and chief executive, did not work. Square has now moved projects like Wallet and Market to the back burner, according to two people briefed on the company's business plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you see with Wallet is us acknowledging that people don't really have a payments problem,'' said Sarah Friar, Square's chief financial officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitalizing on its wealth of transaction data may be the best way for Square to live up to its $6 billion valuation. Critics have said that Square's payments business is rife with problems; the margins are too thin, they say, or new customers are too expensive to acquire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Square faces pressure to compete with other companies like <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, <span class="companylink">First Data</span> and Amazon, all of which offer their own credit card readers and accompanying services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of Verifone, the giant point-of-sale hardware manufacturer that once offered a competing Square-like device, called the small-merchant payments business ''fundamentally unprofitable'' shortly before dropping its card reader product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many large companies that serve small businesses feel the same way, says James Wester, research director of global payments at IDC, a research firm. ''To do it well, you have to have a huge volume of merchants using your service and a lot of money to get it off the ground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Square has the money part covered: To date, it has raised more than half a billion dollars in venture capital. And it has had some success signing up merchants, too. Square says it serves ''millions'' of small and midsize business, and it processed over $30 billion in payments in 2014, growing 50 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company takes about 2.75 to 3 percent from each payment it processes, but must split that with credit card companies and other financial institutions. Square sees approximately 34 percent gross margin after paying these institutions, according to a person briefed on Square's business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Square needs far more customers to grow beyond its valuation, and will have to continue aggressively expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is where the company's data-driven merchant services come in, like Square Capital. The service is essentially a cash-advance business, one where Square sends out offers of small capital extensions -- usually $4,000 to $10,000 -- to small businesses that use Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offers are made based on data analysis behind the scenes. The company takes the information gathered from its payment processing to understand how a particular business operates, and to determine whether it is a strong candidate for an advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Square does well on each advance. Customers pay Square back at a fixed cost, adding 10 to 14 percent of the amount borrowed. Square also earns fees from a partner, Victory Park Capital, for finding and serving the clients. So far, Square said it had extended more than $100 million in capital to more than 20,000 merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are the people who cannot get bank loans, and for whatever reason they're not treated like a real business,'' Ms. Friar said. ''There's an absolute market opportunity for us here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Square also offers ancillary data-driven products created for small businesses. The new instant deposit product, which is still in testing and will be fully available in the spring, will give businesses faster access to money they put into a debit account. And the company's new charge-back protection service will cover some disputes between consumers and merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those products also rely on data that Square has collected. They will be available only to small businesses that have a solid financial track record, based on a history of accepting payments with Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the company is expected to focus even more on data-driven products. The Square Cash app, for example, could offer new insights because it gives Square data on how people exchange money with one another. Square does not charge users to send money with the app, though Ms. Friar said it might ultimately find ways to make money from Square merchants who could accept money through it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also Caviar, the start-up that Square acquired last year for around $90 million, which brings delivery services to restaurants that do not otherwise offer them. Square believes it can approach popular restaurants with the promise of aiding in delivery, and then potentially persuade those businesses to use more of Square's products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So again: What is Square?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company will say it is the same thing it always has been -- at least, sort of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would still define us as primarily a payments business,'' said Mr. Botha, the venture capitalist and Square board member. ''I just think that the term 'payments business' has changed from what it meant in the past.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has become a familiar pattern: The computer system of a big American company is breached, the personal information of tens of millions of customers is stolen and a public outcry ensues. Rarely are the thieves caught.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last summer's attack on <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> -- which resulted in hackers gaining access to email addresses and phone numbers for 83 million households and small businesses -- may break that pattern of investigative dead ends in large corporate breaches.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal authorities investigating the attack at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> are increasingly confident that a criminal case will be filed against the hackers in the coming months, said people briefed on the investigation. Law enforcement officials believe that several of the suspects are ''gettable,'' meaning that they live in a country with which the United States has an extradition treaty. That would not include countries like Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indictments and arrests would be a notable victory for the <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span> and Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. In contrast, there have been no criminal charges in a December 2013 breach at Target, where payment card data for 40 million customers was stolen, along with the personal information of 70 million customers, or in the major attacks against <span class="companylink">eBay</span> and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> involving hundreds of millions more customers last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the breach at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> did not result in the loss of customer money or the theft of personal information, it was one of the largest such attacks against a bank and a warning sign that the American financial system was vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials with the F.B.I. and Mr. Bharara's office declined to comment on the investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> case is advancing quickly partly because the attack was not nearly as sophisticated as initially believed, and law enforcement authorities were able to identify at least some suspects early on, said the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition they not be named because they were not authorized to discuss the case. Law enforcement officials also made the investigation a top priority given that the <span class="companylink">Department of Homeland Security</span> has declared the banking system critical infrastructure, requiring additional protection from digital attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> investigation is being handled at the highest levels of law enforcement, with the F.B.I. in New York assigning several senior agents to the matter along with a top prosecutor with the computer crimes division of Mr. Bharara's office, the people briefed on the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Brown, a senior managing director with <span class="companylink">FTI Consulting</span> and a former chief of the computer and intellectual property crime unit for Mr. Bharara, said law enforcement tends to aggressively pursue cases where it has a better chance of sending a message of deterrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The government has finite resources to deal with cybercrime and as a result tends to look for cases which can create maximum impact,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intensifying hunt for the <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> hackers comes as the bank, which has said it spends about $250 million a year on digital security and plans on doubling that in the future, wrestles every day with securing its vast global network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An internal assessment of the bank's security found that by the end of 2014 the bank had made ''significant progress'' in reducing ''severe patch issues'' in its digital network, but still had critical issues to address. The January report to the bank's cybersecurity business control committee -- a copy of which was reviewed by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> -- also noted that one server did not have the latest antivirus protection, but that it was being upgraded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patching holes in the bank's network is critical because hackers exploited such vulnerabilities to gain access to <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> in the first place. Attackers breached a server that had not been upgraded with so-called two-factor authentication, <span class="companylink">The Times</span> previously reported. Double authentication schemes, which are now considered industry standard, require a second, one-time password for employees to gain access to a secure system. Without that second password requirement, hackers were able to breach a server using the stolen login credentials for a bank employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once inside, hackers gained high-level access to more than 90 servers, but they were stopped before they could move customers' financial information to their servers abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The internal review also noted that <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> recently increased its requirements for giving people the highest level of access to the bank's network. It did so, according to the review, to minimize the risk of ''catastrophic technical or reputational damage to the firm.'' <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> now limits so-called ''high security access'' to bank employees who must submit to annual credit screenings and criminal background checks. The bank now also conducts a ''routine review'' to make sure that high security access is justified for a particular person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal authorities said the lack of prosecutions in big breach cases is often a reflection of the fact that the attackers are cloistered away in countries where the ability to make arrests is limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the Justice Department indicted five members of China's People's Liberation Army in connection with hacking attacks. None have been apprehended. And in December, the White House took the unusual step of identifying, and pledging retaliation against, North Korea for a destructive attack at <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Pictures, without filing a criminal case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bad news is that many of these folks are located overseas, and they are using encryption and servers all over the world,'' said Leslie R. Caldwell, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division at the Justice Department. ''But the good news is if we are able to jump on the breach early enough, we have an electronic trail and can get that evidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, hackers also wait before they use the data they steal to evade detection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen them steal and then store or secrete the data for long periods of time,'' said Joseph M. Demarest, the assistant director of the F.B.I.'s cyber division. ''We see them evolve their skills and trade craft and monetizing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal authorities have had some successes. One of the more notable was the successful prosecution of Albert Gonzalez for a string of hackings that netted more than 90 million credit and debit card numbers from TJ Maxx, <span class="companylink">Heartland Payment Systems</span> and other companies between 2005 and 2008. Mr. Gonzalez was convicted and sentenced to more than 20 years in prison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Gonzalez was living in the United States, while many digital crimes are orchestrated by criminals abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities are sometimes forced to wait until suspects travel to places where an arrest can be made more easily. It took federal prosecutors five years to extradite Vladimir Drinkman, a Russian national who was charged with working with Mr. Gonzalez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drinkman was arrested in 2012 while on vacation in Amsterdam, but his extradition was delayed after the Russian government tried to intervene by filing its own extradition request with the Dutch courts. In February, Mr. Drinkman arrived in the United States to stand trial in federal court in Newark after a Dutch judge approved the United States government's extradition request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Russian nationals charged with hacking have avoided trial altogether. Aleksandr Kalinin, a Russian national indicted by federal prosecutors in New York in 2013 in an attack on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> stock market and in other hackings, remains at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of the data breaches may have fallen off the radar, but they aren't off our radar,'' Ms. Caldwell said. ''We have a number of cases where we have indictments under seal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward W. Lowery, the head of the Secret Service's criminal investigations unit, said international cooperation in hacking cases had increased in recent years, particularly in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are still blind spots, said Mr. Lowery, citing ''Eastern European countries, where law enforcement looks the other way.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jenny Wecker, a fledgling Salt Lake City entrepreneur, had a hit on her hands at the end of December: She collected $42,000 in pledges from the crowdfunding site Kickstarter for more than 300 orders of a stylish diaper bag she had designed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project came together in a whirlwind after her husband persuaded her to test a broader market for the bags, which she had been making by hand and marketing on Instagram.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't even think twice about how the taxes would affect us,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with tax preparation time in full swing, thousands of people like Ms. Wecker who ran successful crowdfunding campaigns last year no longer have the luxury of ignoring the tax consequences of their efforts. In the eyes of the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>, they are small-business owners -- and come April 15, the taxman wants his share of their proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo make it fairly easy for creative entrepreneurs to propose new ventures and, if the ideas appeal to a big enough audience, attract capital to finance them. But once the cash changes hands, those who may never have run a business before are thrown straight into the weeds of operating one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax issues can be complex, and as the deadline approaches, terror and confusion reign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People come to me after they get a 1099-K, usually in a panic reaction,'' said Abraham Finberg, a tax accountant in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The form he refers to is the one that tips the I.R.S. off to crowdfunding campaigns. Introduced three years ago, the document is intended to help tax authorities track the kind of online sales that small businesses often do not report. Companies like Amazon, <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and Stripe that process payments for crowdfunding sites are required to send the form to any customer for whom they register 200 annual transactions totaling at least $20,000. (Only 15 percent of the 22,252 projects financed on Kickstarter last year passed that threshold. Smaller projects are still taxable, but they create less of a paper trail for tax authorities to follow.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wecker's tax liability was complicated by a timing issue that ensnares many novices: She ran her campaign in December but was not able to place her overseas production order for the bags until January, which left her with a big chunk of business income in one year and the major expenses to offset it in the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That common crowdfunding pitfall can leave entrepreneurs struggling to pay a larger-than-expected tax bill. Accountants say there are a few ways to handle it, but each involves nuances that are best sorted through with professional help. Businesses with certain corporate structures may be able to adopt a fiscal year that aligns their income and expenses. Others might opt to use an accounting method known as ''accrual,'' which can let those who presell items delay recognizing the income until customers receive the goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most overlooked complications is sales tax. The rules governing it vary by location, and trying to comply with them can be a brain-bending exercise in untangling financial minutiae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many states, merchants have to remit the tax on anything they sell to an in-state buyer. Do digital goods like e-books count? In most states yes, but a few, like North Dakota, specifically exempt them. What about intangibles, like the Skype chats artists sometimes offer their backers? Some states tax them just like retail goods; some exclude them. In others, the rules are still being written.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Amster-Burton, a Seattle author who raised $8,000 on Kickstarter for his culinary travel memoir ''Pretty Good Number One,'' offered a book club chat as a reward for those who pledged $125. He asked Washington State's revenue department for a ruling on whether he could classify some of that money as sales of a service, not a retail good, which would have reduced his tax burden. Its verdict: No. He owed sales tax on everything he collected from in-state buyers, and to calculate it, he had to ask all of his project's backers for their ZIP codes -- information Kickstarter does not provide -- and figure out the correct rate for each Washington resident's city or county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm really annoyed at how difficult Kickstarter and my state make it to do the right thing,'' he said. ''I think I ended up owing less than $100 in tax on my campaign, but it took at least a full week of work to figure it all out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kickstarter spokesman, Justin Kazmark, said the site was trying to improve its tools for helping creators calculate the costs of fulfilling their projects, including expenses like shipping and taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have some very basic educational materials at the moment,'' he said. ''We're ramping that up significantly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because project creators have no way to know in advance how many of their backers will be local, even those who plan for sales tax are stuck trying to guesstimate how they should price it into their rewards. Most do not even try.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we have local backers, we just have to take the hit. You play the odds there,'' said Jarom Olson, the supply-chain manager for Sewell Development Corporation, a company in Orem, Utah, that has run several Kickstarter campaigns for new products in its MOS line of gadget accessories. ''It's a pretty small percentage for us, but it can be painful if you didn't account for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where things get really swampy are the areas that even tax experts disagree about how to handle. The big one is whether, in some circumstances, certain crowdfunding pledges can be treated as gifts, not sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its website, the I.R.S. defines a gift as money a donor gives ''without expecting to receive something of at least equal value in return.'' Most of the rewards crowdfunders offer their backers do not pass that test. For a $115 contribution to Ms. Wecker's Kickstarter, for example, backers will receive a bag that she plans to price at $130 on her website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many crowdfunding campaigns incorporate a handful of higher-priced rewards, aimed at fans with deep pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you pledge $250 in return for having your name painted on a food truck, could part of your pledge be considered a donation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S., which has not issued guidance on the subject, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For tax pros, most people seem to be settling in the camp of 'better safe than sorry,''' said Kelly Phillips Erb, a Pennsylvania lawyer who focuses on tax law. But she said she thinks there's wiggle room. ''This is like the next Bitcoin. At some point, the I.R.S. will have to weigh in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wecker, who usually does her own taxes with TurboTax, hired an accountant this year. She and her husband both have full-time jobs outside her new design business and were initially expecting a sizable refund. Instead, they came out about even -- which she counts as a relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since her Kickstarter campaign ended, she has received a steady stream of inquiries about her bags, and has several potential retail and wholesale clients lined up. The small bit of money she lost on the crowdfunding project was worth it to get the business off the ground, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is part of being a beginner,'' she said. ''You make some mistakes, and try not to make them twice.''</p>

Yelp said the claims in the film, ''Billion Dollar Bully,'' had no merit and that the film's director, Kaylie Milliken, had a history of trying to mislead consumers about Yelp. The claims ''have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the F.T.C., and disproven by academic study,'' Yelp said by email. Analysts at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> and Cowen said Yelp had successfully defended itself against similar accusations. Its shares came off lows to close down 3.5 percent.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Like many tech entrepreneurs, Joshua Reeves says he thinks his company can change the world. It may do it, too -- with the way it was financed, as much as by the product itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reeves's company, ZenPayroll, has raised several million dollars through a network of technology executives.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His cadre numbers 56 such ''angel'' investors, almost all of whom are busy running their own companies. That is more than half the number of employees at ZenPayroll, which has 95 workers and opened for business in late 2012. Among ZenPayroll's investors are people who helped found and run companies like <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span>, <span class="companylink">Evernote</span>, Instagram, Yelp, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. Many are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even a billion dollars, either on paper or actually, depending on whether their companies have entered the public market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reeves, who sought $25,000 to $200,000 from each angel investor, is after more than their money. Each month, he sends investors requests for things he wants them to work on for him and his company, which offers online software that takes care of payroll for midsize and small businesses. It might be sales contacts, or information about how to create a corporate culture, or thoughts on new types of software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They pay us, and they work for us,'' said Mr. Reeves, 30, who has grouped his angels into skill areas, like marketing or technology. ''They are working entrepreneurs who like to think of themselves as company-builders, and attack problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, angel investors were just those early people who believed in someone's dream. Sometimes they were mentors, relatives or friends of friends who would descend with money and walk away, expecting only periodic contacts or updates. But now, Mr. Reeves sees a way to exploit his angels' innate talents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeremy Stoppelman, the co-founder of Yelp, says Mr. Reeves talks to him mostly about building a strong company culture. He was introduced to the company through Aaron Levie, the co-founder of Box, whom Mr. Reeves has used for other introductions. Elad Gil, who sold one company, Mixer Labs, to <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and is now working on a biotech start-up, says he gets questions about issues like mobile application technology and business operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're operator angels, giving firsthand experience,'' Mr. Gil said. ''We give advice and learn things that will go stale very quickly, on things like acquiring users or using mobile. Money managers can't do that for a company; their services are more generic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, ZenPayroll ''is working on a real problem I had in my first start-up,'' he said. ''I wish it had been around then.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evoking passion for solving corporate payroll issues seems unlikely, but these are unlikely times in financing technology start-ups. Just as Tom Sawyer got other boys to whitewash a fence for him, people like Mr. Reeves may be onto a way to create an entire company: Draw on the industry's experience, evoke previous entrepreneurs' interests and continually expand a network of like-minded investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That he can get these human resources says much about the state of values in technology, where money is cheap, compared with time and experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angel investors have been an increasingly important part of how Silicon Valley works for several years, as people have become wealthy earlier in life, and corporate tools like free open-source software and cheap cloud computing resources have lowered the cost of a start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AngelList, which offers to match start-ups with early-stage investors, says it has raised $104 million from 2,673 investors to help finance 243 start-ups. Investors on AngelList are expected to certify that they have more than $200,000 in income for each of the last two years, or over $1 million in net worth over and above the value of their homes. In some cases, AngelList may require proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People can invest by themselves, or follow the investments of various tech executives who participate. Mr. Reeves is one of the featured investors on AngelList, and he has given money (and, he says, time) to start-ups like Clever, which makes online software for education, and Patreon, a service like Kickstarter to support artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reeves is giving the companies he finances the same operator angel treatment he gets from his angels. ''Fund-raising should be like hiring,'' he said. ''Either way, you are putting people in your company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to two long tech booms in just two decades, there are lots of relatively young executives with lots of money. Many invest close to what they know, throwing millions at familiar human and technology networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some older investors see helping people like Mr. Reeves as a way to follow what is happening today, and give back in hard-won experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm 37. I'm the old guy in the room,'' said Mr. Stoppelman, the co-founder of Yelp. ''It's kind of fun to leverage your knowledge, build someone else's success, and see your suggestions put to use. Most start-ups underutilize the people they bring on board.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the ZenPayroll angels, who have built businesses using the same technologies of cloud computing, mobility and open-source software, see themselves as part of a movement. This technology is changing society, they argue, and they like being part of as much of that as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a transcendent moment,'' said Tien Tzuo, the chief executive and co-founder of Zuora, which makes software for companies to run online subscription businesses. ''Fifteen or 20 years ago it was about the money, or for geek status. There's now a visceral feeling that we're changing the world together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this early-stage money can create a level of implied valuation that may be contributing to what many now say is the overvaluation of technology companies. When, after the early investing rounds, start-up companies need the larger sums and corporate connections available through venture capital, they already have a valuation well above what was typical before angel investing became common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the venture round, it has become common for some institutional investors, including private equity funds and even mutual funds, to come in before the company goes public, creating an even higher valuation. The institutional investors are betting that the initial public offering will eventually surpass even that valuation. Thus the angel investors, some argue, are making for a disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot of capital in this market with no tech funding market experience -- angels at the bottom, private equity on top,'' said Dave McClure, whose 500 Startups has financed many early-stage companies. ''Josh deserves a lot of credit, managing an investor group of that size and pushing the investing rounds up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reeves said he was not concerned about a market collapse changing his methods. ''This is entrepreneurs helping other entrepreneurs, and that has always been part of the secret sauce of the valley,'' he said. ''I am looking for mission-driven entrepreneurs. They derive joy from hearing about problems.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Step into the offices on Sand Hill Road, the heart of Silicon Valley venture capital, and one thing is immediately striking -- the almost all-male cast of leading characters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is another corner of the venture capital industry that looks quite different. There, women run firms, and all-female networks of angel investors share deal opportunities and advise one another on investments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This new group of firms and angel networks -- including Cowboy Ventures, Aspect Ventures, Broadway Angels, <span class="companylink">Illuminate Ventures</span>, <span class="companylink">Forerunner Ventures</span> and Aligned Partners -- stands in stark contrast to the rest of the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, these new female-dominated firms and investment networks are a sign of success. There are now enough experienced, financially successful women to start their own firms, the way men with last names like Kleiner and Draper did in the past. In March, six women who are current or former <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> executives announced #Angels, a new angel investing network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to having significant investing or operations experience, the women offer a broader and more diverse network for recruiting and finding new start-ups and an understanding of female consumers, who are often the dominant users of new products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in the middle of a shifting trend where there are newly wealthy women putting their money to work, and similarly we're starting to have a larger number of experienced investors,'' said Jennifer Fonstad, a founder of Aspect Ventures and Broadway Angels, who was formerly a partner at <span class="companylink">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</span>. ''Venture women are going out and doing what we saw a lot of the guys do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is also a sign of the deep-seated problems in the venture capital industry. A recent gender-discrimination trial -- in which Ellen Pao, a former junior partner at <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>, sued the firm -- exposed elements of a male-dominated culture in which women are sorely underrepresented. Over all, just 6 percent of partners at venture capital firms are women, according to the Diana Project at <span class="companylink">Babson College</span>. That is even lower than in 1999, when 10 percent were female. And, according to another study of gender and venture capital, 77 percent of the firms have never had a female investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That study, by Paul A. Gompers, a professor of business administration at <span class="companylink">Harvard Business School</span>, found that a lack of inclusion and mentorship by male partners hurts female partners in a material way, by driving down their overall returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's clear from these results is that investment returns are not only related to your own track record, but to having good colleagues around you,'' said Professor Gompers, who was a paid witness for the defense in the discrimination trial, which Ms. Pao lost. ''And the surprising thing is, on average, women aren't benefiting from their male colleagues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists are, in a way, the gatekeepers to Silicon Valley, and if they are a group of white men who studied at places like Stanford, it is no wonder that most of the entrepreneurs fit the same mold. Venture firms with women as partners are three times as likely to invest in a company with a female chief executive and twice as likely to invest in one with women on the management team, according to the <span class="companylink">Babson College</span> report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of female investors has cascading effects. Start-ups' boards are composed mostly of venture capitalists, so they are often all men. A recent Fortune analysis found that of the 81 start-ups worth more than $1 billion, 5 percent had a female chief executive and 6 percent had a woman on the board. Other studies have found that male founders and directors are less likely to hire women as executives and engineers, or pay men and women equally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Honestly, there will be more female entrepreneurs if there are more female venture capitalists,'' said Brit Morin, founder and chief executive of an e-commerce and crafts site called Brit &amp; Co, whose investors include Cowboy Ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Female investors said they did not specifically seek to invest in companies founded by women, but that because of their networks, they received more pitches from female entrepreneurs. Forty percent of the angel investments made by Sonja Hoel Perkins, a founder of Broadway Angels (not related to Tom Perkins, the co-founder of Kleiner Perkins), have been in companies started by women, a far greater proportion than are made by typical venture funds. That is also the case with a third of Cowboy Ventures' 30 investments, and more than 40 percent of Aspect Ventures' 13 investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are getting a first look at an unfair share of these amazing, oftentimes repeat entrepreneurs, who happen to be female,'' said Theresia Gouw, a founder of Aspect and a former partner at <span class="companylink">Accel</span>. Since more than half of the users of many mobile and social services are women, she added, companies can benefit from having female investors evaluate their products and serve on their boards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been true for Mariam Naficy, the founder and chief executive of Minted, a crowdsourced marketplace for stationery and art that has raised $89 million. Early in her company's life, before there was data to prove that her idea was a good one, female investors were much more likely than men to understand it, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without being able to see quantitative evidence of better design, most male investors couldn't allow themselves to make the leap,'' Ms. Naficy said. ''To virtually every female investor I met with, it was clear Minted's community was producing far fresher and more unique design than our competitors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems to be paying off for Ms. Perkins, who was an early investor in Minted and said it is on track to being worth $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that female venture capitalists invest only in companies with predominantly female customers. ''There's a myth out there that women only know how to invest in women's products,'' said Cindy Padnos, founder of <span class="companylink">Illuminate Ventures</span>. She invests in cloud and mobile services for businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Women say, 'If there were more women founders, I would invest in more of them,' '' she said. ''That's too easy an excuse. You have to go out of your way to identify them and be receptive and show them this is a place where women and men succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the women who have started the new firms said they did it because after spending so much time with entrepreneurs, they wanted to create their own start-ups. Because many traditional venture funds have ballooned and expanded to late-stage and international companies, there was a need for new, smaller investors who were focused on financing early-stage companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in a valley of people who challenge the status quo, so it sort of seems natural that we have venture investors who are thinking about how to do things differently,'' said Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures and a former partner at <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of all, Ms. Perkins said, working with women seemed fun. ''All of us thought it would be great to be only women because all of us had worked with only men our whole lives,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I also thought it would be inspiring for women and girls to get into venture capital and technology,'' she added, ''because I think a lot of women think, 'Why be in venture capital if you perceive the industry as not being friendly toward you?' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yaniv Liron has pulled cash and credit from every available source to keep his 11-year-old web design and development business, Lumina, running smoothly -- a situation familiar to many small-business owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though his company, in New York City, is established and profitable, obtaining a bank loan or credit line has always been painful. The paperwork takes days to prepare, approval decisions can drag on for weeks or months and the process, he said, ''involves selling your soul and begging on your knees.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four months ago, he found a simpler source of working capital: Fundbox, a company that gives business owners cash advances against their outstanding invoices. Within an hour of signing up on Fundbox's website and allowing access to his company's bank account and accounting software, QuickBooks Online, Mr. Liron had a $2,500 credit line. It takes just a few mouse clicks for Mr. Liron to select an unpaid invoice in QuickBooks and have Fundbox rapidly deposit the cash into his bank account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a handy tool,'' he said. ''I can't go to my employees and say, 'A client isn't paying me, so I can't pay you.' This helps even things out. I've tried all kinds of different methods of financing, and this was definitely the easiest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in Silicon Valley are also excited about Fundbox, which closed a $40 million funding round last month. The company specializes in loans too tiny for most banks to bother with, offering credit lines of $1,000 to $25,000 to clients that range from sole practitioners like freelance programmers and designers to companies with dozens of employees, like small manufacturing firms. Customers can borrow in increments of as little as $100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fundbox's ambitions are much larger than its loans. ''We believe we can create the next <span class="companylink">Visa</span>,'' said Eyal Shinar, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company, which is based in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To win new customers, Fundbox is competing with an expanding crop of online lending rivals. The field includes BlueVine, another firm that advances funds against invoices; small-term lenders like Kabbage and <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span>; peer-to-peer lenders like Funding Circle, <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and Prosper; and payment processors like <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and Square, which offer loans to some of their merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each has a different business model, but they're all eyeing a similar market: loans of four to six figures to companies too new or too risky to interest banks and traditional lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That market has been badly underserved, according to Karen G. Mills, a senior fellow at <span class="companylink">Harvard Business School</span> and former administrator of the United States Small Business Administration. Because the underwriting costs for banks to scrutinize a potential borrower's financial records and business plan are about the same for a $2 million loan or a $20,000 one, it's often not worth the banks' time to bother with the smaller sums. Credit cards are an option, but business cards can be hard to qualify for, and the cost of cash advances from them can be dauntingly high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The online lenders have two advantages over banks: internally developed algorithms and lending models that they say allow them to operate profitably in a market traditionally viewed as fairly risky, and fewer regulatory constraints. Because these firms largely work outside the banking system, the new online marketplace currently ''falls between the cracks'' for federal regulators, Ms. Mills said. (She says that may eventually change if the market grows big enough to attract closer attention from lawmakers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the companies can get away with sometimes charging rates far steeper than those of traditional lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fundbox, for example, advances cash for 12 weeks, and collects its repayment in weekly installments automatically debited from the borrower's bank account. Its fees vary based on the riskiness of the loan, but the typical fee for an advance on a $5,000 invoice would be in the $243 to $343 range, broken up over the life of the loan. (If a loan is paid back early, before the 12 weeks are up, the remaining fees are waived.) That translates to an A.P.R. of 38 to 54 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shinar, Fundbox's founder, thinks metrics like annual rates are the wrong way to look at his company's service. ''We don't want to be a loan,'' he said. ''That's not the right financial discipline for business owners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He views Fundbox's advances as a short-term way to smooth out the often lumpy cash flows of small companies, which sometimes need capital right away for projects they will be paid for later. Because the cost of the advance is clearly displayed at the outset -- click on an invoice you're considering borrowing against, and a pop-up window displays the exact amount of Fundbox's fee and each weekly repayment installment -- he considers the company's pricing more transparent than that of other lending options, like credit cards, that may offer lower rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some customers also see it that way. ''I'm not too concerned about the rates,'' said Ross R. Mason, the founder of <span class="companylink">Motion Media Solutions</span>, a video production company in Addison, Tex. ''The costs are very clear, and the cash flow is perfect. I can't imagine how it could be done better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For him, the biggest advantage of Fundbox is its direct integration with his online QuickBooks account. ''Everything is automatic and immediate, so we don't have to spend time on extra entries and accounting,'' he said. ''We know the money is coming in soon from our clients, so we're not going to get overextended, and we pay attention to the balances every week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even tiny loans can make a significant difference for some entrepreneurs. Moira Richardson began selling paintings, crafts and art supplies on <span class="companylink">Etsy</span> in 2007 and turned her online shops into her full-time job two years ago. Soon after, she applied online for a Kabbage account. Although the amount of personal information the application required -- including access to her bank account and the <span class="companylink">eBay</span> account she sometimes sells through -- gave her pause, she decided to ''take the plunge'' and try it, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within minutes, she had access to a $700 credit line. Her first loan from it let her buy inventory for her supplies shop. She has used the Kabbage line nine times since then, usually paying the loans off early to save on fees and factoring her borrowing costs into the product prices she sets in her store. Most recently, she used a loan to stock up on several newly released printing plate sizes from Gelli Arts -- items she knew would be in heavy demand by her customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I ordered a few cases right away, and then Gelli Arts quickly sold out of the first batch,'' said Ms. Richardson, who lives in Mount Pleasant, Pa. ''The loan gave me a chance to have the hot inventory in my shop before anybody else did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new lenders still represent a sliver of the overall market for business credit, but they are growing fast. Fundbox expects its loan volume to be at least $200 million this year, and Kabbage says it is now funding $3 million a day in loans, up from under $1 million a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mills thinks those numbers will keep snowballing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These new entrants have done a couple of really innovative things that bankers haven't done,'' especially around customer service, loan approval speed and fee transparency, she said. ''In many ways, I'm delighted with how this has developed. Entrepreneurs are the market, and they're also the ones solving the problem. They're seeing the gap and stepping in.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- President Obama and the Republicans in Congress clashed over taxes and wealth on Thursday, a day after many Americans sent checks to the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>, as the House voted to repeal the federal tax levied on multimillion-dollar estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republican leaders hailed the vote as a victory for farmers and small-business owners who may otherwise be forced to sell assets after the death of a spouse or a parent to pay taxes on property that has already been taxed. The White House called it a giveaway to a few thousand of the nation's wealthiest families and said it would raise federal deficits.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote was the first in a decade to eliminate what Republicans call the death tax, and it stands little chance of making it out of the Senate, much less past the president's veto pen. But each side saw an opportunity to portray the other as out of touch on an issue that resonates beyond the few who would directly benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Family farmers, ranchers and small-business owners work tirelessly to create jobs in our communities, put food on our tables and, God willing, have something to pass on to their children and grandchildren,'' the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement. ''Taking away that opportunity with a massive death tax bill is simply wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a column in <span class="companylink">USA Today</span>, Representatives Kevin Brady of Texas and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, both Republicans, cited estimates that repealing the tax would create 139,000 jobs. ''The 'death tax' is an immoral tax and an attack on the American dream,'' they wrote, adding, ''Why is America punishing success?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that repealing the estate tax would cost the Treasury $14.6 billion in the 2016 fiscal year and $269 billion over 10 years. Mr. Boehner said that ''is nothing more than a drop in the bucket to the federal government.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Republicans were applying a double standard since they usually demand that Mr. Obama offset any tax cuts he proposes, while theirs would simply add to the deficit. ''Some might even call it hypocritical,'' he said, ''but it certainly is in my mind at least ironic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats, including the president and his aides, said Republicans were catering to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else. Earlier this week, Mr. Obama contrasted Republican priorities with his own plan to reduce taxes for low- and middle-income families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very vivid illustration of the different values and priorities between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to tax policy,'' Mr. Earnest said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal tax currently applies to estates worth more than $5.43 million for an individual or $10.86 million for a couple. Assets above those levels are taxed at rates up to 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to government estimates, 5,400 estates would be affected this year, accounting for 0.2 percent of the deaths anticipated in the United States. During a visit to Charlotte on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said a repeal would benefit just 120 households in North Carolina. By contrast, he said, his tax plans would help 44 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vote in the House was 240 to 179, largely along party lines.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, for the third time since 2012, the <span class="companylink">Export-Import Bank of the United States</span>, an export credit agency that backs loans to foreign entities that help cement deals with American exporters -- and thus helps create American jobs -- must be reauthorized by Congress. Otherwise it will go out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of its existence, the Ex-Im Bank wasn't even remotely controversial; it would be routinely reauthorized for four to seven years at a time. Its underwriting was -- and remains -- impeccable, with a default rate of under 2 percent. With dozens of other countries using their own export credit agencies to help homegrown companies land deals, the Ex-Im Bank was viewed as an important equalizer for American companies, especially small businesses, which often can't find funding when they want to sell their goods in foreign markets.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last few years, prodded in part by <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span>, which objects to the lending assistance the Ex-Im Bank gives to foreign purchasers of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> aircraft, Tea Party Republicans have agitated to shut it down. In doing so, they have turned the fight over the Ex-Im Bank into an ideological litmus test. The bank's dealings with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, they claim, are an example of ''crony capitalism.'' The bank is in the business of picking ''winners and losers,'' something the government shouldn't be doing, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets in the way of truly free markets. The last time the Ex-Im Bank was up for reauthorization, in September, Republicans grudgingly agreed to a short-term extension. Now its opponents are moving in for the kill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the charge are the conservative think tanks, like <span class="companylink">the Heritage Foundation</span> and <span class="companylink">Americans for Prosperity</span>, which just the other day sponsored a conference call with Senator -- and presidential candidate -- Marco Rubio, who described the agency's work as ''corporate welfare.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, however, one conservative think tank that has refused to join the crowd: the five-year-old American Action Forum, or A.A.F., co-founded and led by the economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Since last May, it has issued a series of reports making the case that the country is better off with the Ex-Im Bank than without it. Given the way apostasy is treated among conservative ideologues, this struck me as courageous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turns out, Holtz-Eakin doesn't view the American Action Forum's stance as especially courageous. ''I am a conservative,'' he stressed -- and most of the policy positions his think tank takes, on issues like tax policy and regulation, are unambiguously conservative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But,'' he added, ''I think too many conservative arguments are made on the basis of ideology and faith. We are dedicated to the numbers at A.A.F. We can't just assert that markets work; we have to show it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, his think tank supports the Ex-Im Bank because that's where the numbers -- and the facts -- led it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holtz-Eakin, 57, has held a number of important policy jobs in government. He was part of the Council of Economic Advisers under both Presidents Bush, the second time as its lead economist. He was an adviser to Senator John McCain during his presidential race. And between 2003 and 2005, he was the director of the Congressional Budget Office, which places a high premium on just-the-facts-ma'am numbers and research. ''It is really important to have that kind of information in any sort of policy debate,'' Holtz-Eakin told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus it is that Holtz-Eakin believes that immigration reform should reward skills and let in more immigrants. ''The data shows that immigration offers great opportunity as an economic policy,'' he said. As a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, he refused to sign on to the right wing's pet theory that the entire crisis could be blamed on <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. ''I have no love of Fannie and Freddie,'' he said. ''But they weren't the sole cause of the crisis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Ex-Im Bank, Holtz-Eakin decided to get his think tank involved last year, as the agency became a hot-button issue among conservatives. He directed a young research associate, Andy Winkler, to do a series of deep dives into the Ex-Im Bank; that research led the American Action Forum to support its continued existence. ''It would be a negative if we got rid of it,'' Holtz-Eakin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent piece of research by Winkler showed that, far from being in the back pocket of big companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, the Ex-Im Bank made loans that were an accurate reflection of American trade itself. Big companies make up a small percentage of the corporations that export goods, but they account for a high volume of the dollars involved. The vast majority of exporters are small businesses, though their aggregate dollar volume is much smaller. The Ex-Im Bank's loan portfolio is in about the same ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winkler, who is 24, came to the American Action Forum straight out of college. What have you learned from working with Holtz-Eakin? I asked him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The numbers come first,'' he replied.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the increasingly unpopular practice of civil forfeiture, law enforcement agents can seize property suspected of having ties to crime, even if no charges are filed -- and then begin forfeiture proceedings, in which the burden of proof is on the owner. Often the cost of fighting such a seizure is greater than the value of the assets seized, and law enforcement agencies get to keep forfeiture proceeds. Such a windfall, critics say, creates perverse incentives, and the lack of due process runs counter to the central tenets of the American justice system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLellan's money was seized under a subset of civil forfeiture law that governs cash deposits under $10,000, the threshold at which a bank is required to report the transaction to the government. But limiting deposits to less than $10,000 to evade the reporting requirement, known as structuring, is illegal in its own right. Structuring seizures have ballooned in recent years as law enforcement task forces comb through hundreds of thousands of bank reports, often using warrants based on nothing more than a pattern of deposits. The I.R.S. alone made 639 structuring seizures in 2012, up from 114 in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seizure dragnet has ensnared small business owners who operate with cash and may have legitimate reasons to keep their deposits low, or do not know that doing so could get them into trouble. In Michigan, for example, the owners of a drugstore had an insurance policy that only covered the loss of $10,000 or less in cash. In the case of Carole Hinders, whose modest Mexican restaurant in Iowa specialized in Insane Tacos, she was following advice dispensed by her mother decades before: that smaller deposits meant less paperwork for the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After these cases and others received public scrutiny, the I.R.S. announced last October that it would no longer pursue structuring cases unless the money was tied to some other illegal activity. The Justice Department followed suit in March. But neither change in policy was retroactive, and the United States attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina has continued to pursue the forfeiture of Mr. McLellan's money, though no crime has been charged. The Justice Department declined to comment on an open case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like I was just slapped in the face with something. I didn't know what was going on,'' said Mr. McLellan, 50, who has a 10th-grade education and has built a small gas station into a convenience store and restaurant. ''You work for something for 13, 14 years, and they take it in 13, 14 minutes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a congressional hearing in February, Representative George Holding, a Republican from North Carolina, referred to Mr. McLellan's case, saying no crime other than structuring had been alleged. ''If that case exists, then it's not following the policy,'' John Koskinen, the commissioner of the I.R.S., said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the prosecutor on the case, Steve West, was unmoved. Notified of the hearing by Mr. McLellan's lawyer at the time, he responded with concern that the seizure warrant in the case, filed under seal but later given to Mr. McLellan, had been handed over to a congressional committee, according to an email exchange provided to The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> by the <span class="companylink">Institute for Justice</span>, a libertarian public interest law firm that has taken over the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your client needs to resolve this or litigate it,'' Mr. West wrote. ''But publicity about it doesn't help. It just ratchets up feelings in the agency.'' He concluded with a settlement offer in which the government would keep half the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLellan's new lawyer, Robert Everett Johnson, said the fact that prosecutors refuse to drop the case shows that self-restraint by federal agencies is not enough and that Congress needs to rein in civil forfeiture. Republicans, led by Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, have filed a bill in the House and Senate to change the practice, and the Judiciary Committees of both houses are working on a proposal.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit their country over the weekend, many Nepalis at home and abroad have found a new way to help -- as digital volunteers, spending hours hunched over their laptops, using crowdsourcing technologies and social platforms to participate in the relief effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are three examples of initiatives led by Nepalis to assist their countrymen as they try to rebuild, using open-source mapping, crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, and how experts see the effort.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Open Mapping: Kathmandu Living Labs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nepali-based nonprofit technology company focused on open-source mapping was created by Nama Raj Budhathoki, 45, who received a Ph.D. in crowdsourcing, open data and social and mobile media at the <span class="companylink">University of Illinois</span>, Urbana-Champaign. Born in Dhading, he currently lives in Kathmandu and serves on the board of directors of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, which focues on open-mapping in the context of humanitarian work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has the earthquake affected your friends and family?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, there were no deaths in my immediate family, but I've been sleeping in a tent with my family of five because we are too scared to go back into our home. I haven't been able to get in touch with many of my friends, and since my work began, I've had no time to check in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How are you using technology to help in relief efforts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd say we have mapped about 70-80 percent of the earthquake-hit zones. Before the earthquake, I had 7 to 100 volunteers a day. Now I'm coordinating about 2,400 mappers, a majority of them international, from a situation room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started Kathmandu Living Labs, a Nepali-based nonprofit technology company in 2013 because I knew an earthquake would hit Nepal. Every data is open source and we don't sell data. We have been mapping the country using OpenStreetMap, the Wikipedia of mapping where people can view, contribute and edit. For example, we use satellite imaging from companies like <span class="companylink">DigitalGlobe</span> to identify displaced people. We also deployed a mobile app so people can report observations, which are plotted on a map. We also try to verify these accounts on the ground and through social media like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, though it is obviously hard to go on the ground to check each incident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I studied the use of open mapping for my Ph.D. and saw how it was heavily used during the earthquake in Haiti. I came back to Nepal after finishing my studies in 2011, and started mobilizing an OpenStreetMap community of volunteers to map major points of interests like roads, buildings, schools and hospitals. Before the earthquake, we had the most detailed map of Kathmandu Valley in the country. After the earthquake, we expanded beyond Kathmandu and teamed up with Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, a group of open mappers focused on humanitarian relief mainly from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you measure your impact?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a bit too early to say since we went live on Monday, but we are working with several humanitarian groups on a daily basis, including the Red Cross and the Nepali Army, to provide maps of road blocks and displaced people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What challenges are you facing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to track satellite images outside of Kathmandu especially because of rain. It's also hard to effectively mobilize so many volunteers across different time zones. We're a small nonprofit, and we weren't prepared for the scale of this disaster. The building we are working in is not very safe and we need more computers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Expert's Take:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dale Kunce, a senior engineer at <span class="companylink">American Red Cross International</span> Services, said Mr. Budhathoki's project was providing data that the Red Cross gives to its relief staff on the ground. ''We have a longstanding relationship with the team and we've been using them as a sounding board,'' he said. The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> also used the Living Labs maps as a source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adele Waugaman, a former fellow at the <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> Humanitarian Initiative, said, ''The open mapping community is a really wonderful resource. Kathmandu Living Labs was able to map all the health facilities in Kathmandu Valley before the earthquake, which will undoubtedly help the relief workers' ability to deliver supplies and help save lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Success is being able to mount an effective response in coordination with a local community,'' she said, ''and I think the mapping work they are doing is a demonstration of how that can be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding: Indiegogo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lokesh Todi, 28, has raised over $100,000 in six days using the crowdfunding platform, Indiegogo. He returned to Kathmandu nine months ago after completing his M.B.A. from <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> with a course on managing global catastrophes. He currently works in his family cement business, Reliance Group Nepal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How has the earthquake affected your friends and family?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily for me and my immediate family and friends, nothing traumatic happened. We are lucky we are from good backgrounds in safe homes with access to food and drinking water. There's guilt associated with that; it plays on your mind. People are mentally scarred. My 9-year-old nephew is still afraid to climb the stairs past the first floor in case something happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How are you using technology to help in relief efforts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiegogo is a site much like Kickstarter, but people use it for fund-raising. The whole idea was to use me and my cousin Aditya's network of friends in the United States to raise money. We raised $20,000 within the first 12 hours. Overnight, after I took photos of the destruction and shared them on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, it shot up to $40,000. People are engaging with us because I'm posting video updates, responding to the press and connecting with individuals. (According to the site, in six days, 1,445 people have raised more than $116,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm also working with Global Shapers, a network of young leaders, in partnership with Childreach, an NGO working in the Sindhupalchowk district. I'm posting on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> what they need and handling the logistics of getting the aid to them. I'm also working with Uber to pick up donations from people's homes in India. A friend at an Indian airline was able to help me figure out how to get the aid here. I've had to tell people only to collect things I'm asking for on behalf of the NGO; we'd rather get cash than donations for things we don't need. That's the message the government should be telling people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nepal, we don't have a good, structured, central way of handling disasters, so we depend heavily on international aid and NGOs. The country needs to be thankful for them, but after they leave, the burden shifts to local NGOs who don't have international connections to raise money. My aim is to get money for local NGOs to do relief work for the foreseeable future, one or two years. One hundred rupees, or one dollar, goes a long way in a small village in Nepal. That's two or three big meals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you ensure that your efforts make an impact on the ground?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've identified three areas for the money to go: child care, women's issues and sanitation. We have another 20 days or so before the funds are released from Indiegogo, but in the meantime we are vetting local NGOs: What is their history and do they have experience with the community and terrain?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Expert's Take:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this is a wonderful model,'' said Ms. Waugaman. ''These crowdfunding models take off when you have a relationship with someone in the affected area, who you trust and is endorsing a particular organization, especially a small one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volunteer Coordination: <span class="companylink">Google</span> Docs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ravi Kumar, who also goes by the name Ravi Nepal, 27, is the co-founder of Code for Nepal which aims to increase digital literacy and use of open data. From Janakpur, living in Washington, he is crowdsourcing on social media to help disseminate information about relief aid for victims of the earthquake. He received an M.S. in digital media from <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How has the earthquake affected your friends and family?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My parents had been sleeping outside their house in a nearby open space. They recently moved back inside. My uncle and aunt live with their two children in Kathmandu. They have minor injuries. They lived in a shared tent with neighbors for two days. Due to rain, I was told their son got sick. Our house has some cracks. Nothing life-threatening though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How are you using technology to help in relief efforts?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm using technology to do three things:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Create low-tech solutions to connect volunteers and people affected, and vice versa. Our #Nepalquake resource doc, which disseminates information about food, shelter, clean water and medicine for victims of the earthquake, has been shared more than 7,000 times on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and more than 50 volunteers actively curate, verify and connect people using that document. Because many Nepalis are on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and it's easy to use it even with slow Internet in Nepal, we have been using <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ads to inform people. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is kind of like radio for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. We are using Viber to get latest status updates on volunteers, or at times to help with urgent needs, blast those needs via <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> and/or <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and do our best to find volunteers who can help people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interactive map to help #NepalRelief deliver aid in all affected areas: http://t.co/QtfSL52mT8[http://t.co/QtfSL52mT8] #NepalQuake #dataviz pic.twitter.com/vNCGJXuDQM -- Ravi Nepal (@RaviNepal) April 29, 2015</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. We are using social media and data to dispel rumors. A map we published this week is a good example that shows most of the country, in fact, is intact and with everyone's help, we will recover, rise, and rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you measure success?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to say exactly how many people are benefiting from our initiative. The document has been shared roughly 8,000 times on social media. A local group of volunteers and people in need are using this document to coordinate. A group reached out to me saying they want to use our doc to build an app. Our <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ads have reached at least 70,000 people. I get 4 to 8 calls a day about coordination. From the response, I believe many people are using this document.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do you ensure that your efforts make an impact on the ground?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do our best to follow-up. For example, a young woman based in Virginia called me using Viber about a victim trapped on the outskirts of Kathmandu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she called me, she sounded very worried. I assured her that if she sends me more details, I'll work with contacts and will do our best to help. I sent out information to our contacts, and we were told volunteers were dispatched who were already in the area. After 24 hours, I contacted the woman again and she told me the victim got some help. And also told me that people in nearby area need more help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Update: Some help in Sindhupalchowk. But #NepalRelief not yet in Kavre? Kids at risk. Pls help them. #NepalEarthquake pic.twitter.com/0hCLbzYmLl -- Ravi Nepal (@RaviNepal) April 29, 2015</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our volunteers also call people listed on the document about their latest status and what they need. They then update the document reflecting any changes on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That being said, we don't know if all of the information is accurate, since it's a publicly crowdsourced document. Anyone can comment and few, around 20, super users have full access to edit, and some of us call to verify information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">â–&nbsp; Expert's Take:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Madhur Basnet, who is working in the Gordkha district, said he would have used the work by Code for Nepal and Kathmandu Living Labs if he had Internet connectivity. Instead, when he does have Internet access, he saves screenshots of maps on his cellphone to use offline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Waugaman said, ''This kind of open approach to gathering information and analyzing information can be incredibly valuable in a resource-constrained context where there are not enough responders on the ground, though you need some degree of verification.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often times the problem is not the technology,'' she added, ''but the personal and institutional barriers, including whether the tool is capable of functioning offline in hot zones.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> is a talent agency as much as a tech investor. Marc Andreessen, the web pioneer who was a founder of Netscape and other companies before trying his hand at venture capital, has made this point explicitly. At a private event in 2010, a video of which The Wall Street Journal made public, he interviewed Michael Ovitz, the onetime Hollywood superagent who started <span class="companylink">Creative Artists Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of what we're trying to do at <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> is based directly on Michael's experience building C.A.A.,'' Mr. Andreessen told the Silicon Valley big shots assembled for the occasion. The firm declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarities between the two businesses run deep. It's not just that the <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> partners, including Mr. Andreessen's longtime collaborator, Ben Horowitz, realized that a V.C. firm could be run like a talent agency. It's that the economics of Silicon Valley are uncannily similar to those of Hollywood. And by exploiting that insight, they may have helped inflate a tech bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the attention Mr. Ovitz lavished on his stars -- Creative Artists partners sat on boards of hospitals and private schools so they could help clients win preferential treatment -- by far the most important things he procured for them were money and control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1970s, when Mr. Ovitz founded C.A.A., the breakdown of the traditional studio system had created a world in which stars had potentially enormous if little appreciated leverage. ''For 60 years, the studios really took advantage of the creative talent,'' Mr. Ovitz said in an interview. ''We tried to change the entire curve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The studios still craved stars but no longer had formal sway over them through long-term contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ovitz assembled a murderers' row of clients and used their collective power to win them fantastically lucrative business terms. ''Ovitz said, 'I'm going to straighten out your life,' and he made a deal for me with <span class="companylink">Universal</span>,'' Martin Scorsese said in 1999. ''They built these offices and screening room and helped me with my film foundation.'' The firm also represented Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise and Glenn Close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Andreessen, for his part, exploited a shift in power from venture capitalists to start-up founders in Silicon Valley. In the 1970s, V.C.s fronted entrepreneurs relatively small sums for large equity stakes in their start-ups. By the 2000s, however, new technologies trimmed the cost of getting a company off the ground. ''We estimated that it costs 10 percent what it cost even 10 years ago to start a software company,'' said David Golden of Revolution Ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep-pocketed individual investors known as angels also made it possible for nearly anyone to start a company without a V.C.'s help. By the time an entrepreneur met with one, the business was more likely to be growing exponentially, making the V.C. the supplicant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital used to be about ferreting out the best deals, said Naval Ravikant, a longtime investor who founded the investment syndication site AngelList. Now, he says, ''the question is who gets access.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span>'s pro-talent stance has helped win over founders, but as with Creative Artists the key to its recruiting success has been the allure of highly favorable financial terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way the typical venture capital deal works is that the V.C. will place a ''pre-money'' valuation on the company he or she is hoping to fund, then add an equity stake on top of it. For example, if the V.C. deems the company to be worth $40 million before the investment, and invests $10 million, the V.C. will then own 20 percent of the company, now valued at $50 million. The higher the valuation, the better it is for the entrepreneur, who gives up less equity for a given amount of cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within Silicon Valley, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> is famous for bidding valuations to heights that make rivals uncomfortable. To offset the dilution of ownership that comes from such prices, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> -- which says it manages $4.2 billion in assets -- increases the amount of money it invests. The firm often kicks in more than the entrepreneur asks for, according to rival V.C.s who have been involved in these deals. (Some investors agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity.) ''They want to basically change the table stakes in a poker game,'' said Greg Kidd, an angel investor in several companies Andreessen later funded. ''There are some other folks who can cut checks like that, but there aren't that many.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists who have bid against <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> say the firm often comes in 50 to 100 percent higher than many other bidders, as when it led an ill-advised $40 million investment round in a daily deal site called Fab in 2011, which valued the company at $200 million. (The firm has occasionally passed on big deals, like one with Uber, that it felt were too costly.) These prices are flattering to the entrepreneur, who suddenly runs a company worth twice as much on paper as previously thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is an article of faith in Hollywood that hiring stars significantly increases the chances of scoring a blockbuster. Alas, this is not the case. Studying movies released between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, Arthur S. De Vany, an expert on film economics, found that the participation of only 19 star actors and directors appeared to improve a movie's chances of grossing more than $50 million. And the stars' stunning paydays often leeched away studio profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The forces that govern movies and start-ups are remarkably similar. They both follow what is known as a power-law distribution, meaning that the overwhelming majority of investments lose money, while a small fraction break even or become marginally profitable, and an even smaller fraction become wildly successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Andreessen and his partners seem to believe they're playing a role analogous to that of Mr. Ovitz and his fellow superagents: They do what it takes to lock up talent, which they eventually sell to someone else at a huge markup. This generates profits for themselves and a nice payday for the stars, whether they are Hollywood celebrities or entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if the <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> partners have the analogy wrong? Rather than profiting like Mr. Ovitz and his fellow agents, the venture capitalists may be more like the Hollywood studios -- chronically overpaying for projects whose costs they can rarely recoup. Mr. Andreessen and his partners have invested so much in so many start-ups that it would take a remarkable string of successes to make the approach pay off. For all their skill -- the firm bought into the likes of <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, Instagram and <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> relatively early -- their track record suggests it's unlikely. Already, they've suffered a few impressive flameouts, including Fab, on which they are likely to lose tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when they pick well, they often bid so much for stars that the return is relatively modest. It's easier to triple or quadruple your money when you've invested $10 million in a $100 million company than when you've invested nearly $100 million in a $1 billion company, as they did with the daily deal site <span class="companylink">Zulily</span>. There are only so many companies that are acquired for billions of dollars or reach that kind of price through an initial public offering. Fewer retain such valuations -- <span class="companylink">Zulily</span>'s stock price has fallen sharply since last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than is the case with other firms, the fate of <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> may be closely tied to that of the overall tech market. If prices remain buoyant, the eye-popping valuations of the firm's top-performing companies will keep it profitable and losses will be containable. But if the market turns, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> could have serious trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> isn't just a beneficiary of behavior that's driving up valuations. If a bubble is forming, it is ultimately because too much money is chasing too few companies. But the firm's own aggressive bidding may be partly responsible. ''Because there is competition for deals, when you have actors in the market showing no price discipline, it drives up the cost for everyone,'' said one investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, Mr. Andreessen has argued that the tech market is rational -- that tectonic forces, like the proliferation of smartphones, have fundamentally changed the value of popular software. But even Mr. Andreessen has expressed some concern. Last September, he posted on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>: ''When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on.'' He warned that companies that hadn't conserved their cash would ''vaporize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may have been a plea to entrepreneurs on whom his firm had lavished tens of millions of dollars. Stars have many virtues. But the lesson taught by Hollywood is that they tend to make everyone poorer but themselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capital firms, hedge funds and the likes of business executives such as Rupert Murdoch are all vying for a piece of India's rapidly growing e-commerce market -- particularly companies aimed at the growing number of aspiring middle-class consumers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a radical turnaround from just a few years ago, when fewer smartphones, a smaller number of Internet users, general government inertia and a lack of funding hampered many entrepreneurs and start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of the shift is how quickly the fortunes have turned around for Pranay Chulet, who returned to India in 2008 after consulting stints at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> and Booz Allen Hamilton. When he first set up an online classifieds portal called Quikr, the early years were grueling: Every investor he approached was skeptical about the idea of selling used goods, a social taboo in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took Mr. Chulet three years to get Quikr its first backer. But now <span class="companylink">Tiger Global Management</span>, Warburg Pincus and <span class="companylink">eBay</span> are among its investors. Quikr soared to a $1 billion valuation (vaulting it to the ranks of so-called unicorns) after a funding round in mid-April involving its existing investors as well as Steadview Capital of Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well-known investors like Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba; and Mr. Murdoch, the media tycoon, have all made investments in India's e-commerce companies. They are going head-to-head with other experienced tech investors like Sequoia Capital and <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Son said he would pump $10 billion into India, joking during a visit that he was ''speed dating'' entrepreneurs to gauge their passion. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, posed on a festooned truck holding a $2 billion check to be invested in the company's India unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's market potential is enticing. Only 300 million Indians, or less than 25 percent of the country, are Internet users, and while that is already the second-largest Internet market in the world, after China, five million users are added each month, according to Rajan Anandan, <span class="companylink">Google India</span>'s managing director. The number of Internet users in India is expected to reach 500 million in three years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Half a billion is a huge prize,'' said Ravi Gururaj, who helps technology-backed start-ups in his role as chairman of the product council of India's technology industry trade body, Nasscom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is such interest that has created several technology ''unicorns'' in India -- or privately held start-ups worth $1 billion or more. The value of the online store <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span> -- whose backers include Tiger Global and the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner's firm DST Global -- rose to $11 billion from $3 billion in one year. The valuation of Snapdeal, a leading e-commerce site backed by SoftBank, rose to $2 billion from $350 million in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No major market has multiplied at these rates in the history of this medium,'' said Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As investors rush in, the stampede has brought its own set of challenges. Despite the optimism, none of India's e-commerce players are profitable yet. For now, it is a game of capturing market share, and the expenses are high as rivals try to distinguish themselves in front-page newspaper ads and prime-time TV commercials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the matter of the aggressive valuations that start-up founders are demanding. News reports this year suggested that a deal between Alibaba and Snapdeal fell through because the two could not agree on a valuation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such inflated prices, investors ought to be wary. Any downturn could take with it hundreds of millions of dollars of their money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Follow-on financing offers land even before entrepreneurs have closed the previous round. It is a little chaotic,'' said Shailendra Singh, managing partner at Sequoia Capital in India, which has investments in the cab-summoning app Ola and the restaurant and food platform <span class="companylink">Zomato</span>. Investors get sticker shock as entrepreneurs demand outrageous multiples and stiff premiums. Mr. Singh said some demands were ''uncomfortably high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the investor interest and money are being aggressively put to use by start-ups like <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span>, which has tripled its number of employees in one year, to 33,000 as of March. It says it has averaged eight million shipments a month (compared with three million a year ago). It recently hired two Silicon Valley-based <span class="companylink">Google</span> executives: Punit Soni, as its chief product officer, and Peeyush Ranjan, as its head of engineering. Both will be based in Bangalore, where <span class="companylink">Flipkart</span> has leased 1.5 million square feet for its new campus in an office park backed by the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, the private equity firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the value of goods sold on Snapdeal -- which offers goods as varied as bulletproof cars and luggage made in Mumbai's slums -- exceeds that of India's largest offline retailers, said Mr. Bahl, its co-founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other tech investors have been enticed by the quality of start-ups in India. Pepperfry, a furniture seller, raised financing from <span class="companylink">Bertelsmann</span> and <span class="companylink">Norwest Venture Partners</span>, and its rival Urban Ladder was backed by Steadview Capital Management and <span class="companylink">SAIF Partners</span>. Furlenco, which offers monthly furniture rentals, was started by a former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> executive and received its backing from Lightbox Ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big investors are finding themselves battling rivals. A real estate service, CommonFloor, got capital from Tiger Global to compete against its rivals Housing.com, backed by SoftBank, and PropTiger, backed by Mr. Murdoch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the two or three category leaders has 10 investors in pursuit. ''That is driving up valuations. Everything is getting amplified,'' said Mukul Singhal, a principal at <span class="companylink">SAIF Partners</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts see India's e-commerce market at an inflection point. A recent <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> report titled ''The Next India'' said Indian e-commerce would expand to $100 billion in revenue by 2020, from $2.9 billion in 2013, making it the world's fastest-growing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India's youthful market makes it an e-commerce sweet spot, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of India's largest mobile payments platform, Paytm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only young people facilitate mass adoption of technology. This kind of e-commerce revolution could never happen in Europe with its aged populations,'' said Mr. Sharma, whose firm is backed by <span class="companylink">Ant Financial</span>, an Alibaba affiliate that invested $575 million in January for a 25 percent stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paytm has 20 million active wallet users (compared with 190 million for <span class="companylink">Ant Financial</span>'s service Alipay, China's largest) and aims to quintuple this by 2016. Some experts predict that mobile wallet users will overtake credit card users in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors in Indian e-commerce, China's growth provides evidence that the scale is real and achievable, said Mr. Gururaj of Nasscom, the Indian tech industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in China, India's smaller cities and towns lack retail infrastructure. In 5,000 cities and towns, tapping an app is the new equivalent of a visit to the mall, and it could unleash pent-up demand for the latest fashion or the newest device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India resembles China of seven to 10 years ago in its broadband Internet growth, creation of digital-native marketplaces and rapid user adoption. Even ideas like online grocers, which have just started to gain a foothold in places like Silicon Valley could do well in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So investors who won in China are playing in India. Those who missed in China, too, are playing in India. This is the land of opportunity,'' Mr. Gururaj said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 7, 2015, Thursday</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress is once again trying to reform patent law to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits that have made a mockery of the protections the government grants to inventors. This time lawmakers seem much closer to legislation that could become law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the number of patent-infringement lawsuits has increased sharply, by 25 percent just in 2013, according a study by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>. Some of these cases are between large technology companies like Apple and <span class="companylink">Samsung</span> that make competing products. But many of them are filed by businesses that have bought up lots of patents with the intention of licensing them to others. Some of these firms have been suing or threatening to sue small businesses like coffee shops and hotels demanding licensing fees for their use of off-the-shelf technology products like Wi-Fi routers that the plaintiffs claim violate their patents.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bipartisan group of senators -- including Charles Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, and Patrick Leahy, a Democrat of Vermont -- introduced a bill last week that should reduce such lawsuits. The Obama administration has expressed support for the bill, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate bill would allow the manufacturers of products like computer equipment to step in and fight claims on behalf of their customers. This should cut down on lawsuits because some patent owners sue or threaten to sue the users of technology, rather than large technology companies like <span class="companylink">Cisco Systems</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, because small businesses are more likely to settle than engage in a costly legal battle. But technology companies, not end users, are in the best position to defend their products in courts. In many cases, these businesses would want to take on such cases to protect their reputations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One important provision in the bill would allow judges to order the loser in a patent case to pay the winner's legal fees, if the case was not ''objectively reasonable.'' Currently, judges can only award fees in ''exceptional'' cases. Judges should have greater discretion to deal with frivolous and abusive cases. The Senate approach is a clear improvement over a bill approved by the House in December 2013 that went too far by requiring losers to pay attorney's fees unless judges determined that cases were ''reasonably justified'' or that special circumstances made an award unjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another provision would require patent owners who send letters alleging that a business is infringing on their patents -- a step that usually precedes the filing of lawsuits -- must clearly explain their allegations. Companies that send out letters with fraudulent or misleading information could face civil penalties levied by the <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations over a patent bill stalled in the Senate last year because some universities, technology companies, trial lawyers and pharmaceutical businesses asserted that the legislation would have gone too far in several ways, like imposing strict limits on when parties in a patent case can seek documents from the other side. Lawmakers have learned from that failure and taken the legitimate concerns of patent holders into account. The latest bill strikes a good balance and deserves approval.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber raised a total of more than $2 billion from investors in June and December last year -- and is now back for another round. The anonymous messaging start-up Yik Yak collected $73.5 million in three financing rounds in seven months, and Zenefits, a human resources start-up, raised more than $580 million in less than two years, with the latest deal done last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of technological change has long been happening at the lightning-fast speed of the Internet. Now, start-up financing is increasingly taking place at that speed as well.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber is just one example of the quickening tempo. The ride-hailing company is in discussions to raise around $1.5 billion in financing, which could value it at $50 billion. Just five months ago the company collected $1.2 billion for its war chest, an amount that later swelled with the addition of a strategic investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the rate of fund-raising by Uber -- and across the start-up landscape -- has little precedent, driven by money pouring in from hedge funds, strategic investors and more, and by the willingness of entrepreneurs to embrace the cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When capital markets are this loose, people tap them, whether it's right to or not,'' said Mark Suster, a partner at the venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Upfront Ventures</span>. ''Companies are raising rapid rounds of capital for only one reason: They can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frequency of the fund-raising by many start-ups -- now multiple rounds in months rather than years -- is ''otherwise unheard-of,'' said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm that studies venture capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shrinking time between funding rounds shows how Silicon Valley's current boom is not just about start-ups reaching a high valuation but also about how fast they can pull that off. The tempo is in marked contrast to the pace of start-up fund-raising last decade, when many companies would typically leave a year or two between financing rounds. When LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, raised money as a start-up in the mid-2000s, it took more than three years for its first three rounds of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of 2013, however, more than 20 tech start-ups have held three rounds of funding within a year and a half, according to CB Insights, which called the group the ''18-month sprint'' companies. Last year, nearly 500 tech start-ups did financing rounds less than one year apart, CB Insights estimated, more than any other year since at least 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the companies that completed numerous financings in tight time frames was the fitness membership start-up ClassPass, which completed three rounds in nine and a half months, CB Insights said. Slack, the collaboration software start-up, last month took in $160 million; just six months earlier, it had received $120 million from investors. Snapchat in December raised nearly half a billion dollars from a bevy of financiers. Just three months later, the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba poured $200 million into the messaging start-up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spurring the more frequent fund-raising is the desire of investors -- including hedge funds, mutual funds and strategic investors -- to put up money more often for fear of missing out on the next big thing. One reason Uber is in talks to raise money again just a few months after a prior round is because of an overwhelming amount of investor interest, said a person with knowledge of the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process is confidential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many institutional funds and international companies have leapt into start-up investing as the number of initial public offerings has slowed, prompting investors to wade into private companies to find growth, according to Mark A. Siegel, managing director at the venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Menlo Ventures</span>, which has invested in Uber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't blame entrepreneurs,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''This is something where investors are absolutely complicit in this, and in some ways are driving this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the phenomenon of fast fund-raising appears largely limited to the club of ''unicorns,'' or the elite companies that are worth at least $1 billion. Investments in the later financing rounds for companies jumped to $4.2 billion in the first quarter, up 50 percent from a year ago, according to data from the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>, making it the biggest quarter for such investments since late 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs are often happy to take up eager investors on their offers. Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, recently said that his start-up had more than enough money in the bank -- just before collecting $160 million more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the best time to raise money ever,'' he said last month. ''It might be the best time for any kind of business, in any industry, to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Butterfield said Slack had ''no immediate use'' for the new money it had just raised. Still, the capital ''reinforces the perception for our larger customers that we'll be around for the long haul,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parker Conrad, chief executive of Zenefits, said rapid-fire fund-raising is necessary to quickly build up a company so it is large enough to take on competitors. With the money, Zenefits has been able to persuade more than 10,000 small and midsize businesses to use its service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to grow really big, really fast,'' Mr. Conrad said in an interview last week for the company's third round of fund-raising since early 2014. ''That requires a lot of capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the numerous rounds of new cash are not put to immediate use, the money may come in handy one day if -- or when -- the free-flowing capital faucets are shut off. Investors like Bill Gurley, a partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark, have warned of an eventual reckoning, a time when money is not as easy to come by, which will cause some companies to sputter out when their bank accounts empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is to protect against this inflection point that some companies may be raising as frequently as they can, while they can, said Mr. Suster of <span class="companylink">Upfront Ventures</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some companies view these as war chests being raised to weather the inevitable corrections,'' he said. ''For now, the tide is high and nobody knows who's naked.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Small-business owners in the United States gained confidence in April and were surprisingly bullish about capital expenditure plans, further supporting views that economic growth is rebounding after a dismal first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department also reported on Tuesday that job openings fell in March.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span> said on Tuesday that its Small Business Optimism Index rose 1.7 points to 96.9 last month. It was the largest gain since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses historically have accounted for half of private gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is clawing back after being hit by a mix of bad weather, disruptions at ports, a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on employment and consumer sentiment have suggested a pickup in growth momentum at the start of the second quarter, but the dollar and lower oil prices continue to weigh on manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine of the 10 components of the federation's index rose last month, with the exception of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In spite of the dramatic reversal of economic activity in the energy sector, owners in the shale states remained substantially more aggressive than their counterparts in the other states,'' the group said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall business investment has sagged. Energy companies cut capital expenditure budgets and laid off thousands of workers as lower energy prices undermined exploration and drilling activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federation's survey of 1,500 companies found that 60 percent reported capital outlays, a postrecession high. Of those making expenditures, 44 percent said they had bought new equipment, up four percentage points. About 26 percent of owners planned capital outlays in the next three to six months, up two percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bolsters views that the bulk of the energy spending cuts were front-loaded into the first quarter and hopes that capital spending outside the energy sector will spring back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government initially estimated that the economy grew at a rate of 0.2 percent in the first quarter. Data on trade and wholesale inventories, however, suggest the economy contracted in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federation's survey also found an increase in the number of owners saying that stocks of goods were too low and that they had plans to increase inventory investment. This could be positive for growth in the second quarter after businesses amassed huge stocks at the start of the year, which was seen as at least partly unintended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners were downbeat on sales, but surprisingly optimistic about earnings. The survey's labor market indicators showed further signs that the job market was tightening; there was an increase in the share of owners saying they could not find qualified workers for open job positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department report said job openings in March slipped 150,000 to five million, in line with weak payroll growth that month. Openings were up 18.6 percent from a year ago, however, and the overall trend painted a solid employment picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was an increase in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, a sign of confidence in the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Confidence in the labor market has obviously returned,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at <span class="companylink">MUFG Union Bank</span> in New York. ''People are quitting their jobs because they have options and opportunities."</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through three decades, Jerry Weiss wore coats and ties to the offices where he managed credit risks at the nation's biggest banks -- a 50-story <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> tower in Queens and the 60-story Chase Manhattan Plaza in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Weiss, who is 57, works out of a tiny two-room office in the Flatiron district, home of the start-up small-business lender he joined last year, where his younger colleagues make fun of his New Balance sneakers and ''dad jeans.'' His bosses at the start-up, Bond Street, are a pair of apple-cheeked <span class="companylink">Harvard</span> graduates; and the average age of his seven colleagues is 28.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The culture collision reflects the latest challenge to big banks, in which risk-taking and jobs are flowing to dozens of new alternative lenders. The start-ups aim to reinvent small-business and consumer lending by offering quicker approvals, relying on automated credit checks that include data feeds from bank accounts and tax returns, salted with inputs from social media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the new businesses still need a few grizzled veterans who have lived through downturns and have learned what can go wrong. Louis Beryl, the chief executive of Earnest, a consumer lending start-up, said, ''When you're raising a lot of money from debt investors, they want to see someone who's been through multiple credit cycles.'' Earnest has a 45-year-old chief risk officer who previously worked at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss, in an interview at Bond Street's office, said, ''I have seen many online lenders who are bringing in some bright young people into the role I am doing, but they are folks who have never made a loan in their lives.'' He added, ''They think it's all science and math, but they've never been through a recession.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond Street is one of 25 digital small-business lenders that rely heavily on data analysis in making decisions, aiming at a market with $300 billion in outstanding loans, according to a report in April by Autonomous Research. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span> and several dozen other new lenders compete for an additional $450 billion in consumer and student loans. Such marketplace loans have risen from $1.2 billion in 2012 to $9 billion last year, according to Foundation Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond Street was founded in October 2013 by David Haber, 27, its chief executive, who had investing experience at two firms, and Peyton Sherwood, 33, its chief technology officer, who had been a computer science major.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haber, a San Diego native whose father managed a small department store in Tijuana, Mexico, previously worked at Spark Capital, where he helped partners invest in alternative lending start-ups like Orchard and Behalf, and the bank-data start-up Plaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't hurt that Mr. Haber's father-in-law, George Hornig, a Wall Street veteran of Wasserstein Perella vintage, made an angel investment in Bond Street and an introduction to the securities firm Jefferies, which will supply funds for the firm's lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to reinvent the small-business lending process, but we realized we didn't have a credit background,'' said Mr. Haber, who wants Bond Street to be faster, simpler and more open than banks. His firm offers loans of $50,000 to $500,000 at annual rates of 8 to 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he canvassed bank lending executives before starting Bond Street, Mr. Haber spoke with two Orchard founders, who had both worked for Mr. Weiss on <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s small-business risk team from 2009 to 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people his age and his level of experience would work at a very high-altitude level and not get into the details,'' said David Snitkoff, one of the Orchard founders. ''But Jerry also gets his hands dirty and gets things done on the ground.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss had previously worked in credit cards at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, and in small-business and branch-bank credit risk at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. In 2000, he helped with the creation of a small-business credit database shared by a half-dozen big banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Far Rockaway, Queens, Mr. Weiss grew up in suburban Chappaqua, N.Y., attended Reed College in Portland, Ore., acquired a taste for the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead, and later earned a business degree at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. Though he wears T-shirts and sweaters to the office, as his colleagues do, he does have a thick gray beard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was definitely a thought we had at the beginning -- he's a little bit older than most start-up people,'' Mr. Sherwood said. But Eddie Serrill, Bond Street's head of business development, said Mr. Weiss had ''jumped in with both feet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss has thrown himself into team building, manning the grill at a cookout to celebrate Bond Street's first loan, arranging for water-skiing at the firm's first off-site meeting at a borrowed Hamptons rental house last summer and helping with a recent paintball event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the big banks, Mr. Weiss sometimes seemed like ''a cog in the wheel of upper management,'' said his longtime friend, the food photographer Allen Owens. What's more, Mr. Weiss chafed at being considered one of ''the new villains,'' with bankers being blamed for the 2008 financial crisis, his son Aaron said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss himself recalled being stuck in ''endless meetings and endless levels of approvals for everything.'' At <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, he said, it took three years to develop a small-business underwriting platform and 18 more months to put it into operation. He added, ''I wanted to break free and have fun again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the going hasn't always been smooth. Bond Street had to freeze new loans between last December and April while it sought new investors and loan sources. It recently obtained an infusion of new venture capital and a Wall Street lending facility that will allow the hiring of 25 employees over the next 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such alternative lending does have its skeptics. ''It's high-risk lending, an accident waiting to happen,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst at RBC Capital. One sign of risk came in a March report by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, which pointed out that the loan approval rate of new small-business lenders is 62 percent, much higher than the 21 percent at traditional big banks. Others worry that borrowers might skip the payments on such loans more readily than they would with other forms of debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recognizing the risk, Mr. Weiss is bringing a distinctive quantitative approach to alternative lending. He has helped design Bond Street's loan approval process to reflect automated inputs from credit bureaus, bank accounts, tax filings and QuickBooks online financial statements. The process also includes targets like expected profits of 1.2 times debt service. After seeing five past delinquencies in one applicant's report, he observed, ''This is a decline.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he also values personal contact with applicants to gauge their path to profitability. A coffee shop owner who was hoping to consolidate $55,000 in credit card debt into a new loan of $100,000 said on a call that he was seeking the money for ''capital expenses, new hires and to load up the shelves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weiss asked about the shop owner's latest tax filings and QuickBooks updates, and about a new baby, who was audible in the background. ''Customers like talking to the chief credit officer,'' he said after the call. ''And I love hearing their stories.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDFor the May 3 special issue on money, Gideon Lewis-­Kraus told the story of the rise and fall of a Kickstarter company called ZPM Espresso -- the ''home-­espresso-­machine mega-­failure that came to define the crowdfunding era of specialty coffee tech,'' in the words of an aggregator named Sprudge Wire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding outlets like Kickstarter provide opportunities for entrepreneurs who lack access to venture capital and for modest backers who want to share in the creation of a cool product. But ZPM Espresso's story raised deeper questions about how to interpret crowdfunding failure. (''Because everything that gets posted on Kickstarter is supposed to be a smashing success?'' one reader asked on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some readers expressed sympathy for the founders, whose dreams of a better coffee machine unraveled before they could even distribute a product, leaving them open to vitriol from their backers. ''I feel for these guys,'' Karolina, a reader, wrote on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. ''We have all heard plenty about how there are no jobs for many of these bright, university-­educated people,'' a commenter identified as VR wrote on nytimes.com. ''Why discourage their attempts to make work for themselves?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any investment carries risk, but who is to blame when one doesn't pay off? Over at Hacker News, some readers chided the investors. ''Your spidey sense should be better tuned to the markers of projects headed for failure, like the lack of hard and technical details, too much optimism,'' a commenter identified as jkestner wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of ZPM Espresso's original backers weighed in on their experiences with the company. ''They had bad business sense and burned through cash on several bad decisions,'' wrote one Hacker News commenter. ''Throughout the project, they never mentioned that the founding engineer had left the company or any other of their most serious issues,'' wrote another backer, who said he found ZPM Espresso's mistakes excusable. ''But the dishonesty and the almost total lack of transparence makes the rancor of some backers very understandable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rancor was noisy and perhaps drowned out more moderate voices. A ''very vocal minority makes all backers seem mad and aggressive -- basically a couple of trolls set the tone,'' wrote another Hacker News commenter, paulftw. ''Maybe if everyone who felt the other way would be as proactive in expressing their opinions to founders, it would change at least the emotional outcome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the way we respond to failure is more revealing than the failure itself. ''It's often said that Silicon Valley works, in part, because of its acceptance of failures,'' a commenter identified as Jacob­Aldridge wrote on Hacker News. ''This is a witch hunt that says more about the hunters than those they are chasing.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEDAR FALLS, Iowa -- For close to an hour on Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton talked with owners of small businesses here about the issues on their minds, like whether they would enjoy better access to credit if small local banks were given regulatory relief and whether a major trade deal up for debate in Washington could wind up hurting American workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for president, took a handful of questions from reporters, and the topics were sharply different, and sharper in tone: her personal wealth, her use of a private email while she was secretary of state, her family foundation's acceptance of foreign donations and the 2003 invasion in Iraq. She called her own vote in the Senate to authorize the invasion ''a mistake.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Clinton is adhering to a campaign schedule dotted with regular round-table sessions as she delves into the concerns of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. More often than not, though, she avoids engaging with the journalists covering her campaign, a practice that has drawn criticism in recent weeks from Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, who is a likely Republican presidential candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's event and the question-and-answer session after it -- her first since April 21 -- underscored the tension between Mrs. Clinton's desire to establish a comfortable rapport with voters on issues she believes they care about and journalists' intent to question her about stories that have dogged her nascent campaign, threatening to throw her off message. All candidates face that push and pull for control of their campaign narrative, but it is more pronounced in Mrs. Clinton's case because of the way she dominates the Democratic field so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Clinton opened the round-table discussion here, at a specialty bike shop, with a call to help small businesses expand their access to credit -- and hire more workers -- by relieving small community banks of some regulatory hindrances. ''Isn't that doable?'' she asked to nods of approval. ''Am I right about that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said community banks had been hard hit by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donna J. Sorensen, chairwoman of the Cedar Rapids Bank and Trust, agreed. ''We are losing those at a rapid rate, about 10 every year in Iowa,'' Ms. Sorensen said. ''We exist to support small businesses. Small businesses are our bread and butter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another participant, Brad Magg, the owner of an ice cream shop and catering business, said he had opened his first restaurant at age 20 ''with a bank loan from my local bank across the street because the bank president knew me, knew my work ethic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Clinton drew a distinction between relieving the pressure on smaller banks and deregulating big Wall Street banks, a policy that she faulted some Republicans for supporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What was meant to rein in 'too big to fail' has actually fallen harder on them,'' she said of community banks. ''That's why they need relief, because they were not part of the problem but in some ways are paying a disproportionate price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the participants asked Mrs. Clinton about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which the Obama administration is negotiating and which liberals have pressed her to oppose. She acknowledged that ''this is obviously a very hot topic right now'' but avoided saying whether she would come down for or against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any trade deal I would support must increase jobs, must increase wages, must give us more economic competitive power,'' Mrs. Clinton said, repeating her earlier contention that it was too early to tell whether the pact would meet her threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have been for trade agreements. I have been against trade agreements,'' she said. ''I try to make a valuation dependent on what they would produce.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Clinton was equally coy after a reporter for Fox News called out to her with a request to take questions from reporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I might,'' she said, smiling. ''I have to ponder it. I will put it on my list for due consideration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she began to answer a handful of questions, Mrs. Clinton made a modicum of news. She said she hoped the State Department would release her personal emails as soon as possible. (''As much as they can expedite the process, that's what I'm asking them to do.'') She defended her family's philanthropic foundation. (''I'll let the American people make their own judgments'' about foreign donations.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about current conflict in Iraq, which has stumped Mr. Bush and some other Republican contenders lately, and whether the world would be better off had Saddam Hussein remained in power, Mrs. Clinton demurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I made a mistake, plain and simple,'' in voting to authorize the 2003 invasion, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She defended her relationship with Sidney Blumenthal, a White House adviser to former President Bill Clinton and a longtime confidant, who was paid by the <span class="companylink">Clinton Foundation</span> and offered advice to Mrs. Clinton about the situation in Libya while she was secretary of state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always think that it's important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what's on their mind,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At every step in her campaign so far, Mrs. Clinton has voiced a populist message about helping ordinary Americans, saying the ''deck is stacked'' against them and in favor of the very wealthy. Tuesday was no different: ''Something is wrong when C.E.O.s earn more than 300 times what the typical American worker earns,'' she said in the round-table discussion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the first time, Mrs. Clinton was asked afterward how she could relate to voters struggling to get by, given the $25 million that she and her husband reported in income from paid speeches since the beginning of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, Bill and I have been blessed, and we are very grateful for the opportunities,'' she said. ''I'm running a campaign that is very clearly stating we want to reshuffle the deck.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the residents of Ypsilanti, Mich., Beezy's Cafe looks like a thriving business. The six-year-old restaurant and coffeehouse draws crowds for breakfast and lunch, employs 16 people, has a trail of glowing Yelp reviews for its ''hippy vibe'' and ''super friendly'' staff, and recently extended its hours to serve dinner on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to banks, it's a risky venture with little appeal. Beezy's is only intermittently profitable, and most of the cash it generates goes straight back into keeping it running. Bee Roll, the cafe's founder and owner, has no collateral to offer for a loan or credit line: She rents her home and leases the restaurant's space and some of its equipment. Nearly everything in the cafe -- including the eclectic local art on its walls -- is scavenged, borrowed or bartered.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most valuable thing Beezy's has is its loyal customers. Now, in a novel lending experiment, it is testing a new system for quantifying customers' devotion and turning it into an asset that can be monetized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cafe is the first guinea pig for ZipCap, a fledgling start-up in San Diego with a new lending model it calls ''loyalty capital.'' The aim is to offer small retailers like restaurants, boutiques and service providers access to low-interest loans financed by investors with a vested interest in supporting a local economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of ZipCap's system is the idea that successful merchants have a network of repeat customers with strong connections to their favorite neighborhood businesses. Such buyers, the theory goes, can be encouraged to give those businesses a predictable sales stream -- one that, if it is documented and tracked, will give lenders a reasonable picture of a business's ability to repay a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipCap's merchants start by recruiting an ''Inner Circle'' of customers who pledge to spend a set amount of money in a fixed period of time. ZipCap then tallies up those pledges and allows businesses to borrow against a portion of it. To be eligible for loans, companies must have been in business for at least two years in the same location and must enroll at least 100 Inner Circle members. Participants pay ZipCap a monthly fee of either $99 or 2.5 percent of their Inner Circle transactions, whichever is lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Beezy's, Ms. Roll signed up 130 Inner Circle members. Each committed to spend $475 a year. In March, she became ZipCap's first borrower, taking out a $10,000 loan with a 12-month repayment schedule and an annual percentage rate of 3.99 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rock-bottom rate is far below those available through credit cards or the growing field of alternative small-business lenders that offer financing to entrepreneurs who do not qualify for traditional loans. (Ms. Roll said two local banks had declined her credit applications.) Ms. Roll said that for her, ZipCap's biggest appeal was the link it helped forge between her business and its most devoted customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want access to cheap money so I can keep doing great things for the community,'' she said. ''When I started explaining the pledge concept, people were like, 'This is going to help you? Great, I'm in!' It really makes it clear how vital their support is to us. There's trust, and an ongoing relationship.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Malter, ZipCap's founder and chief executive, considers the relationship aspect of ZipCap's system just as important as the ''cheap money'' part. ''We want people to see the impact they have on their local economy,'' he said. ''When a customer feels as though they have contributed to the success of a business, they have a greater bond to that business and are more compelled to visit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZipCap's unusual lending model, Mr. Malter said, emerged from his desire to fix flaws in other small-business financing options, particularly interest rates so high that he considers them predatory. It is also the result of trial-and-error experimentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malter initially set out to create a very different venture: an equity crowdfunding site that would help business owners raise capital from their customers. But the more he learned about how neighborhood retailers operate, the less he liked that idea. Razor-thin margins leave little room for investor profit, he realized, and merchants' accounting systems are often messy and ad hoc. ''How a pizza shop owner is running the business is not something anyone can do due diligence on, much less the crowd,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he started over, focusing on the issues that often prevent small-business owners from obtaining affordable loans: lack of collateral and low (or nonexistent) profitability. ''By using customer loyalty as collateral and an asset, we're creating an accounts receivable stream for the kinds of businesses that otherwise have none,'' Mr. Malter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question on which the entire model hinges, though, is how reliable customers' spending pledges turn out to be. ZipCap has 10 Michigan businesses in various stages of a pilot program and is tracking their Inner Circle follow-through rates. At Beezy's, five months in, 117 members -- 90 percent of the group -- are on pace to fulfill their pledges. Nine have already done so and renewed for another $475 commitment. One member dropped out, and 12 are falling short of their target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To succeed, ZipCap will need to sell both merchants and investors on its loyalty capital concept and prove that it is an effective way to underwrite loans. Robert Foster, a veteran of the impact investing industry and a board member of the Social Venture Network, says the start-up is one he is keeping a close eye on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a challenging pool of applicants to lend to,'' Mr. Foster said. ''You're essentially an unsecured creditor. ZipCap believes that social pressure is enough to keep people doing the right thing, to keep customers fulfilling their pledges and borrowers paying back their loans. The $1 million question for me is: Is that glue really strong enough?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Bennett, an investment analyst with the VilCap Investments, a fund that focuses on early stage, mission-driven enterprises, described ZipCap with the quip: ''Evan's doing his best to find every single George Bailey in the country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a risky, idealistic approach, but in areas with the right combination of civically minded consumers, entrepreneurs and investors, it could take hold, Mr. Bennett said. The Detroit metropolitan area, where ZipCap is focusing now, is an ideal testing ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Stewart W. Beal, a 12-year Ypsilanti resident who lives four blocks from Beezy's, heard about the Inner Circle program, he and his wife immediately signed up. He's a fan of the cafe's chicken club sandwiches, and an even bigger fan of the role Beezy's plays in the neighborhood. Mr. Beal, who runs a real estate development and construction firm, frequently holds business meetings at the cafe, and his wife stops by often with their 2-year-old daughter. He said he was delighted to see a once-vacant building turn into a local hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm an entrepreneur,'' Mr. Beal said. ''I've borrowed money before, and at times I've struggled to borrow money. So I got this right away. I think it could work very well for businesses like this that are supported by the community.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 71, Mr. Burrows could be forgiven if he decided to fold his tent. But instead he is the most recent and famous member of a clique of fashion designers and brand stewards who have turned to crowdfunding, the e-commerce platform that pools backers to underwrite products that do not and may never exist.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Pinto, who was dressing Michelle Obama long before she left Chicago, was one of the first, drumming up $272,523 in a 2013 campaign on Kickstarter that drew 624 backers and enabled a ready-to-wear line, M2057.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other designers and brand developers, some with multiple campaigns, have included Ivana Lo Stimolo and Gregory Halverson of Anne Fogarty, who raised $30,062; Paskho's Patrick Robinson, $68,770; Jennifer Chang and Roman Khan of Linjer leather goods, $201,760; the milliner Satya Twena, $262,969; and the poster boy of fashion crowdfunding, Flint and Tinder's Jake Bronstein, $1,670,538.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My goal is $300,000,'' Mr. Burrows said in a recent interview, still snake-hipped after all these years and sounding upbeat. ''Either I reach it by June 6 and get the money, or I don't reach it and I don't get the money.'' He is collaborating with his housemate Veronica Jones, his buyer at Joseph Magnin nearly 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, Kickstarter, whose website is hosting Mr. Burrows's venture, reported almost $9,000 in pledges from 27 supporters, with nine days to go. Following the established model, he is enticing backers with a range of ''perks,'' as they are called, or ''rewards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one of Ms. Twena's campaigns, for example, a $99 pledge ''bought'' a sun hat (and a few extras) that soon after retailed for $225. Ms. Pinto lured benefactors with a dress or jacket for a vow of $250, an excellent value by any measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $45, Mr. Robinson, late of Armani Exchange and the Gap, promised a tank top. (In an email from Cambodia, Mr. Robinson said his second Paskho collection of men's and women's urban action wear would be sold through the company's website beginning in late August.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, Mr. Burrows's reward for a contribution of $200 -- a handwritten thank-you card and a signed copy of a book about him -- may seem a little thin. (''When Fashion Danced'' was available for $24.05 through Amazon.) The card, the book, a scarf, a T-shirt and a ticket to a projected runway show come with a $5,000 donation. The only real article of clothing being dangled, a color-blocked tunic, is part of a package that, at just a thread under $10,000, may require a call to your financial adviser before you click the pledge box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having offered a dress for $197, I learned that the sweet spot for a pledge is $99,'' said Mr. Halverson, who with his wife, Ms. Lo Stimolo, scooped up the lapsed Anne Fogarty trademark for the price of registering it. Ms. Fogarty, who died in 1980, owed much of her career to Dior's wasp-waisted, multipetticoated <span class="companylink">New Look</span>, interpreting it in humbler fabrics and simplifying construction. (She was also the author of a still-in-print book, ''Wife Dressing: The Fine Art of Being a Well-Dressed Wife,'' that despite its regressive title has not lost relevance, according to Ms. Lo Stimolo.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halverson, who helped with the initial public offerings of Prada and Ferragamo while working for Banca IMI in Milan, said, ''I paid my son to identify and contact every seller of vintage Fogarty on <span class="companylink">Etsy</span> to find out what the name means to them.'' He called his foray onto Kickstarter a ''break-even exercise'' that has helped court investors for a full-scale Anne Fogarty revival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While financing is the obvious reason to crowdfund, companies like <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> use it mostly or purely as a marketing tool. Given Mr. Burrows's near-legendary status, it may seem that in hitching himself to Kickstarter, his aim is to build buzz and show that he is at least as up-to-date as Public School's Maxwell Osborne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, as noted on Mr. Burrows's plea page, he is ''challenged by limited access to capital.'' Unlike Shaquille O'Neal, who mustered $458,884 for a video game, he is not one of those crowdfund opportunists who ''can't even pretend to be in financial binds worthy of public contribution,'' as Grace McClure of Celery, the preorder platform, wrote in February. If Mr. Burrows does not attain his dollar goal, his comeback will be postponed -- or canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My last collection was financed by rich friends,'' he said. ''I pitched my model to numerous investors, but this time no one stepped up. It did and didn't surprise me. Fashion is a difficult business. Taxing. Tedious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he has a Plan B, Mr. Burrows laughed. ''I'm sure I'll think of something,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter and its challengers, Indiegogo and GoFundMe, don't make it easy for people as fabulous as Mr. Burrows, or as aesthetically attuned as Ms. Chang and Mr. Khan, the couple behind Linjer. The three platforms are bare-bones in design, far from the plush, privileged, airy-fairy universe of <span class="companylink">Moda Operandi</span>, or even the simple charms of a J. Crew catalog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choosing a project to support is as sexy as bidding for stamps on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. The company that Linjer's beautifully finished soft briefcases and passport wallets is asked to keep on Indiegogo's ''fashion'' pages includes ''everyday shirts for the shorter guy,'' moisture-wicking nipple shields and baseball caps with unprintable slogans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khan was quick to point out that outfits like No Nips aren't his only problem neighbors. ''Indiegogo is dominated by geeks looking for the next big idea and the tech guys who think they have it,'' he said. ''It's hard to find anyone talking about how gorgeous full-grain vegetable-tanned leather is.'' Mr. Khan stressed the need for luxury brands to build a corps of potential backers before accepting contributions. ''Ninety-nine percent of the people who allowed us to hit our first campaign goal of $50,000 within 48 hours were from the community we brought with us,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pinto said of Kickstarter: ''It's a techie crowd. Lots of digital watches. As a designer, you've got to come in with a loaded gun: your own network. It's a hustle. The typical audience for these platforms is not the fashion customer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slava Rubin, co-founder and chief executive of Indiegogo, pointed out: ''<span class="companylink">EBay</span> started out selling Pez dispensers and Beanie Babies. Now they have multimillion-dollar homes and cars.'' Ten years ago, he added, ''there were companies that wouldn't touch <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Every industry will become comfortable with crowdfunding at its own speed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 9,000 backers underwrote Jake Bronstein's drive for a hoodie with a 10-year guarantee. With an average pledge of $114, it is Kickstarter's only $1 million fashion venture thus far. Mr. Bronstein started subsequent campaigns with the company for men's underwear and ''denim on demand'' custom jeans before taking crowdfunding into his own hands. Rejiggering Magento platform software for his Flint and Tinder website, Mr. Bronstein financed a poplin safari shirt and swim trunks he is convinced can double as shorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The upside of independence is lower payment processing fees,'' he said. ''The downside, fewer eyeballs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another upside: no brand adjacencies, like the guy who makes the offensive caps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Indiegogo is a democratic, completely open platform, just like <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> or <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''There are no gatekeepers. The last thing fashion people want is to be judged.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY, Australia -- In November 2013, John Locke and Nate Niparko, two members of the investment team at the American venture capital firm <span class="companylink">Accel Partners</span>, got off a plane here and jumped in a taxi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They told the driver to take them to Erina, a sleepy coastal town 57 miles north. Erina was an unlikely home of one of the world's most popular invoicing apps for small businesses, <span class="companylink">Invoice2go</span>, created by Chris Strode, a 40-year old programmer with a passion for surfing.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess John and Nate wondered what they had wandered into when they arrived in Erina,'' Mr. Strode recalled. ''But they told me they are always on the lookout for companies getting traction organically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Accel</span>, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., invested $25 million in <span class="companylink">Invoice2go</span> last year along with another Silicon Valley investor, Ribbit Capital, which invested $10 million. <span class="companylink">Invoice2go</span> has 200,000 customers, a chief executive from <span class="companylink">Accel</span>, Greg Waldorf, plus a new office in Palo Alto with 28 employees, Mr. Strode said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Accel</span> is not alone in its interest in Australia. United States venture capital firms invested $240.7 million in the country in the year that ended June 30, 2014, more than three times the amount invested by Australian firms in the same period, according to the <span class="companylink">Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firms like <span class="companylink">Accel</span>, Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures, <span class="companylink">Insight Venture Partners</span>, the hedge fund Matrix Capital Management and the private equity giant <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> are scouring investment opportunities in Australia and New Zealand, attracted by a familiar legal and regulatory environment and few competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Entrepreneurship is alive and well outside Silicon Valley,'' said Ryan Sweeney, a partner at <span class="companylink">Accel</span>. ''We pride ourselves on our hustle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last four years, <span class="companylink">Accel</span> has invested about $200 million in six Australian and New Zealand companies: <span class="companylink">Atlassian</span>, Xero, Campaign Monitor, <span class="companylink">Invoice2go</span>, <span class="companylink">99designs</span> and <span class="companylink">OzForex</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the Aussie company, Silicon Valley offers a network of expertise and business contacts that Australian venture capital firms just can't compete with,'' said Patrick Llewellyn, chief executive of <span class="companylink">99designs</span>, an online marketplace for crowdsourced graphic designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, few venture capital firms in the country can write the kind of checks that their United States counterparts can. In 2010, <span class="companylink">Accel</span> invested $60 million in <span class="companylink">Atlassian</span>, a software company that other companies use to build their own software. <span class="companylink">Insight Venture Partners</span> last year invested $250 million in Campaign Monitor, which makes software for email marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Early stage capital is readily available in Australia, but if you're looking for more than $5 million as an Australian start-up, you're likely to look overseas,'' said Tessa Court, the founder and chief executive of IntelligenceBank, a six-year-old business software company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dearth of Australian venture capital money often means rich pickings for United States investors. By the time Australian start-ups are willing to take a call from Silicon Valley, the success of their business models has caught the attention of Sand Hill Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sweeney and another <span class="companylink">Accel</span> partner, Rich Wong, flew to Sydney to have lunch with <span class="companylink">Atlassian</span>'s co-founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, after the firm began to hear that its portfolio companies were using <span class="companylink">Atlassian</span> software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Invoice2go</span> had more than 100,000 customers and 25 employees, many commuting daily from Sydney, when <span class="companylink">Accel</span> called on Mr. Strode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xero, a New Zealand cloud accounting company, had a different approach to raising money from many other Australian and New Zealand start-ups. Xero's chief executive, Rod Drury, raised $11.8 million through an initial public offering within nine months of starting it in July 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drury has also been courted by hedge funds and venture capital firms as he has sought to finance the company's global expansion. Xero has raised $373.2 million through the public markets and investments from individuals and venture capital firms like Valar Ventures and the hedge fund <span class="companylink">Matrix Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hedge funds are getting on the plane early to invest in promising start-ups,'' Mr. Drury said. ''Venture capital funds have moved to later-stage investing, seeking to get liquidity faster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reputations of <span class="companylink">Accel</span> and Insight Ventures after their investments in some of the most successful Australian start-ups has helped in the pursuit of their next deals in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Farquhar of <span class="companylink">Atlassian</span> introduced <span class="companylink">Accel</span> and Insight Ventures to SafetyCulture, which runs a safety audit app that has been used more than 12 million times worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luke Anear started SafetyCulture in his garage in his hometown, Townsville, in Australia's tropical northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''U.S. V.C.s are willing to meet people wherever they are as they know opportunities are coming out of garages around the world,'' Mr. Anear said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, President Obama signed a law that he called a ''potential game changer'' for entrepreneurs seeking financing to start or expand a business: Small companies looking for financial backers could advertise their offerings online, and average people -- not just wealthy accredited investors -- would be allowed to buy stakes in businesses they found promising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three years later, entrepreneurs are still waiting for federal regulators to finish drafting the long-overdue rules that would let that part of the law take effect. Now, state agencies and lawmakers, tired of waiting, are taking action, passing crowdfunding laws and regulations to let local businesses raise money from local residents.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movement is growing. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have enacted such rules, nine of them in the last six months. Eleven states are considering creating such laws and procedures. Three more states -- Florida, Illinois and New Mexico -- have rules or legislation awaiting the governor's signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's exploded this year,'' said Anthony Zeoli, a lawyer in Chicago who has been tracking the status of the states' legislation on his blog. ''People are clamoring for it, and those who see the power of it are pushing these agendas forward. I mean, who can say no to legislation designed to help open up capital for small and growing businesses?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state-level rules have heavy restrictions, the biggest of which is that companies may raise money only from investors in their own states. In Texas, where intrastate crowdfunding became legal in November, that gives entrepreneurs access to around 20 million potential investors; in Vermont, only 500,000 or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of money companies can raise is also relatively small. The rules vary by state, but most limit the total to $1 million or $2 million, and the amount any individual investor is permitted to give is typically capped at $10,000 or less. (Accredited investors, those with an annual income exceeding $200,000 or a net worth of at least $1 million, play by a different set of rules and may invest larger sums.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those rules give some small companies plenty of room to find the financing they need. In Madison, Wis., a three-year-old brewery called MobCraft recently took advantage of a new law to raise $67,000 in growth capital from 52 Wisconsin residents, nearly all of them first-time business investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of equity crowdfunding is still new and often confusing for the companies and their investors, Henry Schwartz, a co-founder of MobCraft, acknowledged. He initially planned to raise money with a donation-based crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, until he learned that those sites do not allow alcohol to be given away as a reward. Shopping around for an alternative, he encountered CraftFund. It is one of the first sites in Wisconsin to be licensed as an equity crowdfunding portal, where state residents with cash to invest can browse through ventures seeking capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backers on sites like Kickstarter are essentially giving money away in return for products and other perks. On the rare occasion that one of those projects becomes wildly lucrative -- like <span class="companylink">Oculus VR</span>, the virtual reality start-up <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> acquired for $2 billion last year -- the crowdfunding backers don't share in the profits. Equity crowdfunders, however, receive actual shares in the companies they back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MobCraft made 2 percent of the company's equity available for purchase during its crowdfunding campaign, with a minimum investment of $525. Potential investors were given a 13-page disclosure document detailing the company's history, financial background and growth plans. Nine of those pages, Mr. Schwartz said, were an analysis of risk factors laying out ''every bad scenario you could ever imagine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been one of the biggest concerns for regulators trying to write rules. Small companies are inherently risky investments -- only half survive for five years, according to government data -- and private businesses are not required to disclose much about how they operate. It can be nearly impossible for potential investors to really know what risks they face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some rely on an old-fashioned kind of due diligence: community reputation. Staci Fritz, a Madison resident who invested $4,000 in MobCraft, runs her own food business in the area, Calliope Ice Cream. ''I see the MobCraft guys out at all these local events; I know how hard they're working it,'' she said. ''Their beer is amazing, and people here love their concept. I don't see how it could fail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While state officials are bullish on equity crowdfunding, entrepreneurs and investors have been slower to join in. Around 95 companies nationwide have filed applications to raise money using the state laws, according to data compiled by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> from state regulators. Few states track how many businesses completed their offerings, or raised the sums they sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many states, businesses are encouraged -- and in some cases, required -- to advertise their offerings through online portals. Dozens have opened in the last year. In Texas, potential investors will be able buy their own piece of an oil well through Crudefunders and browse real estate deals on MassVenture. People interested in investing in restaurants can shop the listings on EquityEats (District of Columbia) and CraftFund (Wisconsin), while those looking to explore ventures in a variety of fields can peruse truCrowd (Texas), HoosierCrowd (Indiana), Michigan Funders and Hatch Oregon, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all of those sites, however, look like ghost towns. David Lilenfeld, who in 2013 created the nation's first intrastate crowdfunding portal, SterlingFunder in Georgia, recently stopped accepting new equity crowdfunding deals on the site. In more than two years, only one of the companies he worked with raised the money it sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got all of the pieces in place except for one thing: the investors,'' he said. ''I think there's a lack of awareness about equity crowdfunding from the target audience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those in the field say they hope that will change when the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> finally issues the rules that will let fund-raising take place on a national level -- although many are pessimistic about the cost and complexity of the rules the agency outlined in a 2013 draft proposal. An S.E.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on when final rules would be issued. Mary Jo White, the agency's chairwoman, said in a recent speech that it was on the agenda for action this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The businesses that have been the most successful at using the local laws to raise money tend to be those with existing networks of eager supporters. In Kansas, for example -- which in 2011 became the first state to legalize equity crowdfunding -- the state's ''Invest Kansas'' law has supported fund-raising campaigns for a microbrewery in Emporia and a grocery store in Minneola, a small, rural community that was left without a grocery after its previous one closed in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 200 people bought shares for $50 each to raise the $150,000 needed to start Hometown Market. The store, which opened in 2012, now has sales of about $20,000 a week and five full-time employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project illustrates the economic power of tapping local investors to back local companies, said Luke Jaeger, a farmer and the chairman of the market's governing board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It provides local jobs,'' he said. ''And there's around $16,000 in sales tax dollars that we've kept that would otherwise have flowed out to other areas. It helps keep the streets up and the water lines and sewers maintained. It's really nice to retain that within the community.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.T.C. says Erik Chevalier advertised in May 2012 that he planned to produce a board game called ''The Doom That Came to Atlantic City,'' designed by two prominent board game artists. In all, 1,246 people gave pledges of $75 or more to Mr. Chevalier. The project was expected to conclude within six months.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than deliver copies of the game or promised pewter figurines to those donors, as he had promised to do once he reached his $35,000 goal, Mr. Chevalier took in money until he had raised nearly four times that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then announced in July 2013 that the project had been canceled. He pledged to deliver refunds; they never arrived, nor did any of the promised mementos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chevalier instead put that money toward moving himself to Portland, Ore., paying his rent and financing licenses for unrelated projects, according to the F.T.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many consumers enjoy the opportunity to take part in the development of a product or service through crowdfunding, and they generally know there's some uncertainty involved in helping start something new,'' said Jessica Rich, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection. ''But consumers should able to trust their money will actually be spent on the project they funded.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement is the first action the agency has taken involving such a funding scheme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Kickstarter policies seek to protect against fraud, stipulating that participants must have a ''clear goal'' and must deliver a return to the funders. If a fund-raiser on the site does not raise sufficient money within a designated time period, the fund-raiser receives no money and no backer is charged, according to the F.T.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the case on Thursday, David Gallagher, a Kickstarter spokesman, wrote in an email: ''Kickstarter creators have an incredible track record when it comes to following through on their promises. But creators who abuse our system and backers' trust expose themselves to legal action.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gallagher noted that another game maker had stepped in to produce the game and deliver it to Mr. Chevalier's backers, calling that ''a testament to the good will and spirit of the Kickstarter community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the settlement, Mr. Chevalier is prohibited ''from making misrepresentations about any crowdfunding campaign and from failing to honor stated refund policies.'' The F.T.C. settlement also imposed a $111,794 judgment, though it was suspended because of his inability to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Defendant promised consumers that he would provide an accounting of his expenses, but he has not done so,'' the F.T.C. complaint read. ''Consumers continue to file complaints regarding defendant's failure to provide the promised products and rewards, or refunds.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Novorossiya Humanitarian Battalion boasts on its website that it provided funds to buy a pair of binoculars used by rebels in eastern Ukraine to spot and destroy an armored vehicle. Another group, Save the Donbass, solicits donations using a photograph of a mortar shell inscribed with its web address and the names of donors. Yet another, Veche, states that its mission is to ''create modern, combat-ready'' military units fighting Ukraine's central government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These organizations are part of an online campaign that is brazenly raising money for the war in eastern Ukraine, using common tactics that have at least tacit support from the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Although they often portray their mission as humanitarian, most of the groups explicitly endorse the armed insurgency and vow to help equip forces in the two regions at the center of the fighting, Donetsk and Luhansk.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An examination by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> of the groups' websites, social media postings and other records found more than a dozen groups in Russia that are raising money for the separatists, aiding a conflict that has killed more than 6,400 people and plunged Russia's relations with the West to depths not seen since the Cold War.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The groups have relied on social media -- including <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and the Russian version of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> -- to direct donations through state-owned banks in Russia and through a private system of payment terminals owned by a company called QIWI that is affiliated with <span class="companylink">Visa</span> and traded on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span>. While most of the donations appear to come from Russia, the organizations have also solicited funds from abroad using large American and European financial institutions, including banks and companies like <span class="companylink">Western Union</span> and <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, even though many of the groups are targets of international sanctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund-raising could pose legal risks for those companies, which are prohibited from doing business with blacklisted people or groups. In fact, the sanctions have helped give rise to a cat-and-mouse game in which the fund-raising groups morph with the shifting circumstances, changing names and redirecting donations to new accounts to keep the money flowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> expected to renew its sanctions later this month, Mr. Putin has continued to insist that the fighters in eastern Ukraine are part of a homegrown opposition movement, even though a preponderance of evidence shows that Russia has provided manpower and weapons. In late May, for instance, two Russian soldiers were captured on the battlefield and charged with terrorism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Putin participated in the negotiations that produced a tenuous cease-fire in February, and he has called on both sides to reach a lasting political settlement, most recently during his meetings with Italian officials and Pope Francis in Rome. Officials in Ukraine and elsewhere, however, say that he has continued to stoke the conflict in order to keep his neighbor weak and unstable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent days, new signs of a buildup of Russian troops and equipment at the border, as well as fighting that killed at least 19 people on the outskirts of Donetsk, have raised fears that the simmering conflict will erupt again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Common Cause</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear just how extensive the fund-raising network is, or how much money flows through it, though the separatist groups identified by The Times claim in social media posts to have raised millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The network features a disparate yet overlapping cast of characters that includes a mustachioed former Russian military intelligence officer credited with starting the uprising, Igor Girkin, who uses the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov; the dissident writer and Putin critic Eduard Limonov, whose neo-nationalist followers have championed the territorial expansion in ethnically Russian regions with far more vigor than Mr. Putin's Kremlin; and a former ''foreign minister'' of the Donetsk People's Republic, Yekaterina Gubareva, and her husband, Pavel, an ethnic Russian from Ukraine and one of the most prominent separatist leaders there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All share a <span class="companylink">common cause</span>: establishment of a region loyal to Russia that is sometimes called the Donbass or Novorossiya. They make similar appeals to ethnic and political solidarity with the fighters opposing the central government in Kiev, and they share methods for raising money for illicit activities that the Internet has made vastly more efficient, according to experts and officials monitoring financial flows of criminal and terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Violent groups operating in war zones and their supporters abroad are exploiting advancements in communications and financial services technologies to more efficiently increase popular support and raise funds for their cause,'' said Howard Mendelsohn, a former deputy assistant Treasury secretary and now the managing director of Camstoll Group, an advisory firm in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to their own online appeals, the organizations have directed that donations be made via state-owned or state-controlled banks in Russia, including the country's largest, <span class="companylink">Sberbank</span>, or credit cards issued by those banks, some branded with <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> and <span class="companylink">Visa</span> logos. Mr. Putin's government, which strictly regulates nongovernmental organizations to monitor opposition political activity, has done little to stop the fund-raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of Russia's <span class="companylink">Federal Service for Financial Monitoring</span>, Yuri A. Chikhanchin, for instance, recently told Mr. Putin that his agency had frozen 3,500 bank accounts suspected of supporting terrorist organizations. The fighters in eastern Ukraine, however, are not among the groups Russia has designated as unlawful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anyone in Russia who wants to provide assistance to the D.P.R. and the L.P.R. is encouraged by and gets support from the Russian government,'' said John E. Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine now at <span class="companylink">the Atlantic Council</span> in Washington, using the abbreviations for the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the Money</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the fund-raising groups, Save the Donbass, claimed in May to have raised the equivalent of $1.3 million in donations through <span class="companylink">Sberbank</span> and other payment systems, including QIWI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund run by Ms. Gubareva and her husband, the Humanitarian Battalion of Novorossiya, claims to have raised $213,000 since its founding in May 2014, shortly after the fighting began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its website allows donors to direct their contributions to specific militia units, including a mortar battery named after the Russian version of Pinocchio, a puppet called Buratino, and boasts that it has provided not only the binoculars used in the destruction of the armored vehicle, but also tactical military gloves, laser range finders, radios and a car used by the battery's spotters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least five of the organizations solicit donations through <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, the online payment company based in California that is now owned by <span class="companylink">eBay</span>. <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> has in the past faced legal trouble for processing payments to entities in Iran, Sudan and Cuba, recently paying nearly $7.7 million in penalties in a settlement with the Treasury Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the Ukrainian-related accounts -- identified by email addresses in Russia -- a <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> spokeswoman, Sarah Frueh, said none of the accounts were valid. She declined to respond to additional questions seeking clarification. Many of the organizations openly advertise ways to donate using American and European banks. On the Humanitarian Battalion website, for instance, Ms. Gubareva explains how to wire dollars or euros into her account at <span class="companylink">Sberbank</span> using correspondent accounts at <span class="companylink">Citibank</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> in New York, among others. So did the separatist group Veche.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains unclear how much money is flowing into eastern Ukraine from abroad. Only one of the international banks said it had detected illicit donations, blocking a contribution to Ms. Gubareva's organization, according to a bank official who spoke on the condition that the bank not be identified. Another donation of $200 did pass to Veche, which is not on any blacklist but proclaims links to organizations that are -- including Mr. Strelkov's Novorossiya Movement and the Ghost Battalion, led by Aleksei Mozgovy until he died in an ambush last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the widespread use of QIWI has created potential risks for its partner, <span class="companylink">Visa</span>. Nearly all the fund-raising groups solicit donations through QIWI, a virtual payment company founded in 2004 and later incorporated, like many Russian companies, in Cyprus. QIWI provides consumers in Russia -- and increasingly other countries -- with a variety of ways to make payments online or through a network of tens of thousands of terminals that act like reverse A.T.M.s, allowing users to deposit cash and then pay participating vendors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Users can also move money to individuals -- or charitable organizations -- as long as they have accounts linked to working telephone numbers. Its partnership with <span class="companylink">Visa</span>, begun in 2012, allows customers to use a QIWI-Visa credit card to pay vendors outside QIWI's network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system has become wildly popular, used by 17 million Russians, but it has also skirted legal trouble. The company's terminals and credit cards -- along with the failure to require identification for transactions, as demanded by Russian law since last year -- can be easily exploited to transfer proceeds from illicit activities, from drug dealing to tax evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent filing with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, required because its stock is traded on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span>, QIWI said its system ''remains susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses'' such as money laundering by organized crime groups and other illicit actors, including those named in sanctions by the West for their activities in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the company filed an amendment, saying that law enforcement officials had carried out an investigation at its Moscow offices involving ''a small number of clients,'' though it did not elaborate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials with <span class="companylink">Visa</span> said they did not believe their company had processed any donations to the organizations examined. QIWI's chief executive, Sergei Solonin, said in a telephone interview that QIWI blocked some of the accounts identified by The Times last summer because they were engaged in fund-raising activity prohibited by company policy. The company, for instance, blocks the use of its system for political fund-raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solonin said other accounts were blocked after The Times brought them to QIWI's attention. One group, Tricolor, posted photographs of donations made on QIWI accounts as late as October 2014, but Mr. Solonin would not say whether that was one of the accounts closed later, citing Russia's financial confidentiality laws. After that interview, a number of groups noted on their websites that their QIWI accounts had been blocked, and removed them as payment options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But underscoring just how tricky it can be to curtail the groups' fund-raising activities, a number redirected money to new accounts. On April 20, a group called Batman noted on its social media page that all but its <span class="companylink">Sberbank</span> account had been blocked. But by May 18, it had updated the page to include a new QIWI account number and a plea: ''Donbass needs your help!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Western sanctions lists, for their part, have not kept up with the groups' ever-changing names. Mr. Strelkov's Novorossiya Movement, for instance, stopped soliciting funds after the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> placed sanctions on it in February. Instead, it asked that the funds be sent to a related group, not blacklisted, called Global Initiatives, run by the movement's chief of staff with Mr. Strelkov as chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early May, it morphed yet again, redirecting funds to yet another related group, ANO KNB. Later in the month, a group identified by the Novorossiya Movement as its partner, Strelkov Info, wrote that because of constant blocking of its accounts, ''we've decided to not post them in places open to all''; donors could send an email ''to find out transfer details.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new fund-raising appeals keep popping up. A group calling itself Dobrovolec.org was soliciting funds online as of May 26, with QIWI and <span class="companylink">Sberbank</span> accounts among the payment options. The group, which claims to be conducting at least two campaigns involving volunteer snipers and ''tankmen,'' called on fighters familiar with such deadly weaponry as surface-to-air missiles, flamethrowers and anti-tank guided missiles to join its effort to ''participate in military conflict in the west of former Ukraine on Novorossiya side.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing companies seeking to raise up to $50 million have a new financing option, starting Friday: a process that will open some private businesses to a wide pool of new investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three years in the making, the regulatory change, an expanded version of a rule known as Regulation A, is intended to let promising companies -- the kinds typically backed by venture capitalists and wealthy angel investors -- raise money by selling equity stakes to people of more modest means.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses will be able to advertise their offerings -- described as ''mini I.P.O.s'' by many in the industry -- on websites and through social media, giving fans and customers an opportunity to buy shares in companies that are not yet, and may never be, publicly traded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules are complex and controversial. Advocates see the change as an egalitarian move that will let people invest in brands they love and take a shot at finding new companies like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, whose earliest investors made far more than those who bought shares after it went public. Critics, however, say that complying with the rules of the new fund-raising process is so costly and complicated that few high-quality companies will bother to use it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has certainly been the case for the system the new rule is replacing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any company that wishes to sell securities to investors must either register with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> and file regular financial reports or find a legal exemption. The most commonly used one, called Regulation D, allows companies to sell shares mainly to accredited investors with an annual income of more than $200,000 or a net worth of at least $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law assumes that accredited investors are wealthy enough to take significant investment risks. But when it comes to average investors, regulators want more safeguards in place. An earlier version of the Regulation A rule allowed companies to raise up to $5 million from nonaccredited investors -- but it required those companies to first file an extensive, financially detailed offering document, subject to review by the S.E.C. and regulators in every state in which securities would be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 22,000 companies used Regulation D last year to raise money from investors. Only seven jumped through all the hoops to use Regulation A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been practicing for 22 years, and I've never done a Regulation A deal because of all the cost, complexity and brain damage that goes along with it,'' said Roger Hauptman, a Denver lawyer who specializes in corporate financing. ''I think 99 percent of lawyers would say that you should avoid taking money from unaccredited investors at all costs, unless it's absolutely necessary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some entrepreneurs say they do consider it necessary, for either financial or philosophical reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have companies that are eager to do this because they have passionate customers they want to invite in on the deal,'' said Ryan Feit, the chief executive of SeedInvest, an investment platform that had previously been open to only accredited investors. Mr. Feit is working with several companies, including Virtuix, a virtual reality hardware maker, and DietBet, a weight-loss business, that are considering using the new rules to raise money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Regulation A rule has a number of revisions intended to fix some of the earlier version's drawbacks, but the most significant change lifts the cap on how much money companies can raise, to $50 million from $5 million. (Companies that raise more than $20 million face more stringent reporting requirements than those seeking smaller amounts.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That higher cap is attracting entrepreneurs who say they are eager to test-drive the new rules. Kevin Harrington, the founder of a mobile-focused shopping site called StarShop, plans to file paperwork on Friday for an offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harrington is a serial entrepreneur who made a fortune as an infomercial pioneer and gained fame by appearing as an investor in the first two seasons of ''Shark Tank,'' in which entrepreneurs compete for financial backing. StarShop, based in New York, opened for business just weeks ago, but he is already envisioning its long-term future: ''This is a business that will require tens of millions of dollars in funding if we're going to build a billion-dollar company,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He could try to raise that money the traditional way, from venture capitalists and large investors -- <span class="companylink">Sprint</span> already owns a minority stake in the business -- but Mr. Harrington is a populist who likes the idea of having a broad network of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I did segments on 'Shark Tank,' I would get texts from people saying, 'Why didn't you invest in that company!? You should have done that deal!''' he said. ''Everybody wants to be a shark. If we have a huge base of small owners, they become very vocal about their involvement in StarShop, and they can spread the word.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulation A deals will not be fast, or cheap. Kendall Almerico, the lawyer preparing StarShop's paperwork, says a typical company will need to spend $50,000 to $100,000 on legal, accounting and filing fees. Every offering must be reviewed by and gain approval from the S.E.C., a process that takes more than 300 days, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those hurdles could discourage the most attractive investment candidates, the kinds of high-growth companies that rich individuals and venture capitalists compete with one another to fund. Rory Eakin, a co-founder of CircleUp, which connects consumer brands seeking financing with potential investors, says none of the entrepreneurs he works with want to deal with the headaches and restrictions. He worries about adverse selection, with Regulation A becoming a fallback used only by companies passed over by experienced investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some entrepreneurs say average investors are a better fit for their business than big financiers seeking outsize returns. Phil Paisley is the president of Interbill, a 43-year-old company in Rohnert Park, Calif., that makes billing software for lawyers. The company -- ''a small business hoping to be large,'' in Mr. Paisley's words -- has sales of $1.5 million a year and is operationally profitable, he says. He would like to expand nationwide and is preparing a Regulation A offering to raise up to $15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living on the outskirts of the Bay Area, Mr. Paisley is surrounded by venture firms and private investors, but they are not interested in slow-growth, midtier businesses like his.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They want Googles and Groupons,'' he said. ''Some of these angel investors have been very spoiled in being able to invest in something that can go from zero to $1 billion in just a few years. That's not this business. Our average client is with us for 17 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paisley plans to market his offering with a direct-mail campaign to thousands of lawyers and paralegals, the kinds of potential investors he thinks will understand his business and its prospects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor appointed Ms. Torres-Springer, who had been running the city's Small Business Services agency, to succeed Kyle Kimball as president of the Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Kimball resigned in March and joined the utility <span class="companylink">Consolidated Edison</span> last week.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Torres-Springer, 38, is the first woman to run the agency, which manages the city's assets and negotiates with companies seeking subsidies and other breaks from the city. During the administration of Mr. de Blasio's predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, she was the chief of staff to the president of the development corporation, Seth W. Pinsky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone interview, Ms. Torres-Springer said she would carry with her from her latest job the mission of creating better career opportunities for New Yorkers. She used the terms ''inclusive growth'' and ''inclusive innovation'' repeatedly in describing how she would run the development corporation to help ''a wide swath of New Yorkers'' as well as companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to not think about these as choices that have to be made,'' Ms. Torres-Springer said. The challenge, she said, will be to find ''a way to move forward where growth and inclusion are two sides of the same coin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an example, she cited the Tech Talent Pipeline, a program created by Small Business Services to train city residents for the jobs being created by the technology companies that are starting up and growing in New York. She also pointed to the improvements in the jobs that city residents have been finding through the work force development program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that 60 percent of the people placed through the program got full-time jobs, up from 30 percent. And the starting wages they received rose by more than 20 percent, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Rudin, an influential developer who is chairman of the <span class="companylink">Association for a Better New York</span>, praised the mayor's choice of Ms. Torres-Springer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She was right in the middle of all the things that the Bloomberg administration was doing in terms of economic development,'' Mr. Rudin said. ''She understands the appropriate balance of the different pulls and pushes that go on within the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Bird, who monitors the subsidies the city provides to corporations at Good Jobs New York, said it would be an ''exciting'' shift if the development corporation would be ''looking toward the qualitative aspects of job creation, rather than just the numbers.'' Ms. Bird added that ''at least rhetorically that seems like the right direction to be taking it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Torres-Springer, who has degrees from Yale and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, was born in California and grew up there and in the Philippines. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and two daughters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign, set up on the fund-raising website Indiegogo, had raised more than €487,000 by early Wednesday -- not an insignificant amount of money, but also not even 1 percent of the campaign's goal, with six days to go.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign was started by an Indiegogo user named Thom Feeney, who identifies himself as a 29-year-old working in a shoe shop in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's just get Greece sorted,'' Mr. Feeney wrote on the campaign page. ''All this dithering over Greece is getting boring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding, or raising money online from many individuals who each give small amounts, has financed a number of high-profile projects in recent years. Some campaigns seem to be intentionally wacky -- like the one in 2011 that raised $67,000 to pay for a RoboCop statue in Detroit -- while others seek to make the world a better place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a crowdfunding campaign to bail out a country seems to be a first, according to Anindya Ghose, a professor of information technology and marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business, who has been researching crowdfunding for the past six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very unique,'' Mr. Ghose wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In at least one way, though, the campaign and the reaction to the crisis in Greece fit into what Mr. Ghose has seen in his research: Altruism is a key motivating factor inspiring people to donate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to put a price on that kind of support,'' Mr. Ghose said. ''It's priceless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gifts of different sizes to the Indiegogo fund yield different rewards for the donor. A €10 donation gets a bottle of ouzo, while a donation of a million euros buys ''a lot of gratitude from the citizens of Europe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters are using the hashtag #crowdfundgreece to spread the word on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One poster, @edrex, said: ''Crowdfund the Greek bailout. If it fails, you get your money back. If it works, you're a part of history. No-brainer''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some pondered whether the campaign would raise the €1.5 billion. ''Every time I refresh the page, the numbers are up. Is this going to work?'' @LisaFreiburg posted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expert opinion: Absolutely not. And even if it did, the €1.5 billion that was due Tuesday is a tiny fraction of Greece's total debt, which Reuters estimated at €242.8 billion. Another payment, €3.5 billion to the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>, is due in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately, it does not have much teeth,'' Mr. Ghose said. ''Even if it goes viral, there is just no way this campaign can lead to a meaningful amount that will truly bail out the government.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No harm in trying, though.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after presenting her start-up to potential investors at a conference, Nancy Hua was bombarded by eager suitors. A little more than 48 hours later, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur had amassed about $2 million from wealthy individuals known as angel investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of angels that Ms. Hua raised money from: 21. And she could have gotten more if she had not cut them off.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thirty seconds into my pitch, three people emailed me saying they wanted to invest in my company,'' Ms. Hua, 29, said of the experience raising money for her start-up, Apptimize, for which she announced the funding last year. ''We had dozens of people whose money we turned down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For entrepreneurs, nabbing numerous angels -- and prominent ones to boot -- has become a kind of trophy collecting, a chase that comes with some risk for their companies. And for many relatively new investors, a winning bet on a hot start-up can pay off richly in Silicon Valley cultural capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, over 2,960 angels participated in a financing round, more than triple the 822 angels who did so in 2010, according to CB Insights, a research firm that studies venture capital. There is even a moniker for financing rounds that have many angels with no lead investor: ''party rounds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Seed investing is the status symbol of Silicon Valley,'' said Sam Altman, president of YCombinator, the start-up accelerator that has birthed companies such as <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and Reddit. ''Most people don't want Ferraris, they want a winning seed investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while young founders are taking advantage of what is probably one of the best times to be raising venture capital, there can be serious downsides. When many angels are involved, for example, no one investor may feel compelled to help the company if it runs into trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the same time, having a dozen or more on-the-ground investors can also mean a dozen or more opinions about company strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danielle Morrill, chief executive of Mattermark, discovered this firsthand. She founded the start-up, which tracks the growth of private companies, in 2013 and said she ended up with almost 160 investments from individuals, many of whom wrote roughly $50,000 checks. The investors often chime in about Mattermark's product direction, she said, and to be polite, she is encouraging to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You want to keep tapping into their collective intelligence so you keep saying 'Thank you for the feedback' and they keep sending it,'' Ms. Morrill said. ''But then you are sitting there alone at 3 a.m. and you have to decide on just one thing to focus your tiny team on and your mind races like you had too much to drink but you're totally sober.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cope with the deluge of advice, Ms. Morrill said she has had to start turning a deaf ear to many of the suggestions. ''I love those Beats commercials where the basketball player puts on his music and tunes it all out, to go win the game,'' she said. ''That's what it feels like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ballooning number of angels has been spurred by incredible wealth creation over the last five years in Silicon Valley. The initial public offerings of companies like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, Workday and LinkedIn created scores of tech millionaires, many flush with cash to spend on the next generation of new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Morin and Kevin Colleran, for example, two former <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees, are now active angel investors. Other prominent angels, like Max Levchin and Marissa Mayer, banked tens of millions of dollars from their days at slightly older web companies like <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brand-name Silicon Valley start-ups such as <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>, Uber and Lyft have grabbed attention in recent months with their efforts to raise expansive multibillion-dollar funding rounds. Yet the technology start-up fervor begins at a far earlier stage -- when many of these companies are the sum total of just a few people and their MacBook Pros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frenzy has now reached the point where tiny start-ups have unprecedented ranks of angel investors. CodeFights, a coding start-up, and Amplitude, a data analytics company, said they secured about 30 angel investors each within the last year. Spring, a mobile shopping start-up, counted about 45 investors in its first round of funding in 2013, according to CB Insights. ZenPayroll, which calls itself a human relations software start-up, has 56 angels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Tigran Sloyan, co-founder and chief executive of CodeFights, was looking for funding this year, he wanted to get a well-known angel to commit. He approached Adam D'Angelo, an early <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employee and co-founder of the question-and-answer site <span class="companylink">Quora</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I pitched the idea to Adam, he was super on board,'' Mr. Sloyan said. By March, a month after Mr. D'Angelo agreed to invest, CodeFights had raised $2.5 million from more than 30 investors. ''After they see a name they trust, everybody wants to invest,'' Mr. Sloyan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email, Mr. D'Angelo, who began angel investing after cashing out of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, said that he was drawn to the experience of CodeFights' founders, the fact that consumers were already using the start-up's products and the company's potential market size if things go well. ''There is a lot of potential here,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's in contrast to the handful of angels -- usually five to 10 people -- that start-ups typically had in the past. ''The total angel scene back when I started in 2006 was 30 or 50 angels, maybe with three to five very active ones,'' said Aydin Senkut, founder and managing director of Felicis Ventures, a Silicon Valley firm that focuses on early stage investments. ''Now everybody and their family and their pets who have some money want to get into angel investing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing numbers of angels have spurred competition to get into deals, leading to some questionable practices. Spenser Skates, co-founder and chief executive of Amplitude, said some angels were so eager to put money into start-ups that they barely glanced at deal terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't do the same sort of diligence,'' Mr. Skates said. ''They hear your story and you send them the paperwork.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too many angels can also hurt a start-up and be taken as an indication that a company is not strong enough to attract any one ''lead'' investor, said Ms. Hua of Apptimize. Many angels may also not know the exact health of the start-up they have invested in when asked by others, which can give the perception that the company is not doing well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That communication overhead isn't something I'd realized would happen beforehand,'' Ms. Hua said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For would-be angels, help is on the way. Mr. Altman's YCombinator is educating new individual investors and held an event in March at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters that was essentially a crash course in angel investing. The four-hour, invitation-only event included tips on how to evaluate founders and their ideas and how angels can be helpful to companies they invest in. The event also stressed that angel investing was difficult to do well, and that newcomers should expect to lose money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YCombinator also warns young entrepreneurs about taking on too much, too fast. ''We tell them very explicitly, they should prefer a small number of investors,'' Mr. Altman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had the foresight to plan other options,'' Filip Jan Rymsza, the project's lead producer, said by telephone on Monday. ''We'd still love to finish it by the end of the year, but if we flip into 2016, so be it. We're not going to rush it.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Other Side of the Wind,'' started in the 1970s by Welles, who died in 1985, currently exists as 1,083 reels of footage stored in a warehouse outside Paris. The film, a skewering of avant-garde directors, finally appeared to be speeding toward a release after a production team announced in October that it had untangled and secured the rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the financing became complicated. Mr. Rymsza and his team had planned to raise the money for editing, music and other postproduction costs by preselling distribution rights, a common tactic in the independent film business. But potential distributors wanted to see an edited sequence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the producers decided in May to raise postproduction funds by going to the public, unveiling a campaign to raise as much as $2 million on Indiegogo by June 14. They ultimately reduced the goal to $1 million and extended the deadline to July 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, ''The Other Side of the Wind'' raised $406,405 from 2,858 people, including a last-minute $50,000 from Dean DeBlois, director of the DreamWorks Animation movie ''How to Train Your Dragon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: Unlike some other crowdsourcing platforms, which use an all-or-nothing approach to meeting goals, Indiegogo gives participants who have come up short the option of keeping what they raised. ''We're enormously grateful for the contributors, because we now have enough to at least start the next phase,'' Mr. Rymsza said. ''From that standpoint, we feel the Indiegogo campaign was a big success.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a sizzling June morning in Las Vegas, 10 <span class="companylink">Zappos.com</span> employees sat in an air-conditioned conference room decorated with ''Star Wars'' memorabilia and a mural of Darth Vader. They had gathered for a weekly meeting to discuss new internal software, the sort of routine get-together that keeps corporate America humming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like all meetings these days at Zappos, the online merchant best known for its shoes, this one followed a strict format determined by a radical self-management system called Holacracy. The goal of Holacracy is to create a dynamic workplace where everyone has a voice and bureaucracy doesn't stifle innovation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Zappos, this means traditional corporate hierarchy is gone. Managers no longer exist. The company's 1,500 employees define their own jobs. Anyone can set the agenda for a meeting. To prevent anarchy, processes are strictly enforced. At the June meeting, a trained facilitator, in this case a young bearded man wearing a blue baseball hat, followed the Holacratic method by asking attendees to ''get here, get present, get now,'' and encouraged everyone in the room to briefly check in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a little sleepy,'' said a wiry man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's warm out,'' was the next reply. ''I'm also sleepy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm doing a Zumbathon for three hours this afternoon,'' one woman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My hands smell like oranges, so I'm a little distracted by that,'' said Danielle Kelly, a former call center worker who is helping bring self-management to Zappos. ''Also, I'm in this room for five straight hours of meetings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up was Tony Hsieh, 41, who has run Zappos for 16 years and is the person who insisted that the company adopt Holacracy. ''I feel Danielle is being overdramatic,'' he deadpanned. ''But I prefer her being overdramatic to passive-aggressive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hsieh (pronounced Shay) is a minor celebrity in the technology industry. A son of Taiwanese immigrants and a graduate of <span class="companylink">Harvard</span>, he sold his first company, LinkExchange, to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> for $265 million. He then invested in Zappos, became its chief executive and sold it to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Hsieh has managed to preserve Zappos's reputation as a fun place to work. The youthful work force is heavily tattooed; the dress code is aggressively casual. Desks are cluttered with giant stuffed animals, and sound-emitting sculptures designed by the Blue Man Group line the walls. ''Create fun and a little weirdness'' is written in the Zappos corporate charter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Zappos grew, innovation slowed. The staff expanded, more managers joined the ranks, and the freewheeling culture lost momentum. ''We had gone from being a fast speedboat to a cruise ship,'' one longtime employee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boss felt it too. ''A lot of people in the organization, including myself, felt like there were more and more layers of bureaucracy,'' Mr. Hsieh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hsieh knew his company needed a fix. But at Zappos, conventional team-building exercises would not suffice. He needed to get weird. After learning about Holacracy in 2012, he decided it was just the thing for Zappos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Hsieh embarked on another lofty project: an attempt to revitalize downtown Las Vegas, a dilapidated area miles from the Strip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has invested $350 million of his money in real estate, redevelopment, small businesses and venture capital funds. A former casino became a hangout for Zappos employees, stocked with board games instead of slot machines. A vacant lot is now a trailer park crammed with shiny silver Airstreams that are rented out to visiting computer coders. He moved into one trailer a few months ago and keeps a pet alpaca there. He calls the community Llamalopolis. It is the anti-Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either one of these undertakings could be a full-time job for an idealistic multimillionaire. But Mr. Hsieh has fully immersed himself in both the transformation of his company and adopted city. ''A lot of companies talk about work-life balance,'' Mr. Hsieh said. ''We're more about work-life integration. At the end of the day, it's life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Mr. Hsieh has one other job as well: quelling the doubters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither of his paradigm-changing projects has proceeded smoothly. Two years into Holacracy, Zappos is no workplace utopia. Downtown Las Vegas has some new shops and restaurants, but problems like homelessness and unemployment persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hsieh has already proved he can build and run successful companies. He translated that experience into a second career as a business visionary, the author of the book ''Delivering Happiness'' and a motivational speaker. But now, while betting his fortune and reputation on his most ambitious visions to date, Mr. Hsieh's hot hand appears to be at risk of going cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, Mr. Hsieh traveled to Austin, Tex., to give the keynote speech at the Conscious Capitalism C.E.O. Summit, a gathering of progressive executives. There, he heard a presentation that was strange enough to get his attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the stage was Brian Robertson, who invented Holacracy at his start-up, Ternary Software. Mr. Robertson, a computer programmer with no training in human resources, let alone occupational psychology, seems an unlikely candidate to lead a workplace revolution. At Ternary, Mr. Robertson innovated his practices on the fly, testing his approach to self-management . The end result was what he refers to as an ''operating system'' for organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After peppering Mr. Robertson with questions, Mr. Hsieh was convinced. Zappos would go Holacratic. The transformation began in 2013 in certain departments, but only in recent months has the entire company taken the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing about Holacracy is easy to understand. In place of a traditional organizational chart are concentric circles of responsibility. Employees get to choose which circles they belong to and what projects they work on. The jargon is relentless. At meetings, ''tensions'' are resolved. People don't have one job; they have multiple ''roles.'' ''Lead links'' are designated to communicate between circles. Everyone must use the Holacracy software, called Glass Frog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such self-management remains the exception in the workplace today, yet its advocates constitute a small but growing movement. Holacracy has other adherents, including the David Allen Company, a consultancy, and Medium, the blogging platform started by the Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, though none of the other users are as large as Zappos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel like I'm in control without being controlling all the time,'' said Ruben Timmerman, who adopted Holacracy at Springest, a 25-person online education company he founded in Amsterdam. ''The team is more efficient and more creative because of the sharing, and also more accountable. It has definitely helped us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Zappos, Mr. Hsieh seems to regard Holacracy as a way to revive the close-knit community feeling that made the company so special 10 years ago, when it was just a few hundred people taking on the giants of e-commerce. ''Once you have that level of friendship, there's higher levels of trust,'' he said. ''Communication is better; you can send emails without fear of being misinterpreted; people do favors for one another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only it were so simple. Holacracy has been met with everything from cautious embrace to outright revulsion at Zappos, but little unequivocal enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no putting rose-colored glasses on it,'' said John Bunch, who is leading the Holacracy push throughout Zappos. ''We're just taking baby steps.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is really painful and slow at first,'' said Christa Foley, a 10-year Zappos veteran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Josh Pedro, who is in charge of managing Zappos's public relations, doesn't sugarcoat the situation. ''It was a weird transition,'' he confessed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kelly, the former call center worker, applauded Holacracy for giving even the lowest-paid workers a voice. ''A person who just takes phone calls can propose something for the entire company,'' she said. ''It's empowering everybody to have the same voice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said that the procedural formality of Holacracy, the ever-expanding number of circles and the endless meetings were a drain on productivity. ''It's taking time away from getting the actual work done,'' she said. This was the same day as the software meeting, and as if still in disbelief, she said once again, ''I have five hours of meetings today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Zappos is pushing ahead with Holacracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the day, Mr. Hsieh was back in the ''Star Wars'' conference room with a different group of employees. For the animating force behind a billion-dollar company, Mr. Hsieh is disarmingly understated. He wears a uniform of a black Zappos T-shirts and jeans, and speaks to colleagues in a soft monotone. He works for just $36,000 a year, forgoing a big salary or stock options in exchange for the autonomy to run Zappos however he sees fit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting's agenda centered on compensation. As Zappos went Holacratic, employees were initially encouraged to keep doing their existing jobs, or roles, and assigned to circles with their colleagues. Salaries would remain the same for the time being, too. But two years in, employees are leaving their original circles and taking on new roles. Priorities are shifting, and no one, not even Mr. Hsieh, is sure how to pay people at a company with no job titles and fluid roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the meeting, Mr. Hsieh wanted someone to investigate a new system that would allow everyone at the company to see how many hours any employee had worked on a particular task, in keeping with the Holacracy vision of radical transparency. No one volunteered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not getting anywhere,'' he said. ''There's no easy short- or medium-term answer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Mr. Hsieh asked Mr. Bunch if he would look into it. Mr. Bunch demurred, saying he had too much to do. Mr. Hsieh pushed again, and Mr. Bunch relented. Zappos may not have a hierarchy, but it was clear who was in charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, Mr. Hsieh moved Zappos from a comfortable campus in the suburbs to the former Las Vegas city hall, in the center of the downtown mix of dive bars, weekly motels and vacant lots. This decision did not deliver happiness to all his employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Hsieh had a vision. In the same way that Holacracy might get Zappos employees collaborating again, injecting bodies and businesses might revitalize a blighted neighborhood. Mr. Hsieh also had $350 million of his own money to spend on the idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While moving the company, Mr. Hsieh also founded the Downtown Project, allocating $200 million to buy about 60 acres of real estate. The remaining money was split into thirds, $50 million each for small-business investments, venture capital stakes in technology companies and support for education and the arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2013, new life was coursing through downtown. A few upscale restaurants sprang up. Then came a complex constructed out of shipping containers that is home to a salon, a bar, a toy store and a candy shop. Now there is an independent bookstore, a gourmet doughnut shop, a vegan restaurant, a sushi bar and a yoga studio. Foot traffic is up, and crime is down. Last year, Mr. Hsieh gave up his sprawling condominium on the 23rd floor of a luxury apartment building and moved into the trailer park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Guadagnoli, a kinesiology professor of the <span class="companylink">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</span>, who also specializes in optimizing performance and communication in the workplace, has lived in the city for 20 years. ''When I moved here, I would go downtown and be uncomfortable. Then it got worse and worse,'' he said. ''Now it's a really fun place to go. It's a destination. Anyone who says the Downtown Project has not made a significant and lasting impact on Las Vegas is crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, change in downtown Las Vegas is slow going. Homelessness remains endemic. Quality housing is in short supply. As a result, many Zappos employees are still living in the suburbs and commuting to work. Building street life in a city where the temperature routinely hits 100 degrees has its challenges. Shops and restaurants catering to a new creative class have opened, but few are brimming with business. Many are hemorrhaging money. Some, including a co-working space and a flower shop, have closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the start-ups funded by Mr. Hsieh -- who personally lured many entrepreneurs to Las Vegas with pitches about starting a Silicon Valley in the desert -- a few seem to be doing well, but several have shut down. And in a devastating blow to the community, three entrepreneurs funded by the Downtown Project committed suicide from January 2013 to May 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, the Downtown Project fired 30 of 100 support staff employees, and Mr. Hsieh reportedly stepped away from his leadership role. That prompted David Gould, a liberal arts professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Iowa</span> whom Mr. Hsieh had persuaded to move to Las Vegas for the Downtown Project, to write an open letter accusing his patron of incompetence and mismanagement. ''We have not experienced a string of tough breaks or bad luck,'' Mr. Gould wrote, just before he quit and moved back to Iowa. ''Rather, this is a collage of decadence, greed and missing leadership.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late May, Mr. Hsieh took the stage at a Zappos all-hands meeting at a theater in downtown Las Vegas. These are usually jovial affairs featuring circus performers and the like, but this gathering was more reflective. By some measures, Zappos was thriving, Mr. Hsieh said, sharing business updates from the quarter. But he also acknowledged that the transition to Holacracy had not been going smoothly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six weeks earlier, Mr. Hsieh sent a 4,700-word email to the entire company with an ultimatum: Embrace Holacracy or accept a buyout. The financial terms were generous, and 210 employees, or some 14 percent of the work force, took the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After many employees left, Mr. Hsieh acknowledged that some of the remaining staff members wanted him to resign from the company he built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brewing employee discontent reflects the paradox at the heart of any company's move to Holacracy. For all of the talk of self-management and consensus building, the decision to go down this path was Mr. Hsieh's alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Robertson, the Holacracy creator, frames this choice as the pinnacle of great management. ''By heroically releasing authority into the system's embrace, the leader paves the way for an authentic distribution of power through every level of the organization,'' he writes in his book, ''Holacracy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at Zappos, it seems that many wish Mr. Hsieh had never made the choice. Some people want a boss after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed for instances of Holacracy's achievements at Zappos, employees could offer only pedestrian examples. Mr. Hsieh had shut the bridge connecting the office to a parking garage, hoping staff would experience more serendipitous encounters if they all used the same entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that meant employees had to venture onto the seedy streets to get to and from their cars, leaving some, especially those working late shifts, feeling unsafe. So one employee proposed that the bridge be reopened, a motion that was accepted by the circle that controlled campus operations, essentially overriding the C.E.O.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or as a Zappos spokesman described the process, using Holacratic terms: ''An employee (unknown) brought it to the road block role with safety being the tension. The road block role then took it to the grease and disrupt circle where it went through the process and was eventually passed with no objections.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another case, a shuttle bus driver was able to add an agenda item to a meeting, requesting that employees not leave trash on the bus. So far, however, no one could point to any innovations that have improved customer service or increased sales. Critical issues like how to hire, fire and pay people in a company with no job titles have emerged as sticking points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hsieh and his acolytes remain adamant that self-management will unlock the potential of Zappos employees, allowing them to be productive and creative. ''We believe that, over time, the ability for people to be empowered and entrepreneurial will make people happy,'' Mr. Bunch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tinge of defensiveness in Mr. Bunch's answers was understandable after a wave of negative press coverage, with headlines like ''Holacracy or Hella Crazy?'' ''Banishing the Bosses Brings Confusion,'' and ''A Holacracy of Dunces.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And even Mr. Robertson concedes that his operating system for the organization is not easy, at least not at first. ''All the negatives? Those are all true,'' he said. ''It can be a long moment of pain and agony.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he emphasized that learning Holacracy was like learning a sport -- it would take years to get good at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hsieh expressed impatience with questions about Holacracy's rocky start at Zappos, repeating Mr. Robertson's mantra that the transition would take time. ''Imagine 10 or 20 aboriginals and you gave them a football rule book,'' he said. ''It's going to take them a while to understand the game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long day of Holacracy meetings, Mr. Hsieh was relaxing in a temporary aboveground swimming pool at Llamalopolis, not far from a chicken coop. The alpaca, named Marley, lingered nearby. (Mr. Hsieh has an affinity for llamas but says alpacas are friendlier.) With the sun still hanging above the palm trees, the temperature hadn't budged, but the heat and daylight didn't dissuade Mr. Hsieh from getting the party started. Out came a bottle of Fernet-Branca, a bitter herbal liqueur, and everyone present took shots out of tiny plastic cups. As he soaked, the Holacracy sales pitch continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main thing is that everyone's voice is heard,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that all voices in an organization are equally valuable is antithetical to the way most companies are run. Inexperienced employees, the conventional wisdom goes, should learn from managers who know what they're doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, Mr. Hsieh and other proponents of Holacracy argue that by marginalizing large swaths of the organization, important issues go unresolved and potential goes untapped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, he hopes that with a little economic stimulus, the people of Las Vegas can create vibrant civic life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Hsieh can't succeed alone, even with all his money. For Holacracy to work, he needs buy-in from the 1,500 Zappos employees who chose to stay. For downtown Las Vegas to thrive, he needs buy-in from the city, from real estate developers, from the neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are glimmers of hope. One Zappos team member said that after months of torturous meetings, her circle, which promotes Zappos culture, was running more efficiently. A couple of small businesses were opening up downtown without funding from Mr. Hsieh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just up the street from Llamalopolis was an abandoned motel. Mr. Hsieh had bought the property and was hoping that <span class="companylink">Virgin Hotels</span> or the Ace Hotel group would take it over. He bought another parcel a few blocks farther down the road, where he hoped to erect housing. Ideally, Zappos employees would move in, then spend their salaries -- whenever they figure out how to pay themselves -- at businesses backed by the Downtown Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hsieh is a high-stakes gambler, and shooting for the moon is what he does, said Mr. Guadagnoli, the <span class="companylink">University of Nevada, Las Vegas</span>, professor, who has worked with Mr. Hsieh over the years. ''These are pretty crazy experiments, but it's Tony,'' he said. ''Sometimes he says things that don't make any sense, but a few years later, they make sense. Maybe this is one of those.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses hoping to borrow money from banks ran into a major obstacle on Thursday, when the government agency that guarantees many of those loans was forced to freeze the program because it had reached its limit for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The freeze was put in place for the first time in a decade -- other than during government shutdowns -- when the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> hit its limit of $18.75 billion for 2015. More than 900 applicants were awaiting loan approvals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it is very likely that Congress will approve a higher cap, the fact that the agency's cap was reached so early in the year indicates how heavy the demand for small-business loans has become, despite relatively small, shaky signs of growth in the larger economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Creditworthy small businesses are coming back into the market,'' said Rohit Arora, the chief executive of Biz2Credit, a site that matches business borrowers with loans. ''They're feeling more confident, and they're borrowing for both working capital and for expansion. The approval rates right now are the highest we've seen this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extended shutdown in the S.B.A.'s loan program would be ''a complete disaster,'' said Lynn G. Ozer, the president of government-guaranteed lending at <span class="companylink">Susquehanna Bank</span> in Pottstown, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless Congress acts, the agency will be unable to process loans until its new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. But many in the industry say they anticipate a quicker resolution. Just hours after the S.B.A. suspended its program, the Senate unanimously passed an entrepreneurship bill with an amendment that would lift the S.B.A.'s cap to a record $23.5 billion and allow it to resume approving loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House plans to take up the bill on Monday. Officials from the S.B.A. and from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders</span>, an industry trade group, say they are confident that the measure has enough bipartisan support to pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. does not make direct loans through its largest lending program, known as 7(a) loans. Instead, it guarantees a portion of the loans made by third-party lenders like <span class="companylink">Susquehanna Bank</span>, repaying the lender if the borrower defaults. The goal is to make capital available for business owners that would not otherwise qualify. Because the program is fully financed by the fees borrowers and lenders pay, no taxpayer money is used to cover loan losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for S.B.A.-backed loans has been rising in recent years, and the agency has repeatedly come close to exhausting its lending authority. Last year, Congress acted in September to raise the lending cap just days before it would have been reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the S.B.A. saw signs as early as February that it was headed for a record year and would probably hit its cap before the year's end, according to Ben Chang, an agency spokesman. The agency began warning lenders earlier this month that the ceiling was in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That prompted a flood of applications. Loan applications this month totaled $3 billion, about five times the normal volume in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People hit the gas pedal,'' Ms. Ozer said. ''We all saw it coming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it normally takes a week or two for loan applications to be processed, lenders say borrowers will not be significantly affected if this freeze is short-lived. If the House follows the Senate and approves legislation early next week, lending could resume quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert F. Polito Jr., a senior vice president at Webster Bank in Waterbury, Conn., has two potential borrowers waiting in the S.B.A.'s approval queue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't even want to let them know, because I really don't think it will affect them,'' he said. ''Why give them agita?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Polito said the S.B.A.'s program filled a vital gap in the lending landscape, allowing banks like Webster to extend credit to businesses that would not otherwise meet their underwriting criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we use the government-guaranteed products, we're able to turn loans that would be a 'no' into a 'yes,''' he said. Those loans seem riskier, but the default rates are identical for Webster Bank's conventional business loans and those backed by the S.B.A., he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last several months, Lisa Chow, a reporter for and co-host of ''StartUp,'' a podcast about starting a business, has been interviewing engineers at <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Chow was not interviewing Ford employees for a news story. She was making an advertisement for Ford to run on her podcast, between news segments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of the interviews, Ms. Chow said, is to record ''a funny moment, a revealing moment or a humanizing moment'' -- like the one she had with Katie Allanson, a Ford engineer who helped make a weighted suit that simulates the experience of old age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interview, Ms. Allanson said about those who wore the suit: ''I had a couple people tell me, 'I've been really hard on my mom.' That one really resonated with me as well, because my parents are getting older too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Podcasts -- audio stories that can be saved and played on a computer or smartphone -- have reached new levels of popularity, as illustrated by the success last year of ''Serial,'' a story of a 16-year-old murder case that was downloaded over 80 million times. New podcasts are popping up seemingly every week, and larger media brands -- including <span class="companylink">BuzzFeed</span> and The New Republic -- are also trying out the format.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick in popularity has made podcasting a rare cause for optimism in serious journalism. Podcasting often offers an in-depth form of reporting that advertisers want to pay for and that is attracting talent largely from radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind much of podcasting's growth, though, is the embrace of ads in which hosts gush over products or even do reporting for advertising spots. That has led to a clash between those coming from public radio and those with a commercial radio background, with some expressing concern that journalists, who rely on trust, are using their position of confidence to push products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The line between advertising and news has never been quite as sharp on commercial radio as on public radio. Commercial D.J.s and hosts have endorsed advertisers' products since the medium's early days. But because of <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span> rules forbidding advertising on public radio, those journalists, who have flocked to podcasts, stayed out of the endorsement business -- until the advent of stand-alone podcasts, which are not regulated by the F.C.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm utterly sympathetic to podcast hosts and entrepreneurs trying to fund their work,'' said Jay Allison, producer of ''The Moth Radio Hour,'' a widely distributed radio show in which people tell true stories about themselves. ''I confess, though, to feeling uncomfortable hearing public radio people in the role of pitch person for product, since I'm counting on them for something else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called native advertising -- ads that echo the look or feel of journalism they accompany, like the one Ms. Chow helped create for Ford -- has quickly gained currency at online news outlets. But native ads have perhaps no more traction than in audio journalism. On dozens of podcasts, hosts and reporters are responsible for producing news stories as well as advertisements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We try to make ads as compelling for the listener as the rest of the show,'' said Matt Lieber, a co-founder of Gimlet Media, the company that produces ''StartUp.'' ''We go to Ford and say, 'What's the most interesting thing about Ford?' And that's what we talk about in the podcast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reliance on native ads has worked so far. For-profit podcast creators, which rely almost entirely on advertising for revenue, keep popping up, and Gimlet says it is breaking even. Networks like Gimlet; Panoply, from the online magazine Slate; and Midroll Media all started within the last three years. Last week, E. W. Scripps bought Midroll for a price the companies would not disclose. <span class="companylink">National Public Radio</span> says its revenue from podcasting has tripled since 2013. Public Radio Exchange, another nonprofit podcast distributor, projects that sponsorship revenue -- the majority of which comes from podcasts -- grew ninefold from 2013 to 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ads, hosts often discuss their own experiences using a product. In ''Theory of Everything,'' a general-interest program on Public Radio Exchange, Benjamen Walker has talked about the virtues of mattresses made by Casper and of an online history class he took on the Great Courses -- products he came to like after advertisers gave them to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advertisers are naturally attracted to being associated with well-liked hosts. ''When the host is personally reading the ad and telling a story about the product in her own words, it lands with the audience in a different and more authentic way than a traditional ad spot,'' said Mark DiCristina, marketing director at MailChimp, an email marketing company that is one of the most prolific podcast advertisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walker and other podcasters say they draw inspiration from a tradition outside journalism: commercial radio hosts who are paid to endorse products on the air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That form of advertising is as old as radio itself,'' said Andy Bowers, the chief content officer at Panoply. ''I used to love old reruns of Jack Benny as a kid. His show was brought to you by Jell-O.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference here, some in the radio world say, is not so much what the ads sound like, but who is delivering them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For serious journalists to be reading ads is a little problematic, I think, because the old firewall between editorial and journalism is completely broken down,'' said Curtis Fox, an independent radio producer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been opposition internally, with some podcast hosts resisting native ads. P. J. Vogt and Alex Goldman, the hosts of ''Reply All,'' a technology program from Gimlet, recently asked if they could stop explicitly endorsing products such as <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> Outlook. They said they would rather just talk about the experience of using them. Their bosses obliged, and now the hosts instead discuss their personal experiences with products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those critics -- and some podcast hosts -- worry about a slippery slope. The F.C.C. has no oversight over podcasts. The <span class="companylink">Federal Trade Commission</span>, which regulates advertising, has warned publishers to clearly label native ads but has not issued any guidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That freedom has given organizations such as <span class="companylink">National Public Radio</span> the chance to experiment with other ways of identifying their supporters as well as the responsibility of creating guidelines for themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You won't hear overt promotion, such as endorsements, testimonials, specific product prices or calls to purchase,'' Isabel Lara, an N.P.R. spokeswoman, said of the network's podcasts. ''But you may hear how you can engage the sponsor or its products or services a little more directly than what the F.C.C. would allow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some podcast networks, including at Gimlet and Midroll, the hosts are given veto power over who advertises on their shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It isn't a daily occurrence, but there isn't a week that goes by where we haven't had to turn down an advertiser,'' said Lex Friedman, who runs ad sales at Midroll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many podcasters say they also try to be clear with listeners about what is an ad and what is journalism, separating them with music and disclaimers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the distinction hasn't always been clear to others recruited to help make the ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, a Gimlet employee emailed Linda Sharps, a parenting blogger from Eugene, Ore., to ask if a producer could interview her 9-year-old son about a website he had built with the online publishing platform Squarespace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sharps eagerly said yes. Only when the interview aired did she learn it was for a Squarespace ad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling duped, she began posting on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> about the show's advertising policies. Alex Blumberg, a co-founder of Gimlet and the host of ''StartUp,'' called Ms. Sharps and apologized, saying that it had been an error. Gimlet eventually aired an episode of ''StartUp'' about the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sharps later said she forgave Gimlet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My son was a little bummed at the time,'' Ms. Sharps said recently in an email. ''I think his reaction was something like, 'I'm in an ad? But I hate ads! I skip them on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> all the time.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, grew animated as he addressed a late spring conference of executives from minority-owned businesses. Voicing exasperation with what he called the homogeneous hue of the financial sector, Mr. Stringer demanded that investment funds hire more women and nonwhite employees, starting with the city's youths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you really want to do is take our kids, start them at the bottom -- and now we're here,'' Mr. Stringer said, pausing to allow the musical allusion to sink in for those familiar with it.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's what the Drake song says,'' Mr. Stringer continued. ''Start them at the bottom, and now we're here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer, 55, does not look like a politician who would invoke hip-hop lyrics in a discourse on economic opportunity. A former Manhattan borough president, Mr. Stringer jokingly refers to his own status as a bespectacled white guy, and laments that too many big companies are run by people ''who look like me.'' (He sometimes adds: ''With better suits.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet since winning election to his job in 2013, after defeating former Gov. Eliot Spitzer in a Democratic primary, Mr. Stringer has sought to build a broader reputation for himself. After relying heavily on his Manhattan base to defeat Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Stringer has wooed community leaders with determined intensity, visiting churches and business associations to advertise the inventive ways he has wielded his powers as comptroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer has pursued that campaign, as a self-described social justice advocate, within the confines of a staid role: serving as the city's accountant and the steward of its nearly $160 billion pension fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has drawn the widest notice, so far, for a series of financial settlements, totaling almost $38 million, with people wrongfully convicted of crimes and the families of victims of abuse in the criminal justice system. This month, Mr. Stringer announced a $5.9 million agreement with the family of Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died after being placed in a police chokehold last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the comptroller has also attacked New York's low rate of contracting with female- and minority-owned businesses, and has talked in forceful terms about using the city's pension fund as a bludgeon to open up insular investment firms. If companies do not look ''like the city we serve,'' Mr. Stringer told the group Asian Women in Business last month, ''we just might not do business with them anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer has laid out a fiscal argument for his activities. Explaining why he had begun demanding diversity statistics from city investment funds, Mr. Stringer told one audience, ''Diverse groups make fiscal decisions that are sound.'' The settlement with Mr. Garner's family, he said, reflected his desire to balance ''the fiscal exposure of the city with the hope you can bring some relief'' to family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe we have broken ground in this area,'' Mr. Stringer said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Stringer has stated a fiduciary rationale for his agenda, the political logic is perhaps even clearer. His positioning reflects the shifting calculus for ambitious Democrats in a city fixated on issues of racial justice. Should Mr. Stringer run for mayor in 2017 or after, his fate may well rest with constituencies far outside his deepest well of support on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he has steadily climbed the ladder of Democratic politics since his days as a state legislator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The role Mr. Stringer is seeking to claim for himself may afford him new entree in those communities. With the Garner family and others, Mr. Stringer has avoided showy declarations of victory, typically issuing news releases and allowing the recipients and their lawyers to stage news conferences separately. (With some constituencies, the settlements have been less popular; Mr. Stringer's agreement with the Garner family, for example, drew a sharp rebuke from the Sergeants Benevolent Association.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Stringer has assertively advertised his role in appearances around the city, arguing that the financial power of the comptroller's office has become a tool for advancing civil rights. In his speeches, one frequent refrain is that ''there's only one color'' capable of rectifying the city's social inequities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That color, my friends, is green,'' he said at a Caribbean American Heritage Month celebration in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer disavowed any plans to challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, in 2017. But every comptroller for decades has run for mayor, sooner or later, and Mr. Stringer has been shoveling money into his campaign account. He reported collecting more than $1 million so far for the 2017 elections and had nearly $900,000 stockpiled. (Mr. de Blasio had a little more than $3,000 in the bank; a spokesman said he had not yet begun to raise re-election funds.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer explored a campaign for mayor in 2012, before opting to run for comptroller instead. In 2009, he briefly considered challenging in a Democratic primary Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who was appointed to the Senate from the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonnie Wong, president of Asian Women in Business, said she saw Mr. Stringer making a concerted effort to reach beyond his roots as ''an Upper West Side white liberal.'' She said Mr. Stringer had surprised some community leaders with his aggressiveness in tackling corporate diversity since moving up from the borough president's post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That position wasn't that powerful,'' Ms. Wong said. ''It was mostly a figurehead, so he didn't do that much. But he's amazing. He's like the Energizer Bunny. He's all over the place. I see a changed person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rev. A. R. Bernard, a prominent Brooklyn pastor whose congregation Mr. Stringer recently addressed, said the comptroller talked there about his settlements for wrongful convictions. ''In three minutes, he did pretty well,'' the pastor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bernard said his bond with Mr. Stringer was a work in progress. ''We've had a relationship for a while, and it's off and on,'' he said. ''It's not, I would say, a deep friendship.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Stringer is working intently to deepen his network of relationships now, the political task ahead of him may demand it. His race for comptroller in 2013 revealed a stark geographic and racial pattern to his political coalition: Mr. Stringer narrowly triumphed over Mr. Spitzer thanks to his overwhelming support in upscale Manhattan, as well as from whites and college-educated voters outside Manhattan, according to exit polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spitzer, a better known candidate who spent millions from his personal fortune on television advertising, won over a majority of black and Hispanic New Yorkers, and voters making under $50,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Floyd, the president of Teamsters Local 237, said the agenda Mr. Stringer has pursued in office was forged in that primary. ''I saw him come up with an agenda, come up with a mandate on what he needs to do as city comptroller,'' Mr. Floyd said. ''He has a vision. That's what I saw come out of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, Mr. Stringer's articulation of that vision can sound like an implicit critique of Mr. de Blasio. The mayor has made economic inequality his signature issue, and presented himself as a lifelong activist and political organizer. Mr. Stringer tells his audiences that activism is important, but at some point it must give way to the hard use of government power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stringer also came out last week against Mr. de Blasio's failed effort to limit the growth of the car-hailing service Uber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His job, Mr. Stringer said at an event in June, was to translate ''the marches and the speeches and the organizing'' into ''critical ways to change the economic power structure in this country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, the comptroller insisted he was not trying to draw a contrast in his rhetoric with any other politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do not compare or contrast what I'm doing with anybody,'' he said. ''I just don't.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> is about to toughen the rules on a type of investment vehicle that has been abused by some very wealthy families to avoid millions of dollars in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealthy are allowed to use family limited partnerships, family limited liability companies and their variants to hold family businesses, real estate or other illiquid, hard-to-value investments. And they can discount the value of the assets because that is seen as the only way people outside the family would buy in, particularly since nonfamily members have no control over what the partnership does.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some partnerships have put marketable securities, even cash, into the entities and still claimed a discount even though the investments have a value that is easy to determine. Others have taken steep and unreasonable discounts on the value of the partnership shares solely on the basis that the entity itself is family-owned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few have gone so far as to value the assets they hold at a steep discount for estate tax purposes only to turn around and liquidate the partnerships and distribute the cash as soon as the statute of limitations on estate tax audits has passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stung by its mixed record in challenging these entities in court, the I.R.S. could soon get help from the United States Treasury. Cathy Hughes, an attorney-adviser at the Treasury's office of tax policy, said in May that new regulations restricting what would be allowed with family partnerships could be released as soon as mid-September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exact terms of those regulations, when they take effect and whether the wealthy should scramble to make transfers now is anyone's guess. But some practitioners are resigned to an end of an era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a great run,'' said Diane E. Lederman, chief executive and president of Neuberger Berman Trust Company. ''There's been a tremendous amount of wealth transferred through these.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing the loopholes is something that the I.R.S., backed by the White House in recent years, has long wanted to do. ''Where you see the potential abuse is you have two taxpayers, each with $100 million,'' said Richard A. Behrendt, a former I.R.S. auditor who is now director of estate planning at Annex Wealth Management. ''One takes his lumps. The other wraps his $100 million in an entity that whacks 40 percent off the top. In the I.R.S. framework, that doesn't seem fair.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that the current estate tax exemption is nearly $11 million per couple, only very wealthy people have the need to set up one of these entities or the willingness to pay all the costs of maintaining them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the size of these entities means the estate tax savings from discounting their value -- or lost to the Treasury, depending on your view -- can be substantial. The White House estimated in 2012 that closing this loophole could bring in $18 billion in tax revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in cases where the assets in the family partnerships -- like securities and cash -- have an obvious value that does not support a discount of 30 percent or more, some advisers have argued that the partnership, not the individuals, controls when securities are bought and sold and distributions are made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax experts expect that entities that are set up to hold businesses or assets that require consolidated management, like rental properties, will continue to receive some sort of discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For any family with significant real estate, it's very typical for those families to use discounts in transferring interest in the entity,'' said Matt Brady, senior director of planning for Wells Fargo Private Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are practitioners in the legal field who don't feel justified in taking a discount for securities,'' he said. ''But it's the feeling that whatever the partnership holds is what the partnership holds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas J. Handler, a managing partner at Handler Thayer and a lawyer who has set up many partnerships, said that in the future the way these partnerships are created would matter more than pushing the envelope on the discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the last three transactions he put together had all been challenged by the I.R.S. Two involved businesses worth more than $100 million, and the third was a gift to one of these entities in excess of $25 million. The discount was reduced for only one, he said -- to 32.4 percent from 34.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In all three cases everything was buttoned up and tied together,'' he said. ''The I.R.S. doesn't want to go after complicated taxes. They want low-hanging fruit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his firm created what he called ''a threat matrix'' to determine when the I.R.S. had succeeded in its challenges. Big threats include big discounts -- 40 to 60 percent -- sloppy accounting for the family entity and poor documentation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he also encouraged all family members to become part of the entity on Day 1. ''The I.R.S. likes to see everyone is in,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are valid reasons for these entities beyond steep tax breaks. Ms. Lederman said a big one was having protection from a creditor -- or estranged spouse. Another is having a way to manage various types of assets in one entity. ''You really need to have a business purpose for these entities to receive a discount,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With not much time until the new regulations are expected, advisers are making suggestions on the margins. Because these partnerships are complicated and costly to set up, they generally cannot be rushed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Brady said he had been alerting clients who were already in the process of setting up a partnership or making gifts to one to accelerate what they were doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Get it in under the deadline,'' he said. ''It would be very hard for the I.R.S. to make the date retroactive. The I.R.S. would be hard pressed to go back and undo these.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Cody, managing director of estate, trust and philanthropy services at CTC myCFO, said he had been advising clients who made a gift of, say, 99 percent of a business into a partnership but retained a 1 percent stake, which carried with it all the voting rights, to consider selling that 1 percent stake now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For an ultra-wealthy family, getting rid of that 1 percent without any discount might make good sense so when mom and dad die, the family won't have to deal with it,'' he said. If that stake isn't sold, it could signal to the I.R.S. that the parents retained control and ''that 99 percent could be brought back into the estate by virtue of that 1 percent controlling stake,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, anyone trying to speed up the process needs to take heed. Mistakes in this realm can be costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Behrendt said he remembered one partnership where the man, a widower in his 80s, put everything, including his home, into a family limited partnership and was drawing income from the investments. The transfer was disregarded, and the assets were pulled back into his estate and taxed without the discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are subtler. Mr. Handler said he advised a client on the need to keep marital and nonmarital assets separate in his partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'You could never put an I.R.S. joint tax refund into that account,''' he said. ''It would be deemed a joint asset even though the husband was the only one working, and it would taint the partnership. That's what they did, and now she's entitled to half.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Innovation isn't all about eureka moments. In fact, the road to creative breakthroughs is paved with mundane, workaday tasks. That's the message of a recent study that might as well be titled ''In Praise of Tedium.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, researchers sought to examine how extended periods of free time affect innovation. To do this, they analyzed activity on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding website, in nearly 6,000 American cities. Kickstarter has proved to be a kind of petri dish for researchers who study innovation, said Ajay Agrawal, a management professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span> and one of the paper's authors. (Its other authors are Christian Catalini of the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and Avi Goldfarb of the <span class="companylink">University of Toronto</span>.)</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over a period of about nine months, the researchers found a sharp increase in the number of new projects posted during the first few days of school break periods. The spike, they suggest, is tied to people having more time to perform the administrative aspects of Kickstarter projects -- working on a manufacturing plan, say, or setting up a rewards schedule. While people may be using some stretches of free time to nurture those much lauded light bulb moments, the process of innovation also appears to require time to carry out execution-oriented tasks that are not particularly creative but still necessary to transform an idea into a product, the study indicates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lesson is that innovation is not just about invention, Professor Agrawal said. It's about the gritty parts in between, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers did not go so far as to say that time spent doing noncreative tasks benefits creativity during other periods, but Professor Agrawal said this could be true and is an idea worthy of further study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the study focused on activity during college breaks, the findings may have relevance for companies that have enacted -- or are thinking of enacting -- ''slack time'' policies that allow employees to take time away from their daily tasks to work on their own projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most companies these days claim to be very pro-innovation,'' Professor Agrawal said. But they may need to adopt a more nuanced view of what that actually means. Moving innovation forward requires effort and time not directly related to the idea itself, he said, and ''there is clearly some balance needed between structured time and unstructured time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, precious few innovations become successful -- a reality that employers need to accept if they embrace ''slack time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big ideas come from a very small fraction of people, but it's very hard to predict in advance who those people will be,'' Professor Agrawal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bet that organizations need to make is that the value from those few people who have the very big ideas will be so worthwhile that they're willing to give everybody a certain amount of 'slack time,' '' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- As stock markets have tumbled, public company shareholders were not the only ones wondering what would become of their portfolios. Venture capitalists also began fretting about whether the plunge -- which resulted last week in the worst week for American stocks since 2011 and a renewed sell-off on Monday -- would cool the heady market for shares of private companies, especially in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is reason to worry: The number of start-ups valued at $1 billion or more has jumped to at least 131, up from fewer than a dozen in 2010, according to the research firm CB Insights. The total amount of venture money invested has also more than doubled, to $50 billion in 2014, from $23 billion in 2010, with venture funding in the second quarter exceeding $17 billion for the first time since the end of 2000, according to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>. That has some wondering if it's time for Silicon Valley's heat to cool off.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet those anticipating a collapse in start-up land will probably have to wait. Any adverse effect on venture-backed companies is likely to be uneven and more complicated than a straight bust. Instead, the effect of a stock market rout is set to move slowly across the start-up landscape, creating a gulf between well-run companies with achievable business plans and those that were funded as part of the back-everything frenzy that began earlier in the decade. But once negative sentiment takes hold, a more widespread downward spiral could quickly unfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason that there will most likely be no uniform start-up deflation is rooted in the pricing of private company stocks. The prices for start-up shares, which are closely held by small groups of investors, generally reset only when the founders go into the market to raise money. (In contrast, public stock prices rise and fall every day in response to a company's performance and market sentiment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few years, start-up share prices have gone up nearly every time a private company has raised money. Investors were largely optimistic and generous because they assumed that a variety of factors -- including low interest rates, a strengthening American economy and the growing Chinese middle class -- would keep the markets positive. Spending more to help a start-up grow into a huge company seemed like a reasonable bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is only when companies absolutely need to collect new financing that the rubber may hit the road -- that's when investors may want more reassurances that the start-ups can survive without the crutch of venture money to subsidize growth. If a start-up cannot provide those reassurances, or if a company has burned through all of its money from previous funding rounds without reaching agreed-upon goals, that could spell trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in the immediate future, a downturn that spreads to Silicon Valley start-ups ''will affect those companies that need to raise capital,'' said Matthew Rubin, the director of investment strategy at the asset management firm <span class="companylink">Neuberger Berman</span>. He said it could take several months for a market collapse to affect the valuations of high-flying private tech names.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist, raised the issue of changing fortunes for start-ups last week when he voiced his fears of about a slowdown on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. ''Investors are likely to refocus on business model viability and path to profitability,'' he wrote. ''This will seem like an abrupt sea change to many.'' He wondered how many entrepreneurs would be prepared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Start-ups that cannot adapt to a world that prizes profit over growth may ultimately be forced to raise money at the same or lower valuation than in the past, something referred to as a ''down round.'' Those can be debilitating: Employee stock options usually become less valuable when a company's valuation falls, making it harder to retain people. If a company has raised many rounds of capital, later investors often have protections that guarantee a specific cash payout or return on investment. In a down round, those protections are paid for out of the returns that would have gone to earlier investors and employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As those companies flounder, however, others that have been prudent stewards of capital and can show a path toward profit will still attract capital, especially as billions of dollars held by venture and sovereign wealth funds have not yet been invested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2014, venture firms including <span class="companylink">Norwest Venture Partners</span>, Founders Fund, <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> and <span class="companylink">Institutional Venture Partners</span> have each raised at least $1 billion for new funds. <span class="companylink">Temasek</span>, Singapore's state investment company, and other sovereign funds have also begun putting more money into private tech companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venky Ganesan, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Menlo Ventures</span>, said the phenomenon of high-valuation tech start-ups and a market awash in easy money encouraged companies to spend at breakneck speeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is already a chill in the late-stage funding market,'' he said. That's partly because start-ups have become dependent on mutual funds and other public market investors for cash. Every quarter they can mark down the value of their private holdings, which could cast doubt on the valuations of start-ups in the same lines of business. ''If you see down rounds and mutual funds report losses on private companies, then things will spiral downward very fast,'' Mr. Ganesan said. ''Like in 'Game of Thrones,' winter is coming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Mak, the director of Stanford's Real-Time Analysis and Investment Lab, said financing was still readily available for young companies. He is also an adviser to a three-year-old commerce start-up called Massdrop that closed a $40 million investment two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We started the fund-raising process two and a half months ago when the market was falling, and it didn't have a major effect,'' Mr. Mak said. ''When and if we see the market fall 20 percent or more, it will filter through more. But it will primarily be the frothiness of the market coming down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is probably not a bad thing if some private companies stumble, since the start-up market lately has been like Lake Wobegon, a place where all businesses have been above average. Any venture capitalist will also say that the majority of start-up investments lose money and the few bets that pay off offset the losses. So it may be better to identify ailing companies, especially among the enormous $1 billion valuation club, earlier rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lots of founders today weren't around in 1999, and they don't know a thing about financial markets beyond what's happened in the last 24 months,'' Mr. Gurley said in an interview. ''To them that's how this game is played, money is cheap and everything goes up. That's why we have cycles.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Geer, who is a Swedish entrepreneur and the co-founder of iZettle, a payments service that offers merchants a device for processing credit card transactions, says banks don't meet the needs of many small businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Financial institutions focus more on their large clients than on the small ones,'' he said. ''Most of them were founded way before the invention of the Internet or the smartphone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he thinks he has a solution. On Friday, <span class="companylink">iZettle</span> announced a program to lend money to small businesses that use its service, providing cash advances to companies for a one-time fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IZettle, which operates in 11 countries from Britain to Brazil, raised a further $67 million from its existing backers, including <span class="companylink">Intel Capital</span> and <span class="companylink">American Express</span>, to take its total fund-raising to roughly $180 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steps by <span class="companylink">iZettle</span> follow similar announcements from Square, the six-year-old American payments start-up, that also has expanded from its payments roots to offer additional financial products for its small-business customers. Square also offers a device to process credit card transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">iZettle</span>, the new lending program will initially be available only in Europe, and the company will charge small businesses a flat fee equivalent to roughly 10 to 15 percent of each cash advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To recoup the money it lends to businesses, the start-up will take a small percentage of each transaction that small businesses process through its payments system. To reduce defaults, the company says it will crunch data from businesses' existing transactions to determine their credit risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see our customers are very underserved by traditional financial players,'' said Mr. de Geer. ''We're transforming ourselves into something that resembles a next-generation financial services company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IZettle is not the only tech start-up looking to offer loans to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Funding Circle, a London-based peer-to-peer lender, raised a further $150 million, which valued the company at roughly $1 billion. The start-up operates a platform in Britain and the United States that allows individuals to lend directly to businesses.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in stocks is at times compared to a thrill ride -- a rocket ship taking off, or a roller coaster rushing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparison may be more apt than usual for a new investment -- a 630-foot Ferris wheel under construction on Staten Island -- that soon will be marketed via a Wall Street version of crowdfunding.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project leaders of the New York Wheel, which has already raised around $450 million in equity and debt, plan to seek another $30 million through North Capital Private Securities, a Utah broker-dealer that intends to sell some of the new shares via its 99Funding online crowdfunding platform and other crowdfunding sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding on websites like Kickstarter has allowed people and organizations to raise money for various projects from supporters who don't have any formal economic interest in the ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous online venues, often in partnership with smaller and midsize securities firms such as North Capital, have adopted provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, which loosened restrictions on stock sales by business start-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Dowd, founder and chief executive of North Capital, said he believed that the $500 million New York Wheel project ''is going to be the largest transaction we're aware of that has crowdfunding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of these new shares is possible under a JOBS Act provision that went into effect in 2013, allowing private stock sales to ''accredited'' wealthy investors who meet certain income or net-worth tests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some of the shares will be sold conventionally by brokers, Mr. Dowd said, other shares will be sold through 99Funding to ''self-directed investors,'' those who sign up on their own. He said the offering was planned for a 90-day period before the year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Wheel was originally backed by a group of wealthy investors including the real estate moguls Jeffrey Feil and Lloyd Goldman and the Jordache jeans magnate Joseph Nakash, according to Rich Marin, the project's chief executive. A sprawling outlet mall is also planned nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marin and Mr. Dowd are longtime business associates who both previously worked at <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Bankers Trust</span>. North Capital plans to add up to a dozen other crowdfunding sites to participate in the fund-raising, and expects to set a minimum investment size of $5,000 to $10,000, Mr. Dowd added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction on the wheel began in May, after the project raised $195 million in senior debt from the Highbridge Capital Management hedge fund unit of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, and $150 million in additional debt from CanAm Enterprises, under an American program that allows foreign nationals -- CanAm investors, in this case -- to gain legal residency in the United States by making job-creating investments. Another $24 million is due next month from the CanAm investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign of risk associated with the project is that the Highbridge debt carries an interest rate of 10.25 percent. But the CanAm interest rate is just 2.75 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier effort at selling stock to round out financing for the wheel -- which began last fall by another securities firm, <span class="companylink">Houlihan Lokey</span> -- raised $31 million, falling about $15 million short of its target, Mr. Marin said. The project's original backers invested about $80 million, he added. The Houlihan sale was cut short by the New York Wheel project leaders, who needed to close other components of the financing -- curtailing Houlihan's time to try to raise the remaining funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ability of start-ups to raise money via crowdfunding is expected to expand further once securities regulators complete the rules under another part of the JOBS Act that will allow businesses to raise funds from accredited and unaccredited investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dara Albright, a crowd-finance expert who co-founded the LendIt and FinFair conferences on alternative finance, cautions investors not to lose sight of the inherent risks in such ventures, especially since these investors don't typically get the same amount of information about sales, profits and other business metrics that public companies are required to disclose. ''These things are risky,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> informed its shareholders on Tuesday that the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> had decided not to issue a private letter ruling on its proposal to spin off its $23 billion stake in Alibaba. Such a ruling would have ensured that the spinoff would be tax-free to <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and its shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> indicated that it was continuing to work on the spinoff. As proposed, the deal would place <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>'s small-business division into a holding company, Aabaco, along with the Alibaba stake.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility is that the spinoff will proceed as planned, relying on a legal-opinion letter from the law firm <span class="companylink">Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom</span> to reassure shareholders that it should be tax-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if it isn't tax-free?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is a taxable transaction, it will be a blood bath from a tax point of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least two bad things will happen. The first is that <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> itself will face a tax bill of about $7 billion on the distribution of Aabaco to its shareholders. Under a doctrine known to tax lawyers as the ''repeal of General Utilities,'' section 311(d) of the tax code imposes tax liability on a corporation when it distributes appreciated property to its shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, in other words, will face the same tax bill it would have faced had it sold the underlying Alibaba stock. The difference is that it will not have any cash with which to pay its taxes. I explain this in more detail below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second bad consequence of a failed spinoff will be that <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>'s shareholders will not recognize dividend income equal to the fair market value of the Aabaco shares they received. Making matters worse, the <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> shareholders will not receive any cash in the distribution. Some of them might have to sell the newly received Aabaco shares in order to pay the tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> has expressed confidence in its tax advisers, but at the same time, it is taking steps to protect its own hindquarters in case of a failed spinoff. Aabaco's registration statement, filed in July, explains, ''Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, subject to limited exceptions, the fund will be required to indemnify <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, its subsidiaries and specified related persons for taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the code.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What this means is that if the spinoff fails, Aabaco will pay back <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> for any taxes that <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> has to pay as a result of the failed transaction. The indemnification ensures <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> a seat in this game of musical tax chairs. Aabaco, not <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, would effectively be on the hook for a $7 billion tax bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cover the tax liability, Aabaco will presumably have to sell about a third of its Alibaba stake, or perhaps borrow the amount using the Alibaba stock as collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens next is unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> may decide to play chicken with the I.R.S. and charge ahead. If <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> closes the deal fast enough, it puts the I.R.S. in a tough spot. Historically, the I.R.S. has been reluctant to challenge the tax treatment of public deals after they close. No one at the I.R.S. wants to go after thousands of individual <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> shareholders for unpaid dividend taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the I.R.S. is going to scotch the deal, it's more likely to do so before the spinoff closes. If the I.R.S. is indeed taking a serious look at the spinoff rules, it should give some preliminary guidance as to what the new rules would look like, and it should do so sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the I.R.S. could say that there must be a business purpose for any cash or liquid securities contributed to SpinCo (in this case, Aabaco). Because there is no conceivable nontax business purpose for <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>'s small-business division to hold billions of dollars of Alibaba stock, such a statement would force an end to the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't think there's a simple way for <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> to avoid paying taxes on the appreciation of its stake in Alibaba. It would probably be better off selling the stock, paying the tax, distributing what's left to its shareholders and letting its management get back to concentrating on the core business.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When friends heard that James Higgins, 31, his wife, Trish, 29, and his brother Palmer, 27, left their traditional jobs in finance and sold their charming Greenwich, Conn., townhouse, they assumed it was for an exciting opportunity elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They did not imagine that would turn out to be a snow removal and landscaping company in southern Maine.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Higginses are part of a growing trend: people with an entrepreneurial bent who are not inclined to start their own businesses. Rather, these people look to buy small to midsize companies -- often family-owned firms that are being sold by the founder -- and help them prosper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest in this area is growing, experts say, for a number of reasons. First, baby boomers who started their own businesses -- and who do not have children or successors -- are ready to sell and retire. Additionally, money is easier to borrow than it has been in the last several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And ''it offers a third way,'' said Royce Yudkoff, a professor at <span class="companylink">Harvard Business School</span>, who with his colleague Richard Ruback teaches a course on the financial management of smaller firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is not as risky as a start-up, it is not as safe as going the corporate path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The option appeals to people who ''want to be their own boss, help build an organization and be part of a community,'' Professor Yudkoff said. And unlike working in a corporation, he says, it draws those who want to deal on a daily basis with people who are quite different from themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are the reasons the Higginses chose this path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel like I've spent a huge amount of my career analyzing and very little actually doing something,'' Ms. Higgins said. ''I want to go out and get my hands dirty and use my education to contribute and be a business leader in a community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Higgins left her job a few months ago as a strategy associate for <span class="companylink">AQR Capital Management</span>. James Higgins has converted Chenmark Capital Management, a hedge fund he founded five years ago -- and which his brother joined a year ago -- into a firm that invests in small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three started their search in the most elementary of ways: with <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We searched, 'how to buy a small business,' and found out there's a whole world out there,'' James Higgins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That world works much as the residential real estate market does. Sites like BizBuySell.com and BizQuest.com advertise companies for sale, usually with a broker's name included in the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of small businesses grew by 58 percent from 2012 to 2014, the latest year numbers are available on BizBuySell.com, said Bob House, the general manager of BizBuySell.com and BizQuest.com, part of the CoStar Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BizBuySell.com is one of the largest such sites in North America; Mr. House said it had 47,000 active listings. The companies' prices can range from millions to less than $100,000, with a median sale price of $200,000. The largest categories are restaurants and retail businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with buying a house, the broker represents the seller, Mr. House said. The commission varies, depending on geography and the size of the business, but averages about 10 percent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Higginses set out a few parameters. They wanted a company not too big and not too small, so they decided to look for one with a purchase price of $3 million to $10 million, and they would use their own money and investments from family. It could be anywhere in the country, and offer just about any service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We created a superwide funnel,'' James Higgins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they searched, they started narrowing that funnel. They realized the best bet was a company that carried out a niche service, where there might not be a lot of growth potential, but there also was not much competition, and the company could perform well over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to make sure no one in China or no one in San Francisco could compete our jobs away,'' James Higgins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process was straightforward: They would contact the broker representing the business, who would vet them to make sure they were serious buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Higginses looked over about 1,000 businesses, had 75 conference calls and visited 10 businesses, stretching from Nevada to Cape Cod, and as varied as conveyor belt maintenance and event planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found that the sellers typically were in one of two groups: owners looking to retire who had no succession plan in place, or those in their mid-40s or so, who had a lot of professional experience in their particular field but did not have the management and financial expertise of people like the Higginses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second type of sellers ''were eager to take their company to the next level, but wanted someone to partner with,'' James Higgins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. House said a survey of business brokers found that 75 percent of buyers last year were 30 to 49 years old, and 24 percent were 50 to 64. Although older buyers tended to be white, the survey found that just over half of the buyers in the 18-to-29 age group were Asian, Hispanic or African-American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because not everyone can afford to look for and buy a small business, an option that has grown in popularity is the use of search funds. These are funds supplied by a group of investors to an entrepreneur to search and acquire a small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers can also find ways to get creative with the financing, as did Devin Mackoff, 29, who this year bought a landscaping business, with revenue of $250,000 to $500,000 annually, on Cape Cod.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He put down around $150,000 as a down payment for the business, including equipment and assets, and guaranteed the sellers about 10 percent of the revenue over the next three years. Mr. Mackoff's father was also was willing to invest in the company as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mackoff had worked as a management consultant in Boston since graduating from college, but ''from a young age, I thought I wanted my own business, but never had the financial resources.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the Higginses, he was looking in a narrow geographical area and wanted to stay close to Boston. He had also worked summers as a landscaper, so he knew he could do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Landscape Cod came up for sale by a husband-and-wife team who owned three other businesses and felt they were stretched too thin, Mr. Mackoff was ready. He took over the company at the start of the busy season, and it has been busy ever since, he said, adding that his father was a critical part of his team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've learned a lot about myself over the past three to four months,'' he said. ''I've always been good dealing with customers, but it's finding and keeping good employees that's a challenge -- and that's true across the whole industry.'' He serves 50 customers with five to six employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This morning I got a text message from an employee saying he's no longer working for us,'' he said, ''so I was out in the field all day instead of doing what I was planning to do -- managing the company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Campbell, who served as the broker on Mr. Mackoff's deal, said he now had 15 to 20 businesses for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the business is priced right and it has a track record of earning, it typically takes three to six months to complete a deal,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some days Mr. Mackoff wonders why he chose this difficult path, but ''I know I would have a huge regret in my life if I didn't do it,'' he said. ''I get to say I own a business and I don't know a lot of 29-year-olds who can say that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's all to come for the Higginses. The owners of the Maine company, who are eager to expand, will stay on as partners of the business -- something the Higginses are grateful for. Confident the deal would go through, they bought a condominium in Maine and moved there last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final negotiations have dragged on longer than expected, but in the last week, things have started to look more positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been a number of sleepless nights lately, but recently we've been able to resolve some of the issues and we're looking forward to completing the purchase and forming a long-term partnership with the sellers,'' James Higgins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just in case the plan goes awry, they have checked out two other options in the last month -- a specialized advertising and publishing company in Atlanta and a food manufacturer in British Columbia.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way Jon Stein sees it, receiving financial advice for retirement should be a fundamental right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betterment, the investment firm Mr. Stein created just five years ago, is now one of the more prominent of the so-called robo-advisers -- companies that automatically build and manage customized portfolios of low-cost investments for people who cannot afford the type of financial adviser who sits behind a mahogany desk.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He argues that all workers who save using a 401(k) should be entitled to personalized help and investment management services: When an employer offers a retirement plan without any recommendations, Mr. Stein reasons, it's akin to providing a health insurance plan that lists medications without any doctors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that philosophy, perhaps it was only a matter of time before his firm -- with 106,000 customers and $2.6 billion in assets -- would plunge into the 401(k) business. Starting in the first quarter of next year, the firm will begin offering the plans to employers, with a focus on smaller businesses (though it's essentially equipped to handle larger ones, too).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses, which employ nearly half of all private sector workers, could surely use the help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 14 percent of employers with fewer than 100 employees offer a 401(k) plan, according to a report from the <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span>. Even when these workers have access to a 401(k), they often pay three times as much as workers at larger companies, if not more. And if the business owner bought the 401(k) plan from a broker, the investment lineup might be rife with conflicts of interest and high-cost, actively managed mutual funds. As for financial advice, it's not always an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the landscape is rapidly evolving. In addition to Betterment, several other technology-driven providers have started offering 401(k) plans in recent years, with a focus on reducing costs and the complex administrative burdens for small employers. <span class="companylink">Vanguard</span> started catering to smaller businesses about four years ago and has already signed up more than 4,000 employers covering 162,000 participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein said he hoped to elevate 401(k) plans to the next level, bringing the kind of holistic service that personal finance nerds could only dream of. You know, things like automatic management and rebalancing, taking into account your rollover Individual Retirement Account, a spouse's plans and future Social Security benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By looking at the entire picture, it can tell you how much you need to save and in which accounts -- say a 401(k) versus a Roth or taxable account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is like fundamental stuff that everyone should have a right to if we are going to put the responsibility of saving for retirement on individuals, which is what we've done in this country,'' said Mr. Stein from Betterment's offices, a loft space that was formerly a dojo, or martial arts studio, in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since all of this advice is driven by algorithms, not humans, it helps contain costs: 401(k) plans with less than $1 million in assets had an average cost of 1.6 percent of the plan's total assets in 2012. That compares with 0.54 percent for plans with $100 million to $250 million, according to a research report by <span class="companylink">BrightScope</span> and the <span class="companylink">Investment Company Institute</span> in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fees for small plans also tend to vary greatly. The vast majority of 401(k)'s with less than $1 million in total assets had costs that ranged somewhere from 0.68 percent to a scandalous 2.66 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason is economics. Small plans have less money to manage, so they generate less in fees and have less negotiating power. But another driving factor is the way the industry is structured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has tended to attract the high-cost providers in part because of the economics, but in part because in this area of the market, the plans are sold, not bought,'' said Mike Alfred, co-founder and chief executive of BrightScope, which tracks and rates retirement plans. ''So there is an adviser or rep going into that company and convincing the chief executive officer, human resources or the chief financial officer to set up a plan,'' he added. ''And usually the high-cost providers are the ones that have the economics to pay the adviser to support that effort.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In case you haven't already heard, paying all those fees can seriously affect your nest egg: Paying just 1 percentage point more annually could reduce savings by nearly 30 percent over an individual's working career, according to Labor Department calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine an employee who saved $25,000 in a 401(k); she doesn't make any new contributions and earns 7 percent over the next 35 years. If she paid 0.5 percent in total fees, the account would grow to $227,000. But paying fees totaling 1.5 percent would leave her with $163,000 -- that's 28 percent less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the tiniest companies, Betterment will charge .60 percent of plan assets, plus the cost of the actual investments, which tend to be another .1 percent, on average. There is also a $1,500 setup fee for new plans. The fees decline as the company's assets grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those expenses are all inclusive, wrapping in the customized, automatically managed portfolio and all of the administrative work that a 401(k) plan demands, a task that is often handled by a third-party administrator or record-keeping firm. (<span class="companylink">Vanguard</span>, for instance, works with Ascensus.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Stein said Betterment built its own system from scratch, which means the managed investment accounts can talk directly to its record-keeping arm. That, he says, has enabled the company to simplify many administrative tasks and regulatory compliance, making life easier for employers sponsoring the plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His team learned a lot when they were shopping around for their own 401(k), back in early 2014 when they had about 50 employees. ''We found this process to be super difficult for us, and we are pretty sophisticated,'' said Mr. Stein, who ultimately chose <span class="companylink">Vanguard</span>. Though <span class="companylink">Vanguard</span> charges a flat fee per participant, he said it cost them the equivalent of 0.82 percent of total assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plans, now requires plan providers to itemize their costs of services -- separating investment costs from administrative ones -- comparing plan prices can still be mind-boggling, particularly for a time-constrained entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department is now trying to take its oversight a step further, and has proposed a rule that would require more brokers to act in the best interest of their small business customers when selling retirement plans and suggesting investments, a rule that is now easily bypassed. (Brokers must meet a five-part test before they are deemed a fiduciary, which means they must put their customers' interest before their own.) Depending on how the final rule is written, it could force even more transparency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial services industry has argued that such a rule would make it too costly to work with smaller investors and plans, but there are plenty of providers, including Betterment, lining up to take their place, at least in the 401(k) space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Busque, a co-founder of TaskRabbit, the online marketplace that connects individuals with people willing to complete small jobs, is gearing up to introduce a 401(k) plan to small employers through his new start-up, Guideline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company, Dream Forward Financial, goes beyond lowering costs and providing a modernized interface. Its 401(k) service will attempt to address the reasons people don't save for retirement, like buying a home or sending a child to college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ForUsAll, Captain401 and America's Best 401(k) are a few other newer players, while Employee Fiduciary, <span class="companylink">Capital One</span>'s ShareBuilder 401(k) and Ubiquity (formerly the Online 401(k)) have each offered lower-cost plans for at least a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are using low-cost funds and exchange-traded funds, so it is a lot cleaner and cheaper for everyone,'' said William Trout, a senior analyst at Celent who tracks technology-focused financial firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rising number of options, there hasn't been a better time for workers in small businesses to make a case to their employer for a new or improved 401(k) plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is something of a national scandal,'' Mr. Trout said. ''We lionize small business in this country. But the fact of the matter is that part of working for a small business means paying a lot more -- and in many cases, twice as much more -- for their 401(k) plans than big corporate employees.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public benefit corporations are a relatively new designation that has been signed into law by a number of states. Delaware, where Kickstarter is reincorporating, began allowing public benefit corporations in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the designation, companies must aim to do something that would aid the public (such as Kickstarter's mission to ''help bring creative projects to life'') and include that goal in their corporate charter. Board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions, and the company has to report on its social impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Public benefit corporations will harness the power of private enterprise to create public benefit,'' Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said in 2013, adding that such companies ''consider profit to be the means -- not the exclusive end goal -- of their business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter's move builds upon its decision last year to become a <span class="companylink">B Corporation</span>, a voluntary designation certified by a nonprofit group called B Lab. To become a <span class="companylink">B Corp</span>, companies must meet rigorous environmental and social-responsibility standards, which they report annually to shareholders -- though taking on the status has no legal impact. Other companies, including the e-commerce site <span class="companylink">Etsy</span>, which went public in April, and <span class="companylink">Warby Parker</span>, the eyeglasses retailer, have also opted to become B Corps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this stands in stark contrast to the behavior of many tech start-ups these days. With money having flowed freely into tech enterprises in recent years, businesses like the ride-hailing company Uber, the room-rental start-up <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and the online storage service <span class="companylink">Dropbox</span> have all raised billions from venture capitalists and big money managers, with the aim of large profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Becoming a public benefit corporation does not prevent Kickstarter from selling itself or going public, and it remains a for-profit entity. Still, as a <span class="companylink">B Corp</span> and now a public benefit corporation, legal experts say, Kickstarter is holding itself to a particularly high standard of transparency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A public benefit corporation is only required to report its social and environmental performance to shareholders every two years,'' said Kyle Westaway, a lawyer based in New York and managing partner of his own practice, who works with public benefit corporations. ''But Kickstarter chose to go above and beyond and report to the public every year as a <span class="companylink">B Corp</span>. This represents a real commitment to transparency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter, which is based in New York, was founded by Mr. Chen, Mr. Strickler and Charles Adler, who is now an adviser, in 2009. Its site lets anyone pitch projects to the public to raise money, and Kickstarter earns fees from every successfully funded project on its platform. Kickstarter has helped fund high-profile products like the ''Veronica Mars'' movie and the Pebble smartwatch, but has also faced controversies, including complaints that prominent musicians and filmmakers have exploited the crowdfunding model while not being fully transparent with their backers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other companies, some of the stipulations Kickstarter put into its charter as a public benefit corporation would be anathema. Kickstarter is exceptionally charitable, for instance, donating 5 percent of after-tax profits to causes that support the arts and combat inequality. Kickstarter has also agreed to ''not use loopholes or other esoteric but legal tax management strategies to reduce its tax burden.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter decided to become a public benefit corporation because ''there's a huge difference between a values document and the legal foundation of your company,'' said Mr. Chen, who serves as chairman but focuses on making art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter still has investors to answer to. While the company has not yet raised much money -- less than $15 million, with the founders retaining majority ownership -- some well-known tech investors have backed it. They include Chris Sacca, a former <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who became a big investor in <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, as well as <span class="companylink">Union Square Ventures</span>, a venture capital firm based in New York, and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the investors said they knew what they were getting into, as Mr. Chen and Mr. Strickler made it clear early on that they were not looking for a massive payday from Kickstarter. Mr. Sacca said he believed there were other ways for shareholders to see returns from their investment in Kickstarter besides an acquisition or an initial public offering. It helps that Kickstarter's financial trajectory has been strong. Mr. Chen and Mr. Strickler say their company has been profitable for years -- in the $5 million to $10 million range per year for each of the last three years -- and has continually reinvested that money in the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a fast-growing, highly profitable enterprise. So, as an owner of the stock, I feel comfortable that I will be rewarded for that,'' Mr. Sacca said. ''When the time is right, I'm confident that Kickstarter will return cash to their loyal shareholders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rejecting the idea of an I.P.O. or acquisition may hurt Kickstarter's recruiting, since those common practices attract engineers to start-ups with the promise of prosperity. But the Kickstarter co-founders said the company's stance had attracted like-minded people -- those more focused on the overall mission and less on the value of their equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's allowed us to find people who have a similar idealism,'' Mr. Chen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kickstarter has also taken the unconventional step of letting employees exercise their option grants for up to 10 years, even if they leave the company. And the co-founders said they planned to begin paying a dividend to shareholders and employees in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not going to be a huge lottery ticket,'' Mr. Chen said. ''It's going to be profits shared on an annual basis. We'll all benefit from what's created.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chen and Mr. Strickler said their ultimate hope was that becoming a public benefit corporation would set an example for the next generation of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As younger companies come up and think about how they operate and how they want to be structured, maybe they won't be so easily swept up by all the usual choices,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Maybe they'll be thinking long term, thinking about how to look after the things they care about.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 1 last year, the website Rescator, known as the ''<span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> of the black market,'' alerted its customers that huge quantities of stolen debit and credit card data would go on sale the next day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Load your accounts and prepare for an avalanche of cash!'' the website urged.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, two batches of cardholder data were reportedly sold, according to legal documents. The website claimed the cards were 100 percent valid and working. Demand was so high that the website temporarily crashed. Over the next few days, several more batches of card data were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 8, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> issued a news release admitting its data systems had been breached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, the damage had been done. Approximately 56 million sets of card data had been stolen, some of which were sold on the black market and remained valid for several days. At a small credit union in California, fraudulent charges of more than $100,000 were posted in just three minutes after the card information was sold on the black market. A bank reported $300,000 in suspicious charges in two hours to the security blog Krebs on Security, which connected <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> with the stolen cards before the retailer did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> data breach, we weren't even told for days that it existed. That it had happened,'' said Diana Dykstra, the chief executive of the California and Nevada Credit Union Leagues. ''We didn't know that the cards had been sold on the black market. It hit credit unions and small banks really hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, the full tally of the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> data breach remains unknown. Some estimate the fraudulent charges total well into the billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last couple of years, retailing has been a rich hunting ground for online criminals. They hacked into numerous companies, including <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span>, <span class="companylink">Sally Beauty</span> and the crafts store Michaels. But the orchestrated theft at Target in late 2013, followed a few months later by the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> data breach, eclipsed all of the others. So far, there have been no arrests in the Target and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> breaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the size and scope of such attacks at retailers has grown, so have the losses, which have been largely shouldered by financial institutions. Now some small banks and others want <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and those companies that suffer data breaches to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One front of the battle is a federal lawsuit winding through the courts, filed by a number of small community banks and credit unions that contend <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> long ignored internal and external warnings from security experts that its systems were vulnerable to attack. A similar lawsuit against Target claims that its security protocols were ''so deficient that the breach continued for nearly three weeks while Target failed to even notice it.'' That lawsuit was given class-action status this month by a federal judge in Minnesota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as the lawsuits move forward, retailers are scrambling to meet a deadline to install machines to read E.M.V. microchips -- the small metallic rectangles increasingly found on the front of credit and debit cards, named after Europay, <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> and <span class="companylink">Visa</span>, the original backers of the standard. After Thursday, retailers that have not upgraded their systems to read the new chip-enabled cards will be liable for any charges from counterfeit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Essentially, whoever has the lower level of security will be the one who will be responsible for the unauthorized transaction,'' said Doug Johnson, a senior vice president of payments and security policy at the <span class="companylink">American Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, that's likely to remain the banks. By some estimates, only 19 percent of credit and debit cards in circulation will be chip-enabled by the deadline. ''It cuts both ways,'' Mr. Johnson acknowledged. ''If we don't deploy the chip cards, we maintain the liability that we have currently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers and banks are spending billions of dollars to upgrade to the new chip cards. While they hope the cards will slam the door on criminals obtaining financial data that can be used to create and sell counterfeit cards, they warn that other windows for fraud will remain wide open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The expectation is that organized criminals are going to move from the physical world to the online world,'' said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks card industry data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit card fraud losses totaled $8 billion last year, but many consumers may see it as a victimless crime. Certainly there is a high hassle factor around reporting suspicious transactions to the bank or waiting for a reissued card to be mailed, but consumers are generally not held responsible for the fraudulent charges that occur. (Furthermore, experts say while consumers were nervous after the Target and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> data breaches, there is no evidence that they shifted their spending patterns to use cash rather than plastic.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, a majority of the fraud losses are absorbed by financial institutions, which have become increasingly concerned as the sweep of data breaches at retailers widens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, when a credit or debit card number was stolen and used to buy goods elsewhere, the banks or financial institutions digested the losses. Then, in cases where the retailer was found to be in breach of security standards, <span class="companylink">Visa</span> and <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> would seek reimbursement for costs associated with the fraud and disburse that money back to the affected financial institutions through a preset formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, for instance, <span class="companylink">TJX Companies</span>, the owner of <span class="companylink">T.J. Maxx</span> and Marshalls stores, settled with <span class="companylink">Visa</span> and others for $40.9 million to cover costs associated with a large data breach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small community banks and credit unions say the disbursement of any money collected from retailers rarely, if ever, makes it to their doors. Most goes to large banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've not received any payments at all for any fraudulent activity,'' said Marques Doppler, the chief executive of Profinium, a 140-year-old family-owned bank with four branches in Southern Minnesota and around $350 million in assets. Mr. Doppler declined to say how much Profinium, which is one of the plaintiffs in the <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> litigation, lost to fraudulent charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For small community banks like Profinium or nonprofit credit unions, a little fraud can hurt in a big way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A $100,000 fraud loss to a large financial institution is nothing. But a lot of credit unions have annual net income that is less than $1 million. If you take a couple of big fraud hits, that's substantial for them,'' said Bill Hampel, chief policy officer and chief economist with the <span class="companylink">Credit Union National Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, it can cost small banks or credit unions much more to reissue cards involved in a data breach. The average cost to reissue cards affected by the Target breach, according to a survey of banks conducted by the A.B.A. last summer, ranged from $2.70 per card for large banks to $12.75 for banks with less than $1 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a number of community banks and credit unions filed lawsuits against Target and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, seeking bigger payouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, the lawsuit alleges that the retailer had ignored multiple warnings about its vulnerabilities since 2008. The suit says <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> failed to turn on a feature of the 2007 version of <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> antivirus software specifically designed to spot malware that attacks point-of-sale terminals. <span class="companylink">Symantec</span>'s contractors grew so concerned about <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s approach to security that three of them refused to continue to work for the company and <span class="companylink">Symantec</span> threatened to cease doing business with <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an employee in 2010 discovered a major security flaw that allowed unauthorized access to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s network through devices used by its in-store sales force, the employee was ignored for months. Then he was fired, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting around April 2014, hackers gained access to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s computer systems using the credentials of a third-party vendor. Targeting the self-checkout registers, the hackers installed malware that siphoned off the information from a payment card when it was swiped on a checkout terminal. The malware remained on <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s terminals for five months, until around Sept. 7, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> has broadly denied the allegations. ''There's a lot of misinformation out there about this, much of it based on speculation, rumors and opinion by individuals who don't have the facts, and we'll address them in the proper forum,'' said Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the data breach has been costly for the retailer. In regulatory filings, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said expenses tied to the breach so far total $232 million, partly offset by $100 million in insurance proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers say a good insurance policy will cover expenses related to investigating the data breach, public relations, call-center services and credit monitoring services as well as costs arising from lawsuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for retailers is buying enough of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're a retailer, it's hard to buy more than $125 million in coverage in today's market,'' said Roberta D. Anderson, a co-founder of the Cyber Law and Cybersecurity practice group at the <span class="companylink">K&amp;L Gates</span> law firm. ''Obviously, the potential liability is so much more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the lawsuit against <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> moves forward, the retailer and others are spending billions of dollars -- $100 million at Target alone -- to upgrade their registers to accept chip-enabled cards. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> says all of its stores will be ready to read chip cards by the Thursday deadline. The retailing giant <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> says its stores were chip-ready almost a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone is hoping that the new chip cards will be much tougher for counterfeiters to copy. Among the new security features is a cryptogram, a security code that changes every time the card is used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But retailers, who have a longstanding feud with <span class="companylink">Visa</span> and <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> over fees, are not happy to be bearing the brunt of the costs to install the new chip readers at their stores (some estimate retailers will spend upward of $30 billion over the next few years) to solve what they see as the bank's problem. Moreover, they say they do not know why the financial industry in the United States is largely issuing chip-and-signature cards rather than the safer chip-and-PIN cards that have been widely adopted in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Signature is worthless as a form of authentication'' at the point of sale, Mike Cook, an assistant treasurer and senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, told attendees during an electronic transactions conference in San Francisco this spring. In the cases of the Target and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> breaches, he said, ''not a single PIN debit card needed to be reissued in those breaches. The card number was worthless to the individual thief and fraudsters, because they didn't know the PIN.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The card payment industry argues the new cards will offer better protection against counterfeiting, which they say accounts for the bulk of the fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They also don't want you to have to remember PINs,'' said Mr. Robertson of The Nilson Report. ''The reality of the U.S. market, which is distinct from everywhere else in the world, is that we have an average of 4.5 credit cards per person. That's a lot of PINs to remember.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like a surefire way to get good returns on your money: Invest small amounts across a dozen or more young companies; reap outsize rewards on one or two; repeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the simplified version of angel investing, the euphemistic term given to early stage investments in companies that are long on ideas and short on capital. Before banks will make loans or venture capitalists deem the companies large enough to invest in, angels put up the much-needed seed money to propel companies toward their goal. Or at least that is the hope.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when conventional returns are low, lawyers and financial advisers say clients who wouldn't have thought of angel investing a few years ago are looking at it now. But too often, investors are not doing their due diligence. The idea of angel investing has become too alluring. Think of those early investors who backed <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span> or <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Smart people are doing it because they don't know what they don't know,'' said Daniel L. Gottfried, a partner at the law firm Hinckley Allen. ''When these doctors and lawyers are doing it, they're investing with the hope that they're going to make lots and lots of money. It's roulette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But unlike roulette,'' he said, ''there are things they can do to stack the deck in their own favor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottfried, who has advised angel investors and companies seeking angel investments, said he had become skeptical of the culture of angel investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What bugs me is this whole start-up scene is a lifestyle, and there are these investors who think it's sexy and want to be part of that lifestyle,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why otherwise successful professionals are succumbing to the siren song of mega-returns and blocking out the pitfalls, which are often discussed openly by people who are members of angel investing groups and who have had success with these investments. Considering the pitfalls is one way of minimizing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The percentage of failure to success is very minimal successes,'' said Rick Marcatos, senior vice president at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Wealth Management Americas. ''The current environment we're in, with ample liquidity and low interest rates, has spawned a rush of people with halfhearted business plans who have been able to raise money from unsuspecting investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet like that one low round of golf that is often brought up while all the mediocre ones are not, the success stories are what many wealthy but not necessarily sophisticated investors choose to hear. Can people who don't have all day, every day to look at hundreds of potential deals hope to have success as an angel investor? Maybe. Should they try it? That has a more nuanced answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a sophisticated venture capitalist, you're out looking at hundreds of potential opportunities before making a decision. If you're a professional with a day job, it's not realistic to think you have the time to do that. Picking from just a few may be convenient, but it is not rational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angel investment groups are popular. I've written about their strategies of bringing together investors to pool their capital and their knowledge of different industries. But that, too, is a time commitment some investors cannot make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to find investments where you can use your knowledge as well as your capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brin McCagg, an entrepreneur on his fourth company, has received financing from friends and family, venture capitalists and angel investors. He sought out angel investors with industry knowledge for his current company, RecruitiFi, which brings together companies looking to hire people with executive recruiters who have expertise in finding the right people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm going to people with a great idea and they happen to know the industry,'' Mr. McCagg said. ''They say, 'I think you can execute and I think I can add value. Can I invest?' That's very different than making a half-dozen angel investments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At RecruitiFi, Mr. McCagg brought on the former chief executive of one of the big four recruiting firms to advise the company on the art of recruiting as well as to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. McCagg, despite asking for angel investments, advises people to wait and make sure they have enough money before they make an angel investment. ''You should build a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds and make money, and sooner or later someone is going to come along with a business opportunity in an industry you know,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because some entrepreneurs ask you to invest in their company doesn't mean you should. Flattery, after all, clouds judgment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who is managing the company is as important, if not more important, than the idea itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Usually, it turns out that the greatest idea in the world is not the only greatest idea in the world,'' said Craig Mullett, founder and president of the Branison Group, a corporate finance firm, and an angel investor himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My wife says every time you meet with these people you have to stop saying they're really smart,'' he said. ''That's a truism. They have to be extremely smart, but they also have to have really good business smarts. If they have a strategy but no way they can implement it, then I pass.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he liked to see managers who were careful about how they spent money. He said he also avoided managers enmeshed in complicated family dynamics that could disrupt the running of the company and managers who had grown comfortable with their salary and lost the drive to grow the company so it would benefit investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mullet said he also looked at the expertise of the board members and how they functioned together. One risk is that the company has to bring in a strategic investor who gets a board seat and then essentially takes over the company, often reducing, if not wiping out, early investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's prospects are also helped, he said, if there are some barriers to competition, either in terms of the technology or the relationships the company has built with crucial vendors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspiring angel investors should also try to gauge the time it will take for the company to bring the idea to fruition. When subsequent rounds of financing are needed, the original angel investor will need to put up more money or risk having the investment diluted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Mendelson, who ran the venture capital firm Axiom Ventures and is also an angel investor, said he looked for angel investments that did not need more than one or two rounds of financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they don't get there, you can write off your investment,'' he said. ''If they do get there, you don't have to put up three or four rounds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was always prepared to put in two or three times his original investment to preserve his stake in the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the question of how the investment gets made and what provisions are in the investment documents. Mr. Mullet said he had often made angel investments in the form of convertible debt, not equity. Doing that gives him some of the protection of debt and some of the upside of equity -- if the company doesn't collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more important, he said, he makes sure there is a limit on how much his investment can be diluted. An investment today that is worth 25 percent of the company, for example, could be diluted to 1 percent or less of the company if a larger investor comes in later and there is no cap in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even going through all these checks doesn't guarantee that the investment will pay off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottfried has been on the other side of his advice. He invested in a company that found security holes in networks and automatically patched them. The technology, he said, came from the Israeli military, and the company had been operating for 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything checked out, so he invested. Two years later, the company folded. ''That happens,'' he said. ''But if you do that 10 times, some of them will succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hearing those tales of failures may be the hardest part for amateur investors. After all, a friend of a friend of a friend invested early on in <span class="companylink">Pinterest</span>. ...</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Typically, tech entrepreneurs come up with start-up ideas and bring them to investors for money. A new investment firm in Seattle, backed by from some prominent names in technology and venture capital, plans to come up with start-up ideas on its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm, Pioneer Square Labs, calls itself a ''start-up studio'' and on Thursday announced that it has raised $12.5 million to begin building its fledgling businesses. The money for the Seattle-based firm is coming from more than a dozen other venture capital firms and 50 angel investors, including Bezos Expeditions, the investment firm of Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, and Rich Barton, the founder of Zillow, <span class="companylink">Expedia</span> and other companies.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foundry Group is the venture capital firm leading the investment in Pioneer Square Labs, along with <span class="companylink">Greycroft Partners</span>, <span class="companylink">Madrona Venture Group</span>, Maveron, <span class="companylink">Menlo Ventures</span>, MHS Capital, Sinclair Digital Ventures, Techstars Ventures, Trilogy Equity Partners, <span class="companylink">True Ventures</span>, <span class="companylink">Voyager Capital</span> and Vulcan Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a phone interview, Greg Gottesman, a former venture capitalist with Madrona and one of the founders of Pioneer Square Labs, said the firm would aim for start-up ideas that it can test in the market, most likely ones with a consumer Internet theme. The firm's own partners will further develop the most promising ideas into start-ups, recruit outside talent to run the companies and then help spin them out into independent businesses funded by venture firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottesman said the venture firms investing in Pioneer Square Labs won't be guaranteed a shot at investing in the firm's start-ups, but they will have early knowledge of its activities. ''We're not trying to supplant them in any way,'' said Mr. Gottesman. ''We're trying to be another source of deal flow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are trying a similar approach to making start-ups in-house, including another Seattle firm based in the city's historic Pioneer Square neighborhood, Ivy Softworks. <span class="companylink">Idealab</span>, founded in the mid-1990s in southern California, was one of the earliest tech start-up studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even established venture capital firms dabble in making start-ups in house. While at Madrona, Mr. Gottesman formed an in-house start-up studio called Madrona Venture Labs, where he helped create a start-up called Spare5, which offers a mobile app that lets people earn small amounts of money for manually classifying photographs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other partners at Pioneer Square Labs include Geoff Entress, an angel investor in Seattle; Mike Galgon, who co-founded aQuantive, an Internet advertising firm that <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> acquired for $6 billion in 2007; and Ben Gilbert, a co-founder of Madrona Venture Labs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gottesman said the firm has two start-up ideas it is actively working on at the moment, but it fully expects to end up discarding most of its projects. ''With the labs model, most of these things fail,'' he said. ''We're wrong 80-plus percent of the time. We've only been doing this a month and we've already killed two ideas. It's hard.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the request of officials from the White House Office of Digital Strategy, the crowdfunding website Kickstarter has begun its first social service campaign aimed at raising money for the <span class="companylink">United Nations refugee agency</span> on behalf of Syrian refugees.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors to the site, which is better known for helping inventors and filmmakers, can contribute $15 to buy a sleeping bag, $70 for an emergency rescue kit, or $160, which the site says could pay for a refugee's shelter in a ''well-built group tent, complete with sleeping bag and mat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weeklong campaign, which began Tuesday, had raised more than $550,000 as of that night for a nonprofit organization that supports the <span class="companylink">United Nations refugee agency</span>, an amount the site said had already helped more than 2,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a blog post on the White House website, Joshua Miller, an official in the digital strategy office, wrote that the Kickstarter effort -- along with a similar one with <span class="companylink">Instacart</span>, an online grocery delivery service -- is an effort to follow up on Mr. Obama's plea for Americans to do their part on behalf of the refugees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials said the online fund-raising would not replace the government's efforts or other programs to help manage the refugee crisis. The administration has said it plans to increase by 10,000 the number of Syrian refugees admitted into the United States in the next year and to further expand the number of refugees admitted from other countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has said it will also continue to contribute money to help confront the crisis overseas. Officials said the United States was the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance, having given about $4.5 billion to support those escaping the violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The refugee agency's appeals for money for the Syria crisis have raised less than half what is needed. Appeals for other refugee crises, including those in Darfur and Central African Republic, which receive far less media attention and are not part of the Kickstarter campaign, face a worse predicament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials noted that in 1885, hundreds of thousands of Americans donated small sums to pay for a $2.5 million base for the Statue of Liberty. ''Just like we banded together in 1885, we can join together to provide shelter, food and medical assistance to these people in need,'' Mr. Miller wrote in his blog post. ''It's the American thing to do.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You want to hear a crazy story?'' asked Paige Lipari with a conspiratorial laugh. The 28-year-old rare-books dealer was a day away from opening her Greenpoint, Brooklyn, cookbook emporium and cafe, Archestratus, as she recounted an only-in-New York tale: ''My grandparents owned an Italian grocery in Bushwick, at Troutman Street and Knickerbocker'' -- Lipari and Sons Latticini, which specialized in ricotta and mozzarella in the 1940s and '50s -- ''which is a very hip area now.'' Until recently, she continued, the space had been occupied by a bodega, but about a month ago, as Lipari was stocking more than 4,000 new and used food-focused titles at Archestratus, an hour's walk northwest on Huron Street, a man whom she had seen pass daily with his dog stopped in to welcome her to the neighborhood. He, too, was starting a business -- an artisanal cheese shop in Bushwick. ''So you can see where this is going,'' Lipari said knowingly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> ''He's selling cheese in the exact place where my grandparents sold theirs, and he came in here not knowing anything about that. It was weird.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Archestratus, which opened last week with a Mediterranean-inflected menu of sweet and savory plates, plus small-batch wine, beer and coffee, Lipari recreated her grandmother's airy ricotta to fill cannoli, and a number of other traditional dishes that she discovered while visiting relatives on a summer vacation to Sicily in 2006. ''I returned home really passionate about this food,'' Lipari recalled. ''I feel completely connected to my family when I cook Sicilian.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip to Italy also inspired Lipari, who has worked as a buyer at McNally Jackson, <span class="companylink">Housing Works</span> and a now-closed <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> in Chelsea (''I got my rare-books education at a <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span>, which is kind of ironic,'' she observed), to begin collecting cookbooks. At first, she focused on Sicilian recipes -- usually English translations from the Italian, which were easier to follow than her grandmother's improvised measurements. (That hasn't stopped her, however, from trying to replicate her nonna's broiled eggplant with ammoglio, which Lipari is serving at the cafe atop house-baked sfincione as a modern twist on the Sicilian pizza.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Lipari's library has expanded to include Continental essentials, such as Pellegrino Artusi's 1891 manual ''Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well,'' and stateside staples like Craig Claiborne's 1961 ''<span class="companylink">New York Times</span> Cookbook,'' both for sale at Archestratus, and selections guided in part by her discovery of ''The Life of Luxury,'' the 330 B.C. manifesto on gastronomy penned by the shop's namesake, a Greek poet and philosopher considered the forefather of food writing. ''A lot of his advice back then is what we're all talking about now,'' Lipari said, ''that you should keep things very simple, source the best ingredients and let them shine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archestratus is open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, at 160 Huron Street, Brooklyn, archestrat.us.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiegogo is intensifying its efforts to become the go-to site for personal and nonprofit crowdfunding campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the crowdfunding site introduced Generosity.com, an expanded version of the Indiegogo Life site it created last year for personal fund-raising appeals.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new platform is designed to be a cheaper alternative to traditional crowdfunding sites, including its parent. Indiegogo levies a 5 percent platform fee on money raised through its site, a 3 percent payment processing charge and 30 cents per donation. Generosity.com, like Indiegogo Life, has no platform fee, but processing charges will be deducted before funds are disbursed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slava Rubin, Indiegogo's co-founder and chief executive, said the main difference between Generosity.com and its predecessor was that all nonprofit campaigns would now be hosted on the site. ''They'll no longer pay any fees, which is a very big change,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal crowdfunding sites are a popular choice for campaigns intended to fund medical costs, memorials, educational projects and other charitably minded giving. The biggest site is GoFundMe, which said in September that it had processed donations totaling $1 billion over the previous 12 months. In the United States, GoFundMe charges fees of 7.9 percent and 30 cents per donation for its platform and payment processing costs. (The site's international rates vary, and charities pay slightly higher fees.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiegogo declined to break out donation statistics for Indiegogo Life. As a whole, the company said that its campaigns had raised $750 million since the site was founded in 2008. Other crowdfunding sites include YouCaring, <span class="companylink">GiveForward</span> and Fundly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indiegogo's main site -- like Kickstarter, its top rival -- facilitates fund-raising for creative and entrepreneurial projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The line between those and the kinds of cause-based campaigns that Generosity.com is designed for can sometimes be fuzzy, but Mr. Rubin said he was confident that campaign organizers would choose the right site for their endeavor. Indiegogo has more robust tools for campaign marketing and tracking, while Generosity.com's interface is stripped-down and simpler, he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs raising money through crowdfunding campaigns have typically rewarded their backers with early access to products and with tchotchkes like T-shirts and coffee mugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But under new rules adopted Friday by the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, they will be able to offer a prize that could be more lucrative: an equity stake in their business.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules will allow small investors to buy shares of private companies under the provisions of the Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act. Until the change, equity crowdfunding had been legal only for accredited investors, or those who met required levels of assets and income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama called the bill, better known as the JOBS Act, ''a potential game-changer'' for fledgling companies, when he signed it more than three years ago. But the law stalled as regulators struggled to write rules stringent enough to protect investors but flexible enough to allow for meaningful fund-raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A set of draft rules released two years ago was widely criticized and deemed almost unworkable by many in the industry, who said that compliance would be too costly and complex. The rules adopted Friday had been substantially revised to address some of those concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules allow companies to raise up to $1 million in a 12-month period through a crowdfunding campaign. Companies will need to provide their potential investors with financial statements, but some first-time issuers and those seeking less than $500,000 will not be required to have the statements audited -- an important concession for those concerned about the cost of providing audited financials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies will be able to advertise their offerings in a variety of ways, including posting them on Kickstarter-like portals for investors to peruse. (Kickstarter has said that it is not interested in expanding into equity crowdfunding, though one of its top rivals, Indiegogo, said it is considering doing so.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of investment portals have sprung up in recent years, but until now, only accredited investors -- those with an annual income exceeding $200,000 or a net worth of at least $1 million -- have been permitted to invest in most of the deals advertised on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those portals now plan to expand into the nonaccredited market. SeedInvest, a site that has helped 50 funding deals in the last three years, expects to begin offering deals next year to a wider pool of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no question that there's a lot of pent-up demand from ordinary investors,'' said Ryan Feit, the site's chief executive and one of its founders. ''At the end of the day, that means there will be more capital available for small business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of money backers will be allowed to invest depends on their income. Those with an annual income or net worth of less than $100,000 will be allowed to invest up to $2,000 in a 12-month period, or 5 percent of the lesser of their income or net worth, whichever is greater. Those with an income and net worth of more than $100,000 will be permitted to invest up to 10 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equity shares they buy will be risky, illiquid investments. Investors will generally be required to hold on to the shares for at least one year, and there are not yet many marketplaces for those seeking to sell shares in private companies, which are difficult to value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics are deeply skeptical about the quality of the investments that will be available. ''Ninety-nine percent of these deals will prove to be unprofitable,'' said Andrew Stoltmann, a lawyer who specializes in securities fraud. ''This is a disaster waiting to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others counter that the new rules will allow entrepreneurs' family, friends, customers and professional contacts to invest in ventures that they want to support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's going to really make a difference for businesses that are not especially fashionable for professional investors,'' said James Dowd, the chief executive of North Capital Private Securities, a broker-dealer that focuses on private fund-raising. ''They want to invest in companies that have the potential to be disruptive to an entire industry. You don't see a lot of capital flow into ordinary consumer and retail businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C. on Friday also proposed changes to several other fund-raising rules, including those governing intrastate offerings. More than 25 states have adopted their own crowdfunding rules to let local businesses raise money from residents within the state, often with fewer regulatory requirements than the federal rules. The commission suggested striking down a rule that blocked those intrastate offerings from being advertised to out-of-state investors -- a quirk that prevented companies from publicizing their fund-raising campaigns on their own websites or on social media sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an absurd thing, but that's what the law said. It was horrifying,'' said Kendall Almerico, a lawyer who specializes in crowdfunding issues. ''Fixing this is huge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The range of ways in which private companies can raise money from nonaccredited investors has significantly expanded this year. In June, new federal rules took effect allowing companies to raise up to $50 million through a provision known as Regulation A. Those deals carry stricter disclosure and compliance requirements than the crowdfunding process outlined on Friday, which is intended to be much cheaper and faster for issuers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the new federal and state rules give entrepreneurs a much wider set of options for raising money from a diverse pool of investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm surprised at how far the S.E.C. went to make it all work,'' said Douglas S. Ellenoff, a securities lawyer at <span class="companylink">Ellenoff Grossman &amp; Schole</span>. ''The entrepreneur now has a series of very interesting choices and lots of different options for how they go about their capital formation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.E.C.'s four commissioners voted 3-1 on Friday morning to adopt the new crowdfunding rules, which are expected to take effect early next year.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to start a family,'' says Sarah Soller-Mihlek, a Brooklyn guitar instructor, speaking into a camera. ''We've always dreamed of becoming parents,'' adds her wife, Jill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple made the video last year and posted it to Indiegogo, a crowdfunding website, in hopes of raising enough money to pay for fertility treatments. Jill Soller-Mihlek, now 33, was hoping to get pregnant via a sperm donor and intrauterine insemination, which can costs tens of thousands of dollars depending on how long it takes to conceive.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the couple's insurance plan typically covers fertility treatment, their insurer, UnitedHealthcare, would not cover the cost. The reason? Jill Soller-Mihlek didn't meet its definition of infertility because she did not have sex with men.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's insurance policy defines infertility as an ''inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of unprotected heterosexual intercourse.'' But women who use sperm donors must pay for costly, physician-supervised therapeutic donor insemination for 12 months before they meet the definition of infertility. (Women 35 and older need to go through six failed attempts before meeting the clinical definition of infertility.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Soller-Mihleks paid $13,507 out of pocket for nine unsuccessful cycles of insemination, they decided to chronicle their travails on Indiegogo and <span class="companylink">Change.org</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the UnitedHealthcare policy tacitly acknowledges single women and same-sex couples, many policies do not. Some even exclude unwed women. Notably, major insurers like UnitedHealthcare often do cover insemination treatments when the issue is male infertility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soller-Mihleks believe their plan's criteria for granting medical coverage of fertility treatment reveals a subtle form of discrimination against lesbians. (Needless to say, gay men face even greater obstacles in attempting to gain coverage, given that coverage wouldn't extend to the woman who'd be carrying for them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Soller-Mihleks say their concern is that a lesbian, by definition, is incapable of getting pregnant through heterosexual intercourse and requires medical intervention to conceive. They say the subtext of the UnitedHealthcare policy is that a lesbian could get pregnant by having sex with a man, she just chooses not to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shannon Price Minter, head of the legal division at the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, said: ''To me, the central injustice is that when a person has a known condition that precludes them from becoming pregnant, such as a woman who has had her ovaries removed, there is no requirement to go through a period of unprotected intercourse before being recognized as requiring fertility treatments. The same should be true for same-sex couples.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyler Mason, a spokesman for UnitedHealthcare, said the company's policy is based on the clinical disease of infertility, as defined by the <span class="companylink">American Society of Reproductive Medicine</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our coverage criteria are based on clinical trial data, published literature and recommendations from a wide variety of medical specialty societies and state laws,'' Mr. Mason wrote in a statement. ''We constantly review and update coverage criteria.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Aetna</span> also uses the clinical definition of infertility to support its reimbursement policies for fertility treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a pregnancy benefit,'' said Cynthia B. Michener, an Aetna spokeswoman. ''It's based on the clinical disease of infertility, supported by medical evidence and medical society guidelines, including those set out by the A.S.R.M., and it's the same for everyone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some experts say the policies are discriminatory. Dr. Paula Amato, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, sits on the ethics committee of the reproductive medicine society, says it may not be fair to use the clinical definition of infertility in the case of same-sex couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my opinion, it's unfair because they are treating same-sex couples differently from heterosexual couples,'' Dr. Amato said. ''Same-sex couples have to pay for the 12 or six months of trying on their own. The insurance companies are making a distinction between what they would call 'medical infertility' and 'a medical problem for lack of a male partner,' and I would argue that 'lack of a male partner' should be enough to justify an indication for medical treatment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, many heterosexual couples are also forced to endure the heavy financial burden of fertility treatment because their insurance companies won't pay for it. Only 15 states, including New York, California, Illinois and Texas, mandate some form of fertility coverage, and many insurance companies don't cover any fertility treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the U.S., about 85 percent of all infertility care is paid out of pocket,'' said Judith F. Daar, a professor of law at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif., and chairwoman of the reproductive medicine society's ethics committee. ''And only about 50 percent of all people who experience infertility actually visit professionals to follow up, because of the financial stranglehold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer C. Pizer, the law and policy project director for Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy organization, said that it was not clear whether gay couples could win a legal challenge against insurance companies, but that a double standard of reimbursement for straight and same-sex couples smacked of discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do think it's sex or sexual orientation discrimination to treat a man with a female partner and a very low or absent sperm count differently than a lesbian with a female partner and nonexistent sperm count,'' Ms. Pizer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After completing 12 unsuccessful months of intrauterine insemination, or IUI, Jill Soller-Mihlek asked UnitedHealthcare to begin reimbursing the costs of her treatment. As it happened, a clerical error resulted in reimbursement for one treatment, but the larger request for coverage was denied on different grounds. Because Ms. Soller-Mihlek had tried 12 times to conceive using the IUI method, the insurer declined to cover more IUIs, saying she was now a medical candidate for in vitro fertilization, or IVF, a fertility treatment the policy didn't cover under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Soller-Mihlek said the policy created a Catch-22 for lesbian couples and single women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Twelve months of sex with one's husband will make you eligible for coverage, but 12 months of IUIs makes you a lost cause,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending $22,000 on treatments, she sought additional medical advice on the possible reasons for her infertility. She received a diagnosis of endometriosis, a painful disorder in which the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside it, and was thus eligible for insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the insurance company finally covering the costs, Ms. Soller-Mihlek underwent a 13th round of IUI treatment. This time it was a success, and she is now 18 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As happy as we are with our growing bump,'' she said, ''it won't be a complete success story until we know that no more families have to go through what we did to get here.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Silicon Valley start-ups that often grab headlines are typically in the Internet and consumer technology world. But there's another part of start-up land that is also highly active: health-related technology, which includes biotech, health care services and medical devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists have been pouring money into health-related start-ups, with funding jumping 34 percent to $9.4 billion in 2014 from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Venture Capital Association</span>. What's often left unsaid about these companies is that they behave very differently from the typical consumer start-up or business software company.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health-related start-up sector has produced fewer unicorns, which are the private companies with $1 billion-plus valuations, largely because it takes a long time to develop new medical tests, drugs or insurance systems. Regulators often weigh in. Even if an idea behind a start-up is truly great, it's bound to fail if the science doesn't work out, if the regulators don't like what they see, or if insurers and the government won't pay for the product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryan Roberts, a partner at the venture capital firm Venrock, knows the risks. He has been investing in health tech companies since 1997 and has put money into seven unicorn companies, including Illumina, <span class="companylink">Athenahealth</span> and Intarcia Therapeutics. He also led the investment in the health care software company <span class="companylink">Castlight Health</span>, which has seen its stock price fall by half since its initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roberts explained in an interview what makes the health tech space treacherous for investors, including the dangers of investing in a good story rather than in good science. Among the companies he discussed was Theranos, the blood-testing start-up valued at around $9 billion by investors, which recently made waves after a Wall Street Journal investigation raised questions about its technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interview was edited for clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care-related start-ups usually attract specialist venture investors rather than generalists. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Software and services companies that focus on improving health care costs and outcomes used to attract specialists because they were in a small, unloved space. These companies have historically been treacherous for a few reasons. The customers have no money. The people who pay for care are different than the people who get that care, so incentives aren't aligned. The providers have no idea how much things cost. And there was historically not much technology adoption in the space. But that's changing thanks to new regulations, changes to payment models and more technology adoption. More technology entrepreneurs and investors are going into the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biotech and diagnostics companies continue to attract specialists because they depend on very technical evaluations like clinical trial success or failure. It's also a large enough market to support specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are a proponent of start-ups in health care-related industries having industry experts on their boards. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally speaking, the entrepreneurs are trying something new, innovative and risky. You need people who can push and prod on the founder because, at the end of the day, the company needs to integrate their totally new approach with cleareyed realism about the industry they're trying to change. That realism comes from industry experience. I think that a leading indicator of success is how a company integrates those two things</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theranos has recently been in the news. What are your thoughts on the start-up? (Mr. Roberts was not approached to invest, nor did he look to invest, in Theranos.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was skeptical. The industry that Theranos is a part of has been commoditized. Those blood tests are run millions of times a year by two entrenched players, <span class="companylink">Laboratory Corporation of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Quest Diagnostics</span>, that have only single-digit net margins. So I didn't want to be in at any price, especially at a $9 billion valuation. The company would need $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue just for me to break even on my investment. I don't want to break even. No one wants to break even. I want to make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you build a start-up that competes against entrenched competitors based largely on price, that's a hard business for anyone. The problem with competing on price is that entrenched competitors are willing to lose money to put someone out of business and get rid of them. You want to enable something totally new. I didn't think Theranos was something new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What role does data play in these types of companies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially in biotech and diagnostics companies, you have to follow the scientific axiom of trust the data and nothing else. No company, whether it's Theranos or anyone else, will escape that truth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most companies present or publish data in parallel to the <span class="companylink">Food and Drug Administration</span> process because the F.D.A.'s review is often not public. If you get approval, you still want your analysis and data to be public because the F.D.A. hurdles for acceptance are different depending on whether you're a therapeutic, a medical device or a diagnostic company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadly speaking, medical professionals place peer-reviewed literature in high regard. And as an investor, I want to read things that show that a new product to be a substantial improvement over what is already happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a takeaway from the Theranos situation for investors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I look at the puzzle pieces around the Theranos experience and I'm reminded of the danger of the echo chamber.

Welcome to the Republican presidential debate here on the Fox Business Network . I'm Neil Cavuto, alongside my co- moderators, Maria Bartiromo, and the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, Gerard Baker .</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Tonight we're partnering with the Wall Street Journal to ask questions on the economy that voters want answered. We're also working with <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> , who tells us that since the first Republican debate, more than 58 million people have joined the political conversation online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 9 million are talking specifically about the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: The candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls. Those standings determining their position on the stage. And here they are. At center stage, businessman Donald Trump .</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Tonight's rules are simple. Up to 90 second for each answer. One minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you'll here this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: It sounds like a game show but it's not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room, and I'm not talking about your party's fine symbol. I'm talking about the purpose of tonight's debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy and what each of you would do to improve it. No more, no less. We are focused on those issues, and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words. That is the agenda tonight. How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow. And so we begin. Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well. They're demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Just a few hours ago, near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: I can't be Neil. And the and the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don't win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It's going to be a tremendous plan. I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can't do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: So do not raise the minimum wage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: I would not do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Dr. Carson, you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery. And this <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> map show Americans share your concern. The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation, especially here in the state of Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You suggested one minimum wage does not fit all, and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people. Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less. Where are you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: Well, first of all, delighted to be here. My family's here, and my little granddaughter, who's three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate. So this is very cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's particularly a problem in the black community. Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. You know, that -- and that's because of those high wages. If you lower those wages, that comes down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know, I can remember, as a youngster -- you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs. But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual. And that's what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what we need to be thinking about. How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: So, sir, just to be clear, you would not raise it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: I would not raise it. I would not raise it, specifically because I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways, including free health care, free college and a host of other government-paid benefits. Since you aren't a fan of all they're giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related. As I've said many times before, my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: We call that the American dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn't. In the 20th century, it's a disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we do that -- and if we do this -- if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator Rubio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: We've asked people on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to submit their questions for the candidates. Seth Bell wrote, ''We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?'' Governor Kasich, you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton. Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably. Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years. Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency. With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: First of all, let me just say that, in the state of Ohio -- and I'm the only acting executive on -- on this stage today -- we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage. And I got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. He died of black lung. He was losing his eyesight. My mother's mother lived with us. She could barely speak English. I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work. An economic theory is fine, but you know what? People need help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt. I have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan -- the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them. Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, lower taxes, lower spending. My website, JohnKasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect, and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason. When you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their God-given potential. That's why it's so important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. But to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and I will do it for America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Did you want to name any specific steps, sir?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Sure. We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth. And I have a whole series of ways to do that. In Ohio, we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn't cut one benefit or didn't take anybody off the rolls. Why? Because we're innovators. I've been an innovator my entire career. And I really don't care what special interests or lobbyists have to say. I have a job to do when I take over a public office. Now, we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years. We also put an increase in defense spending. Our tax cuts balance out. And at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I want everybody here to know, when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington, I stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth. And as governor of Ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: I'll do it in Washington. I've done it twice; I'll do it thrice for the United States of America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> recently cut its expectations for economic growth. Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing. The next president will have to deal with it. You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion. You're calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax. What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUZ: Well, Maria, it's great to be with you. It's great to be here in Milwaukee. You know, the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have -- face, which is, how do we get the economy growing? How do we bring back economic growth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have. As you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. The Obama economy is a disaster, and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal. It doesn't have to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you look at the history of America, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. The first is tax reform. And as you noted, I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the third element is sound money. Every time we've pursued all three of those -- whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan -- the result has been incredible economic growth. We have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Excuse me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Governor Bush...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Yeah, I would like to make a comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: You've already made two comments, John. It's my turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich, coming up. We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: I got about four minutes in the last debate. I'm going to get my question right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: I appreciate it, Jeb. I'm all of you. But I want at some point to talk about a value-added tax and $11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point. So I would like to talk about it at some point, because that's what leadership is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: We will -- we will certainly get to that. Governor Bush?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Almost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking. Many have given up. That's what the participation rate tells us. You've said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth, which we haven't seen since the year 2000. What specific regulations would you change? And how will that lead to jobs and growth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: First of all, we could get to 4 percent growth. The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don't have makes -- makes the deficit grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. And the proposal that I've laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. We cut the -- we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above -- below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing. It would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higher-wage jobs, and so that's part of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And start over. For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clean power act, we ought to repeal that and -- and start over on that. The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that. We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: And if we're serious about being serious about high growth, then we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than -- than are -- than are being set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama's policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now aren't working or have given up altogether, as you said. That's not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. That's not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it's not the best America can do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Ms. Fiorina, while you've all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president's jobs performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month. Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month. Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month. If you win the nomination, you'll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIORINA: Well, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day. I would guess she was 40 years old. She had several children. And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my children's future. And that really struck me. This is America. A mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time. Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats. But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. This isn't about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now. It's about actually challenging the status quo of big government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big government has created a big business called politics. And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics. Specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again. We need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to actually reform the tax code. Go to a three-page tax code. Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages. In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books. That hasn't been done in 50 years. We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one. We've become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance. All this has to be done, and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done. We must take our government back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States. Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers. Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker. Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Absolutely. And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst. It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats. So the thing is, let's look for root causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I would also say -- lay some blame at the -- the feet of the Federal Reserve . I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse. By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. They're actually talking now about negative interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York. And because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. So what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So really we need to reexamine whether we not -- we want a Federal Reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates. We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Thank you, Senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: All right. We're only just getting started. Coming up, your taxes. Stick around. You're watching FOX Business</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Welcome back to the Milwaukee Theater and the Republican presidential debate. Let's get right back to our questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Carson, to you. You recently railed against the double- standard in the media, sir, that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to then-Senator Barack Obama's. Still, as a candidate whose brand has always been trust, are you worried your campaign -- which you've always said, sir, is bigger than you -- is now being hurt by you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: Well, first of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration's plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally. The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy, what will you do about it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down. That was an unbelievable decision.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we don't have enough of those decisions coming down. He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders. That was a great day. And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration. It's hurting us economically. It's hurting us from every standpoint. It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it really is -- was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1 decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I will tell you, we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be successful. And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Can we comment on that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Yes, one quick comment, yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Well, look, in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here, if they were law-abiding, could stay. But, what didn't happen is we didn't build the walls effectively and we didn't control the border. We need to. We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico -- to Mexico, think about the families. Think about the children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, you know what the answer really is? If they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty. They get to stay. We protect the wall. Anybody else comes over, they go back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the 11 million people, come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border. It's a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ohio is diversified. And little false little things, sir, they don't really work when it comes to the truth.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me -- let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country. The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology. Americans are anxious that the new economy isn't producing higher-paying jobs. Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away. How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: Well, you know, that's an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn. We are living through a massive economic transformation. I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it isn't just a different economy. It's changing faster than ever. You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that. There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we're not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our higher education system is completely outdated. It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn't teach 21st century skills. If we do what needs to be done -- tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. And we won't just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And then truly this new century can be a new American century.</p>

Many are opting to pay the fine. Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether. What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business?</p>

As government gets bigger, and bigger -- and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike -- and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, we have to repeal it. It's tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests. Then, we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool. We need to try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MUSIC)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee. Let's get back to the questions. And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year, taxes. And this will go to several of you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes. <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> data certainly backs that up. Once again the green on this map that we're going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation, especially here in Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First off, Dr. Carson, to you. You say you are in favor of a tax system, I guess akin to tithing, sir, with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said, if everybody pays this, I think God is a pretty fair guy, so tithing is a pretty fair process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Donald Trump says that is not fair. That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it's a fair thing to do. So whose plan would God endorse then, Doctor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yours or Mr. Trump's?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: Well, you know, when I say tithing, I'm talking about the concept of proportionality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: Everybody should pay the same proportion of what they make. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. You get same rights and privileges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that. But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another. And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction. But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they say there will be no more charitable giving. We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that. The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in people's pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous. And it's...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">... the money that they earned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people. And in the system that we're putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level. But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the land of dreams. And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Paul, you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an across-the-board 14.5 percent fair and flat tax. You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that's the idea. You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don't you risk, sir, creating a near-term budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Well, it's a great question, Neil, and thanks for including me in the tax debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think what's important about the tax debate is, is that we have to ask the question, where is money best spent, in the private sector or in the government sector? I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it. So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My tax plan, however, is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan. I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five-year period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut. The question came up earlier, where would you cut? Nobody likes to say where they would cut. I've put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we'd just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years. So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: What is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax. Democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's proportionality, as Ben is trying to explain to folks. But the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut. And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: There are no deductions on your -- under your plan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Ours is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals. No payroll tax for the employee. The business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions -- home mortgage and charity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Thank you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, there isn't anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes. Most people just want a fair shake, and they don't want their money to be wasted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But explain how your plan works. How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUZ: Well, sure, you put your finger on what the problem is. The current system isn't fair. Washington is fundamentally corrupt. There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible -- and -- and not a one of them is as good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every one of them reflects a carve-out or a subsidy, and it's all about empowering the Washington cartel. My simple Flat Tax says that, for a family of four, for the first $36,000 you earn, you pay no taxes whatsoever. No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above that, every American pays 10 percent across the board -- a flat, fair tax. Which means that no longer do you have hedge-fund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the business side, I've got a business flat tax of 16 percent -- again, that applies across the board. Right now, with our corporate income tax, giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is fair and across-the-board. Now, you ask, how do the numbers add up? I would encourage folks, if you go to our website, tedcruz.org, we have the specific numbers on the website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, eliminates the corporate income tax, and it abolishes the IRS .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the effect of that is incredible economic growth. It means every income group will see double-digit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if you're a single mom, if you're making $40,000 a year, what that means is an extra about $5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids, to make ends meet. It has a powerful, powerful effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's one other really powerful feature of my plan, which is that it's border-adjustable. Which means, if you're an exporter -- if you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you're a manufacturer, you don't pay the businesses flat tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports are free of that tax, but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax, which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom, and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: But you haven't told us how to pay for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUZ: Well, the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which -- which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is less than a trillion. It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it's one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan. $500 billion in specific cuts -- five major agencies that I would eliminate. The IRS , the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and HUD -- and then 25 specific programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Again, that's on our website at tedcruz.org. You want to look at specificity? It's easy for everyone to say, ''cut spending''. It's much harder and riskier to put out, chapter and verse, specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Bush, Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration. But, Governor Bush, how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda? Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: I'm gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country. Of course it's the highest priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we don't do that, we're stuck with the ''new normal'' of 2 percent growth. Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it. Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It means -- it means more demands on government -- growing the economy is the first job, if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. And more importantly, people are really struggling right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks. So yeah, we've created jobs, your -- argue (ph) -- brought that up early, and it was a good question. Jobs are being created, but they're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy. I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph), who are supporters of mine. Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard, he is -- he's in Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reagan Love -- by the way, pretty great name, I think -- is a teacher. When -- if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket -- they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite. We would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things -- make things better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillary Clinton's approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Senator Rubio, your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for low-income parents. A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't -- isn't there a risk you're just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: The most important job I'm ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent. Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic), because the most important institution in society is the family. If the family breaks down, society breaks down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can't have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more. In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I'm talking about. They don't know how they're going to make that payment every month, and if they can't make it, they can't work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. They don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future, to go to college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I'm proud of it. I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the -- in the country, the family.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We're not talking about giving people back their tax money. He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. It's a welfare transfer payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here's what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments -- a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative. Thank you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone pays payroll tax. This is their money. This is not our money. And here's what I don't understand -- if you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we're not going to recognize that in our tax code? The family is the most important institution in society. And, yes...</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: ...Yes...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: ...the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific. You've said that you'd rather have no deal...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: ...Yeah...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: ...than sign the one that's on the table...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: ...It's a horrible deal...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: ...Most economists -- most economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents. Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: The TPP is horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. It's 5,600 pages long. So complex that nobodies read it. It's like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is one of the worst trade deals. And I would, yes, rather not have it. With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, I'd rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better. We lose a fortune on trade. The United States loses with everybody. We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan. By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I must say, Gerard, I just think it's a terrible deal. I love trade. I'm a free trader, 100 percent. But we need smart people making the deals, and we don't have smart people making the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: The -- the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published -- were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and these -- the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent. Which -- are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: Yes. Well, the currency manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster. If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States -- China in particular, because they're so good. It's the number-one abuser of this country. And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement. It's not even discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: There was a separate -- separate...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have. They don't even discuss it in this agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I say, it's a very bad deal, should not be approved. If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country. We are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before. I want to bring jobs back into this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Hey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(UNKNOWN): True. It's true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: That's right. That's right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Before we get a little bit off-kilter here...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: But isn't that -- isn't that part of the problem? When I say, Senator, that if -- if this deal is not ratified by -- by the U.S. -- by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it's been seeking to do? And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead? PAUL: There is an argument that China doesn't like the deal, because in us doing the deal, we'll be trading with their competitors. You're exactly right. But I think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an important point, though, about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on. We should negotiate from a position of strength. And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us. I think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals. We give up the power to filibuster, and I'm kind of fond of that power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We give up the power to amend. And I think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch. Really, Congress is kind of a bystander. We don't write the rules. We don't make the laws. The executive branch does. So even in trade -- and I am for trade -- I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, back to the questions. Americans face security threats at home and abroad. Last year, terrorist attacks rose 61 percent, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, with the most deaths occurring in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president's decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they -- that's why they're called special ops, they're actually able to guide some of the other things that we're doing there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also must recognize that it's a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we've been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can't give up ground right there. But we have to look at this on a much more global scale. We're talking about global jihadists. And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers? Because that's the way that they're able to gather a lot of influence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate. And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if -- outside of Anbar in Iraq, there's a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I've learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BARTIROMO: We asked <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> to take a look at some of the major issues we're talking about, and tackling in this debate tonight. This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most. The bigger the word, the more the talk. One of the most discussed issues in the last month, homeland security. Governor Bush, what is the biggest threat facing America today?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: It is -- I'd say it is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled. That's the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We should have a no fly zone in Syria. We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army, and create safe zones. If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there, then we 'ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe. And, that requires American leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities. It is tragic that you see Iraq, and other countries now talking to Russia. It wasn't that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all. And, so, the United States needs to lead across the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This president, and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play, and we're now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don't deal with this.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRUMP: Well, first of all, it's not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that's one of the worst deals ever made. One of the worst contracts ever signed, ever, in anything, and it's a disgrace.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's how ISIS grew. We pushed back Assad, and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum. So the first thing you do is don't arm your enemies. (CROSSTALK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: I need to add a couple of points to this. The first is, I've never met Vladimir Putin , but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He understands only geopolitical strength. And every time he has acted anywhere in the world, whether it's in Ukraine or Georgia before that, or now in the Middle East, it's because he is trusting in weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done, which is nothing, the president has no strategy, our allies in the region do not trust us. For goodness sake, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran. And so our allies in the region don't trust us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And here's why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya. They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon they will be in Turkey. They will try Jordan. They will try Saudi Arabia. They are coming to us. They recruit Americans using social media.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Thank you, Senator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet state-backed Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion. And as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Would you stop them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Let me tell you this, Mr. Baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to give you a little trip around the world. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. In the Ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. In the eastern part of Europe, make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move, we move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the Turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the Jordanian border. Anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. They fly in there a second time, they will not fly out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we're still involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saudi Arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. But they're fundamentally our friends. Jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. Egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the groups -- in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain, the <span class="companylink">Cleveland Clinic</span> is opening an operation. Clearly we see the same with them. And in Israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally China, China doesn't own the South China Sea, and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the trade agreement, the TPP, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese. They are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, I will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. When the fall comes, and we run against Hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. I have two 16-year-old girls, and I want this country to be strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and we got the budget balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Ohio, as the CEO, and guess what, we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall. And our ideas have to add up. They have to be solid. And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: All right. And look at the time, look at the time. You are watching FOX Business, we'll take a break. Stick around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now let's get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn't bail out the banks. Would you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: We're not -- we shouldn't have another financial crisis. What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren't too big to fail. Dodd-Frank has actually done the opposite, totally the opposite, where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren't high enough. If we were serious about it, we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions. This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country, and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is. It was -- get the -- kind of the -- anyway. We had...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It -- and I talked to a banker there. This is a bank that had $125 million of assets, four branches. Their compliance costs because of Dodd-Frank went from $100,000 to $600,000 in a two-year period. The net effect of that is -- and they had -- they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis. They knew -- they knew their borrowers. They gave back to the community. They were engaged in the community. And imagine America without its community banks. Well, that's what's happening because of Dodd-Frank. That's -- that's my worry. My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that. She wants to create even more so. She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is -- she was for the trade agreement in -- the Pacific agreement. Now she's against it. She was -- hinted she was for the XL pipeline. Now she's opposed to it. All the things that would create sustained economic growth she's now doubling down against it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: But, Governor, but can I just quickly -- did -- you can't seriously guarantee that there won't be another financial crisis, can you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: You could, if you were serious about...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Ever? There will never be another financial crisis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUSH: No, I can't say that. But I can say, if you created higher capital requirements, that's the solution to this, not having concentration of assets. The bigger banks now have more and more control over -- over the financial assets of this country. And that is the wrong approach to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Dr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever. Asset held by <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> , for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion. Do you think <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and the other big banks should be broken up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: Well, I think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. This country was -- declared its independence in 1776. In less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. Those are the fuels that drive it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. If we can get that out, it makes a big difference. And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. And it's shifted to the individual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So -- and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. It is hurting the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core. They'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help. You can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having. We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: But just to be clear, just -- just to be clear, then, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't favor breaking up the big banks? You think they're big enough -- they're OK as they are, as big as they are?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CARSON: I would have policies that wouldn't allow that to occur. I don't want to go in and tear anybody down. I mean, that doesn't help us. But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: Can I just add what -- he's right on point there. Do you know why these banks are so big? The government made them big. The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations. So the big banks, they have an army of lawyers, they have an army of compliance officers. They can deal with all these things. The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they can't deal with all these regulations. They can't deal with all -- they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations. And so the result is, the big banks get bigger, the small banks struggle to lend or even exist, and the result is what you have today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Dodd-Frank, you have actually codified too big to fail. We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions, and these banks go around bragging about it. You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod? We are so big, we are so important that if we get in trouble, the government has to bail us out. This is an outrage. We need to repeal Dodd-Frank as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Let me -- let me also say, Gary -- Gary, let me also say, Jeb is -- what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital, people who invest it and they hold their capital, so that if the bank goes down, the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay. That's what he's trying to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secondly, I'll tell you about Wall Street: There's too much greed. And the fact is, a free enterprise system is a system that's produced the greatest wealth for the world. But you know Michael Novak, the great Catholic theologian, says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values -- and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives -- yes, free enterprise is great, profits are great, but there have to be some values that underlay it, and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BAKER: Thank you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: Gerard, can I comment...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Senator Cruz -- and I will get to you -- but, Senator Cruz, on that theme, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> data shows that over the last month alone, nearly 1 million people -- nearly 1 million -- have been concerned about reining in Wall Street, apparently believing that some have not been punished enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general, would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored, in other words, the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUZ: Absolutely yes. You know, I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution. And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know, the opening question Jerry asked, would you bail out the big banks again? Nobody gave you an answer to that. I'll give you an answer. Absolutely not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what we have right now is we have Washington -- as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich. The truth is, the rich do great with big government. They get in bed with big government. The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under Dodd-Frank and community banks are going out of business. And, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can't get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism. Some weeks ago, a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate. Sabina Loving is an African-American single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago. She found a store front, she wanted to have her own business. She started a business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. They did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the Dead Horse Act. Now, this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but Sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee. It would have driven her out of business, and Ms. Loving sued the IRS . She took the Obama IRS to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Senator...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Senator, I really want to be clear here. Are you saying, sir, that if <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> were on the brink, you would let it fail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUZ: Yes. Now, let's be clear, there is a role for the Federal Reserve -- what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher- kings trying to guess what's happening with the economy. You look at the Fed, one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s, we had loose money, we had an asset bubble, it drove up the price of real estate, drove up the price of commodities, and then in the third quarter of 2008, the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices, which caused a cascading collapse. That's why I am supporting getting back to rules-based monetary system not with a bunch of philosopher-kings deciding, but tied...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVUTO: Sir, I understand that. I just want to be clear, if you don't mind, that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision. And I just want to be clear. If it were to happen again, for whatever the reason, you would let it go, you would let a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUZ: So let me be clear. I would not bail them out, but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, number one, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold, and, number two, serving as a lender of last resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what central banks do. So if you have a run on the bank, the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort, but it's not a bailout. It is a loan at higher interest rates. That's how central banks have worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I'll point out -- look, we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods, we had it for about 170 years of our nation's history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We need to get back to sound money, which helps, in particular, working men and women. What Washington does -- the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government. The people who (inaudible) working men and women...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(CROSSTALK)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KASICH: Neil, that's the difference of being an executive. And let me just explain: when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don't say we believe in philosophical concerns. You know what an executive has to decide? When there's a water crisis, how do we get water to the city? When there's a school shooting, how do you get there and help heal a community? When there are financial crisis, or a crisis with ebola, you got to go there and try to fix it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My argument is, going forward, the banks have to reserve the capital, so that the -- so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches, Ted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIORINA: Can I just -- could I just say, as a chief executive who's had to make tough calls to save jobs and to grow jobs, I think what's interesting about Dodd-Frank is it's a great example of how socialism starts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government created the problem of a real estate boom. How did we create it? Under Republican and Democrats alike, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, everybody gathered together, Republicans and Democrats, and said, ''home ownership is part of the American dream. Let's create a bubble,'' and then government stepped in -- by the way, under president George W. Bush, banks were told -- encouraged -- told, really -- to buy other banks, to take money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now what do we have with Dodd-Frank? The classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Production Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Rubio, Hillary Clinton is the clear front runner for the Democratic nomination. If she is indeed the nominee, you will be facing a candidate with an impressive resume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was the first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state under Barack Obama. She has arguably more experience, certainly more time in government than almost all of you on stage tonight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should the American people trust you to lead this country, even though she has been so much closer to the office?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RUBIO: Well, that's a great question, and let me begin by answering it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century. This next (ph) election is actually a generational choice. A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For over 2.5 centuries, America's been a special country, the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything, a nation that's been a force for good on this planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country. We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have a society where people -- millions of people -- are living paycheck to paycheck. They're working as hard as they ever have, but they're living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn't lead to a job. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting, and around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America -- many the direct response -- direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the -- of state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so here's the truth: this election is about the future, and the Democratic Party, and the political left has no ideas about the future. All their ideas are the same, tired ideas of the past. More government, more spending. For every issue for America, their answer is a new tax on someone, and a new government program. This nation is going to turn the page, and that's what this election should be about, and, as I said at the first debate...</p>

Under her leadership, and Obama's leadership, Iran is getting $100 billion dollars, and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon.</p>

You've been particularly critical of businesses that find all sorts of ways of paying their taxes by keeping money abroad, but your own plan includes an incentive to bring -- that more the $2 trillion dollars home.</p>

As primarily the only politician, I guess other than Carly on the stage, they haven't talked about a corporate inversion. A corporate inversion -- companies are leaving. You know, we used to leave New York to go to Florida. We got better taxes, we got, maybe, something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, they're the United States to go to other countries. They have trillions of dollars in those other countries. They're going for two reasons, they can't get their money back in. It's something where the democrats and the republicans both agree, it's the only thing I can think of. They both agree, let the money come back in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three and a half years, they still can't make a deal. They can't get the money in. It's probably two and a half trillion, but, I think it's much more than that. All of that money could become -- could come right in and be used to rebuild our country, and investments in our country. They can't do it. What we have to do, and what I've done, is made the tax rate -- and one of the reasons they don't (INAUDIBLE) the taxes so obnoxious, they can't do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where, I made it a 10% number, as you know. I've been very highly praised for it. A lot of money's going to come back in, we're going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems, and roadblocks, because that's also a problem. And, we're going to have all of this money pour back into the United States. It's going to be used to build businesses, for jobs, and everything else.</p>

President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions. At the same time, energy production in America has boomed. Is it possible to continue this boom, and move toward energy self-sufficiency, while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate change program?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL: The first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the President has put in place.</p>

The planet's 4.5 billion years old, we've been through geologic age after geologic age. We've had times when the temperatures been warmer, we've had times when the temperatures been colder. We've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher. So, I think before we -- we need to look before we leap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President's often fond of saying he wants a balance solution, but, really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean, and we will have some rules for that. We got to balance that with the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's devastated my state. I say the President's not only destroying Kentucky, he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him. So, what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms, and that means we will have solar, and wind, and hydro, but we will still have coal, and we still will have natural gas. And, we've got to have an all of the above policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields, and shut down the coal power plants. If we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold, or very hot. So, I think it's a big danger, and we shouldn't do it.

And the question I have for all Americans is, think about it, can you be a fiscal conservative if you don't conserve all of the money? If you're a profligate spender, you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military, is that a conservative notion? We have to be conservative with all spending, domestic spending and welfare spending. I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know, the conservative movement is all about opportunity. It is about lower taxes. It's about balanced budgets. It's about less regulation. And it's about sending power, money and influence back to where we live so we can run America from the bottom up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to that, once we have the power and the money and the influence with programs we shift out, that each of us have a responsibility to reach out and to rebuild our families, make them stronger, and connect our neighborhoods.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The events are organized by Angel Labs, a global angel investor academy based in San Francisco whose mission is to widen the influence of angel investing, a field in which the relatively affluent put money into start-ups, usually in the tech industry.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a huge interest in angel investing, but many of these people feel left out of what's happening in Silicon Valley,'' said Tugce Ergul, a co-founder of Angel Labs. ''Most of our attendees have never invested in early-stage companies, but they are accomplished businesspeople who have a lot to offer entrepreneurs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since it started in early 2014, Angel Labs has organized workshops in more than 38 countries, in places like Brunei and Uruguay. While its initial focus was on emerging markets, the group has staged events throughout Europe and, more recently, in the United States. All told, more than 3,500 people have participated in Angel Labs' flagship one-day workshop, and many have gone on to form angel investing groups and to help organize events in their regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investing at this stage is quite different from buying a mature company. You have to be able to evaluate a lot of things, including the founders, and there is a lot of risk,'' said Adi Sariaatmadja, who is head of digital and new media for Emtek, a publicly traded media company in Indonesia that was founded by his father. He attended an event organized by Angel Labs in Bali in September 2014 to get firsthand knowledge of how to evaluate deals and founders who have ideas that meld with Emtek's interest in mobile and digital technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Sariaatmadja, 30, has a degree in finance and worked in private equity before joining his family's company, he said that angel investing required a different approach. In Bali, he and about 40 other attendees learned the basics of angel investing and then broke into small groups to go through case studies. The day concluded with actual start-ups pitching their ideas. After experienced angels questioned the company founders, ''we, the audience, got to ask questions and challenge those guys, like on the television show 'Shark Tank,' '' said Mr. Sariaatmadja, who has since attended two other angel investing events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea for Angel Labs came about after Ms. Ergul and her partners in a Silicon Valley seed-stage investment fund, Startup Labs, traveled to dozens of countries looking for investment ideas. ''We found bright entrepreneurs working on innovative technology, but our model was to co-invest with local investors, and in many cases, there were none,'' said Ms. Ergul, who was raised in Turkey, studied finance at <span class="companylink">Paris-Sorbonne University</span> and worked in investment banking before moving into early-stage investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem was not a lack of interest, a dearth of capital or capable business executives, she said, but ''a lack of understanding about how to value these deals and add value beyond just the cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the Startup Labs fund was fully invested, Ms. Ergul and her colleagues mapped out a strategy to identify would-be angel investors around the world, find local sponsors and demystify angel investing. Today, Ms. Ergul and her four partners have expanded their offerings to include private gatherings, multiday programs and a monthly digital digest started in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To cover costs -- which include a fee paid to Angel Labs for orchestrating the event -- and tap into local expertise, Angel Labs teams up with banks, development organizations, government offices and many other groups interested in promoting entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a strong entrepreneurial community, but we're not as good in financing these companies,'' said Mariano Mayer, the general director of entrepreneurship for the city of Buenos Aires, which hosted its first Angel Labs event late last year. Roughly 150 attendees gathered at the city's General San Martín Cultural Center. Angel Labs is developing five-day boot camps in other cities in Argentina for 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many places around the world, Argentina hopes that by supporting entrepreneurs, it can help diversify an economy that is largely dependent on natural resources. No doubt angel investing is trendy right now, Mr. Mayer said, but it can have a real impact. ''We need entrepreneurs, and they need financing from locals,'' he said. ''Working on educating angels is a big piece of the puzzle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angel Labs is not the only group focusing on international angel investors. In March, the Global Entrepreneurship Network started its own angel investing initiative, the Global Business Angels Network, and it is organizing angel investing meetings around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Access to capital in most of these places is challenging, but it's getting better,'' said Dave McClure, the founding partner of 500 Startups, a global seed-stage venture capital fund and accelerator that has invested in more than 1,000 companies in over 50 countries. Boot camps and meetings help raise awareness, but increasing investment in start-ups will require a real culture of early-stage investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It isn't just a lack of expertise, but a lack of willingness to jump in,'' Mr. McClure said. ''Deals take longer'' outside Silicon Valley, ''and investors want more control,'' he said. That can sometimes work against fledgling companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Risk aversion is an education,'' said Andy Chung, who is leading international expansion efforts for AngelList, an online service that lets accredited investors find and co-invest in deals led by experienced angels. AngelList is currently focused on investors in the United States and Britain, but Mr. Chung said investors from other countries had found their way to the site, which has about 50,000 accredited investors globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new angel investors, the learning curve can be steep, which is why experienced angels lead the charge. New investors typically ''don't understand what it means to invest in early-stage technology, even in developed markets like the U.K. and Australia,'' Mr. Chung said. Even so, ''you're seeing a lot of these markets starting to catch up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will most likely take more than a one-day workshop to create the kind of Silicon Valley culture that these groups want to emulate. ''Investing in entrepreneurs is still a new phenomenon,'' said Marcus Dantus, head of Latin America for Angel Labs and director of Startup México. ''People here invest in traditional businesses, like real estate, and are not as tolerant of failure, which is accepted in Silicon Valley but has a stigma in Latin America.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another challenge: ''Exit strategies are hard to come by,'' Mr. Dantus said. ''It's difficult to do an I.P.O., and there isn't a lot of activity in mergers and acquisitions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet ''in the last five years, there has been a big change in Mexico and all over the world,'' he said. ''In 2008, there were two venture capital funds here in Mexico, and now there are nearly 50.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angel Labs has organized five events throughout Mexico, attracting investors from a wide range of backgrounds, including cattle ranchers and real estate tycoons. ''Ten years ago, if you were to approach somebody with the idea of an angel club, they would think you are a crazy guy,'' Mr. Dantus said. ''Now that entrepreneurship is so fashionable, people want to get involved, but they don't know how.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By giving investors a crash course in angel investing and, more important, connecting them with others interested in making investments, Angel Labs thinks it can nudge people to become involved and, in many cases, form their own investing clubs. Angel Labs has helped start a dozen new investor networks, Ms. Ergul said, and has supported more than 40 existing groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Angel Labs participants say the thrill of taking an active role in the process, and not just a desire for returns, is at the root of their interest in early-stage investing. Some could simply write a check to a venture capital fund or hire advisers to size up deals on their behalf, but they prefer a more hands-on approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For many of these investors, they want to be part of the process, to feel the pleasure of creating something new,'' said Recep Bildik, private market director at the <span class="companylink">Borsa Istanbul</span>, which hosted a 70-person event organized by Angel Labs last January and has a second one planned for early 2016. ''That may be more valuable than the return they're expecting.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more consumers and small-business owners skip the bank and turn instead to online lenders for loans, policy makers in Washington are looking more closely at the operations to determine whether they should be more tightly regulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is widely acknowledged that the lenders provide a vital service by making business financing faster and easier to obtain, elected officials and some experts in the field have expressed concern about the opaque terms and high interest rates on some loans. Because the online lenders operate outside the traditional system, they face fewer regulatory restrictions than mainstream banks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers and government officials have taken a fairly hands-off approach to the industry so far, but those in the industry acknowledge that the scrutiny on them is increasing -- and new rules may follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We seem to be at an inflection point,'' said Karen G. Mills, a senior fellow at <span class="companylink">Harvard Business School</span>. ''The market is so active and alive with new entrants that it's gotten the attention of regulators, and they are recognizing that there is no straightforward or apparent answer to the question of who is going to regulate this sector.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mills, a former administrator of the Small Business Administration, is a co-author of a widely cited paper published last year drawing attention to the fact that online lending ''falls between the cracks'' for federal agencies and is now largely state-regulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, three senators sent a letter to the Treasury Department and the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> seeking information on the market's risks and regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, a member of the <span class="companylink">House Small Business Committee</span> made her own request for information. Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, the committee's ranking Democrat, sent a letter asking the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> and the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> to comment on whether they have the legal authority and resources they need to oversee the online lending market adequately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the Treasury Department is studying the responses it received to a recent request for data and commentary from industry participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online lenders use their own algorithms and underwriting systems to make rapid credit decisions, advancing funds quickly, sometimes within hours, to individuals and businesses. They fill a market gap, especially for small businesses, which have struggled to obtain loans of $250,000 or less, an amount too small for many banks to bother with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first online marketplace lenders began operating around a decade ago, but the number of companies in the field and their transaction volume have increased rapidly in recent years. Loan origination has doubled every year since 2010, reaching $12 billion last year, according to an analysis by <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. <span class="companylink">Lending Club</span>, one of the most prominent lenders, went public last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal regulatory officials are moving cautiously, unwilling to disrupt a still-fledgling industry, but the Treasury Department says that a few themes emerged in the 99 responses it received to its information request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Commenters almost universally agreed on the need for, and benefits of, greater transparency,'' Antonio Weiss, a counselor to the Treasury secretary, said in a speech last month at an industry conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business loans should have standardized pricing disclosures so that borrowers can better understand the cost and directly compare different loan products, he suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study indicated how tricky those comparisons can be. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland</span> gathered 44 small-business owners and asked them to evaluate several loan options. Most initially said they found the comparison easy, but when asked for specific details on the loans' interest rates and costs, the participants frequently gave incorrect answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another issue raised in the responses to the Treasury Department's survey is that small-business loans generally have fewer regulatory protections than consumer loans, allowing companies to charge rates much higher than those permitted for individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many commenters highlighted the need to establish a level playing field,'' Mr. Weiss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That idea doesn't please some lenders. Noah Breslow, the chief executive of OnDeck, a lender that deals exclusively in small-business loans, said that rates that seem punishing -- <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> has in the past made short-term loans with an annual percentage rate of more than 100 percent -- can make sense in a business context when capital can be used to buy inventory, hire workers and generate revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased competition among lenders as the market grows is already working to bring down costs and increase the options for borrowers, he said. <span class="companylink">OnDeck</span> says its weighted average A.P.R. has dropped from nearly 66 percent at the start of 2013 to 42.7 percent last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're one of 50 short-term lending companies.'' he said. ''As the market gets bigger, borrowers have a higher level of choice than they've had in the past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those involved in the Treasury Department's inquiry say it is open-ended, with no decisions yet about what recommendations for changes, if any, will be made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three senators gathering information -- Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, all Democrats -- have asked the Treasury Department and the <span class="companylink">Small Business Administration</span> to respond to their request by the end of the month.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For better or worse, text messaging is the app people spend more time using than any other on their smartphones. A new start-up, Cola, believes it can make it a bit better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up, based in San Francisco and staffed by engineers who used to work at Apple, Nest and other companies, will begin a private test of the iPhone version of a new messaging app, also called Cola, on Thursday. The company has raised an early round of funding from Naval Ravikant, the founder of Angel List; Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL; and others.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise behind Cola, according to David Temkin, the company's chief executive, is that smartphones have primarily become texting devices for many people. Still, Mr. Temkin argues that a lot of the communication that occurs in text messages -- planning where and when to meet, telling your spouse what to get from the supermarket and so on -- is unnecessarily inefficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cola is an attempt to make it easier to accomplish those kinds of tasks in text messages and to give other app makers the programming hooks that allow them to expand the abilities of text messages even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone scheduling a picnic with friends, for example, can text a to-do list to recipients that allows them to claim certain tasks -- like buying sandwiches, bringing a Frisbee and getting beverages. Cola users can share live maps in a text message that update their locations for selected times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Temkin says his company wants other companies to link their apps to Cola, too. An airline or a maker of a flight tracker app, for example, could let Cola users share the location of their planes through a text message. Mr. Temkin, who worked at Apple in the 1990s on Newton, its early mobile device, likens the product to a messaging ''operating system,'' in the sense that others can build software on top of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether people will be willing to download a new messaging app to replace the basic one that comes with their smartphones is the biggest question for the company. Mr. Temkin believes Cola can succeed by bringing the functions people can get in apps like a calendar and mapping programs to text messaging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey of American smartphone owners conducted last November by Pew Research, 97 percent of respondents said they used their phones for text messaging, while 92 percent said they used them for voice and video calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is where the users are,'' Mr. Temkin said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be a Wednesday, and an employee messages, 'Can we talk today?''' said Ms. Martin, who owns Media Maison, a boutique public relations firm in Manhattan. ''They'll tell me they weren't looking, but someone approached them,'' she said. ''In this industry, if another company dangles $5,000 and an opportunity to work on a fashion show, your loyal employee can be out the door.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since any departure leaves her 14-person team short-handed for weeks, Ms. Martin tries to be proactive. She meets frequently with individual staff members, helps new employees pay first and last month's rent, is generous with titles and promotions and offers benefits ranging from educational assistance to a free trip anywhere in the world after three years of employment. Last year's recipient went to Paris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have a 401(k) and can't always offer a big salary,'' she said. ''So I'm forced all the time to think about how to keep key people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a tightening labor market, more entrepreneurs are facing similar challenges. A record number of job openings, with worsening skill shortages and a tendency among young adults toward briefer tenures, is forcing small-business owners to find increasingly creative ways to hold onto their best and brightest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After rising in recent years, quit rates in private businesses held steady at just less than prerecession levels in 2015. But survey data from the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, which looks at job openings and labor turnover by size of establishment, suggest that the number of employees voluntarily leaving small companies remains on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At businesses with fewer than 10 employees, for example, 1.8 million people quit in the five months through May, a 34 percent increase from the same period in 2014, the bureau's data shows. In companies with 10 to 49 employees, resignations rose by 12 percent year over year, and, in those with 50 to 249 employees, the increase was 9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a June 2015 survey by the <span class="companylink">National Federation of Independent Business</span>, 80 percent of employers reported they had difficulty finding, or could not find, the talent they needed. Even when they do find it, said Holly Wade, director of research for the organization, ''issues come into play when small businesses can't afford some of the bells and whistles bigger employers can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colin Darretta, a former investment banker, knew when he founded WellPath Solutions in New York last year that he could not compete with a <span class="companylink">Google</span> or Uber on pay. So in seeking engineering talent for his company, which makes customized nutritional products, he bypassed the Ivy League and hired a local developer from App Academy, in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the candidate had taken a less traditional path, he added, may have made him better suited to a start-up. ''Here was a guy who had developed an interest at a later stage and was willing to take a personal risk to pursue it,'' Mr. Darretta said. ''The key is looking where those big companies aren't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also made a point of spending one-on-one time with all 10 staff members and likes to capitalize on their interests. After a recent busy period, he took a star performer and a newly hired engineer, both big video game players, to a ''League of Legends'' event at Spring Studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company can still try to steal employees by offering more money, Mr. Darretta said. But the employee ''wouldn't be getting the flexibility and the other stuff,'' he added. ''A lot of the time, the other stuff is what matters to people, and it doesn't cost that much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people who leave a company do not do so for more money. In a 2015 survey of 11,000 employees by the staffing company Randstad USA, the main reason cited for quitting was a lack of a career path or growth opportunities. Nearly half of respondents said work-life balance was the biggest factor motivating them to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For any incentives to work over the long term, employees must be invested in a company and its mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Amy Baxter, an Atlanta physician who founded MMJ Labs in 2006, has six employees with advanced degrees on a shoestring budget. Her company developed Buzzy, a hand-held device that uses cold and vibration to relieve pain from causes as varied as hypodermic needles, carpal tunnel syndrome and plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't even get F.D.A. clearance until last year, which makes it all the more amazing that people have stuck with me with no promise of equity,'' Dr. Baxter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said flexibility and transparency helped. MMJ Labs' manufacturing manager spent early years fitting her work hours around an infant daughter's heart treatment. If Buzzy loses a customer, everyone is involved in figuring out what happened and helping to fix it. Outings like the company's regular staff dinners and the all-expenses-paid Caribbean cruise that employees and their families took to celebrate selling the first 25,000 units do not hurt either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Baxter says she believes the main reason her original hires are still with her is their belief in the product and the ethics of the company, including the fact that the device is reusable and in keeping with the company's concern for the environment. ''If I made Buzzy disposable, some employees wouldn't stay with me,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing what really matters to employees, personally and professionally, can be critical to retention, human resources specialists say, and easy to learn in a small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brandon Baker and his wife, Carmela, founded Loveletter Cakeshop on Fifth Avenue two years ago, they knew they would be making wedding cakes for a affluent clientele where there is little room for error. So as soon as they realize they have an exceptional employee, Mr. Baker sits down with him or her to discuss career aspirations and creative interests so he can assign responsibilities accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes just the act of asking is enough,'' Mr. Baker said. ''When you find talent you have to nurture it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This can be challenging as an organization grows. <span class="companylink">Proxibid</span>, which bills itself as the largest online marketplace for high-value items (like tractor-trailers and classic cars), has expanded to 167 employees since its start in 2001. Ryan Downs, the chief executive, also faces the dual challenge of finding young talent and luring it to Omaha, where the company is based. To do that, he says he has worked hard to maintain an open culture that offers opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He credits this with helping him retain the company's top engineers when software developers have never been more in demand, or recruiters more aggressive. ''You're not going to stop recruiters coming around,'' he said. ''But if you give a technical person cutting-edge stuff to work on, we've found you can overcome other companies' irrational prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Mulligan, a senior software engineer, who has been at <span class="companylink">Proxibid</span> four and a half years, agrees. He says that although he hears from one or two recruiters every week, it would be difficult to match the opportunities of his current position, or the voice he has in the direction of the company. <span class="companylink">Proxibid</span>, he added, also gets the culture right, with outings, support and companywide recognition of individual success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For me, that's the biggest thing,'' he said. ''At other places, it was like I was just a number. I know it sounds cheesy, but this is the first company I've come to that truly seems to care if their employees are happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, in the rush to serve customers and clients, communication can quickly fall by the wayside even when small-business owners know better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Niu, a serial entrepreneur, learned this the hard way when he was running <span class="companylink">BuddyTV</span>. In 2012, a top employee quit, seemingly out of the blue. Frustrated and burned out, Mr. Niu took a break from the company. ''It caught me off guard,'' he said. ''I kept thinking, if I had better tools maybe I could have prevented it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That led Mr. Niu to create Tinypulse to help other employers get a grip on retention issues. Tinypulse, which is based in Seattle, and similar companies like Culture Amp and BlackbookHR allow managers to solicit anonymous feedback from employees. This often provides an early warning that workers are unhappy. Today more than 500 companies use Tinypulse alone, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other small-business owners still rely on the old-fashioned way of keeping tabs. At her public relations firm, Ms. Martin says she talks to her employees constantly and has them keep her cellphone number on speed dial. Most recently, she gave the people who have been with her the longest a share in her business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many under-30-year-olds get to say they own something?'' Ms. Martin asked. ''But when you do find someone who is amazing and treats your business like their own you want to reward that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her approach seems to be working. Ross Garner, the senior account executive she sent on a 10-day vacation to Paris last year, said he still could not get over the gesture. ''Stuff like that,'' he said, ''makes you want to work at 110 percent for somebody.''</p>

But the food entrepreneurs at work at the Organic Food Incubator, and dozens more like them, are churning out handcrafted treats to satisfy discriminating palates in a city that never stops eating and never stops talking about eating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York, of course, has an extraordinarily vibrant and eclectic restaurant scene as well as what seems like an endless number of specialty food stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This culinary passion is fueling a growing business sector: food start-ups, driven by weekend chefs, career changers and others hoping to turn their recipes and ambition into money-making businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Food is as hot as tech right now,'' said Richard Madonna, the chief financial officer at Union Theological Seminary, who in 2013 founded an incubator, Union Food Lab, to help aspiring food entrepreneurs get their start. ''You go into any market, and there's a huge selection of products that are made here in New York City. It's artisanal, it's small batch, it's handmade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, the city documented a total of 1,078 food manufacturing companies employing 16,356 workers, up from 940 companies and 14,284 workers in 2008. Those numbers do not fully capture the picture, because many businesses are run illegally out of home kitchens or fail before they get off the ground, according to food industry consultants and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials, seeing food start-ups as sources of jobs and revenue, have invested more than $2.5 million since 2010 to develop three culinary incubators, the Entrepreneur Space in Long Island City, Queens; HBK Incubates in East Harlem; and a third that is scheduled to open early next year, Brooklyn FoodWorks in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The incubators provide access to commercial kitchens and equipment, typically below market rates, along with a host of other support services, like help getting insurance or connecting with potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see it as an area of growth,'' Miquela Craytor, director of industrial initiatives for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn FoodWorks has signed up 30 companies before it even opens its doors; the incubator's ''turnkey cooking experience'' includes garbage removal and laundry service for towels and aprons. ''We are trying to promote and support the entrepreneurs who are looking to turn their passion for food into a profitable business,'' Drew Barrett, its president, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing infrastructure of publicly and privately financed kitchen spaces and artisanal marketplaces has eased the way for a new generation of food entrepreneurs. Kathrine Gregory, a consultant who worked with a nonprofit group in 1996 to create what she described as the city's first culinary incubator on Court Street in Brooklyn, recalled that those earlier efforts were often built around job training programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Ms. Gregory oversees an expanding roster of more than 300 ''food-preneurs,'' as she calls them, at the city-backed Entrepreneur Space, a 12,000-square-foot incubator divided into four kitchens, classrooms and offices in Long Island City. ''A lot of them are professionals coming out of other industries,'' she said. ''In the 1990s, a lot of them were home cooks. Now we still have home cooks, but also former lawyers and financial services executives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Harlem, the Union Food Lab has been used by more than 40 food start-ups, a dozen of which have become regulars. Others have fizzled. Mr. Madonna, who often stops by for tastings, recalled that one woman found out the hard way that her brownie recipe did not work on a large scale. ''I think my face when I tried the brownie said a lot,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Madonna, who charges $25 an hour to use the kitchen, said he hears from newcomers every week, including one recently who makes an alcohol-infused gummy bear. ''In technology, there's a barrier for many entrepreneurs -- you need to understand coding -- but in food, you just need a good recipe and you need to be motivated,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hella Company is one success story. It grew out of the home brews that Jomaree Pinkard, Tobin Ludwig and Eduardo Simeon used to give out as birthday and holiday gifts. They were such a hit that in 2011, the men set out to raise $900 through a Kickstarter campaign to make enough for all of their friends. They raised $2,300, or enough for extra bottles that they handed out to bars and liquor stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The orders poured in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three men scraped together $7,500 and founded their company with no investors, employees or storefront. Instead, they rented space first at HBK Incubates, and after outgrowing that, the Organic Food Incubator. This year alone, they have realized nearly $1 million in sales so far of their bitters, mixes and do-it-yourself cocktail kits, up from $500,000 the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pinkard, 37, a graduate of the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of Business</span> of the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span> who previously worked as a consultant for the National Football League, said Hella could not have succeeded without the incubators. ''If you're not financed upfront, there are all these things you need, which are impossible for a start-up,'' he said. ''For most companies that would stop you in your tracks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At HBK Incubates, which is run by the nonprofit Hot Bread Kitchen, nearly one-third of the 140 companies that have used the kitchen were started by low-income residents. Clinton Shabazz, for instance, used to sell the pies that he baked for his company, the Harlem PieMan, off a table on 125th Street. With the incubator's help, he has formalized and expanded the company. Last month, he filled one of his largest orders yet: 300 pecan, sweet potato and apple crumb minipies for Barnard College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nice thing about food is it is equal opportunity,'' said Jessamyn Rodriguez, the founder of Hot Bread Kitchen, which also operates a commercial bakery and a job-training program along with the incubator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The products from these food start-ups make it into stores across the city, including <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> and specialty markets like Brooklyn Kitchen, as well as the artisanal marketplace Smorgasburg and the website Mouth.com, among other outlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At By Brooklyn in Carroll Gardens, which carries only items made in the borough, the handiwork of more than 30 different start-up food makers is on display, including sauces, condiments, chocolates, honey and granola. ''I look for something that is unique or different,'' said Gaia DiLoreto, the store's owner. ''But I also look for quality. It has to taste good. Just because it's made here doesn't mean it tastes good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. DiLoreto said she also looks for food makers who can make regular deliveries, especially during the holidays when more people are buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens, 50 food companies work out of the Organic Food Incubator, a 20,000-square-foot space with communal kitchens that can be rented by the day. Karen Freer, 40, a bank secretary turned baker, started Free Bread in the incubator in 2012 after learning she had celiac disease. ''In the beginning, there was a lot of commiserating about the fact that none of us could afford to buy our own products in the stores,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incubator was opened in 2011 by Michael Schwartz, 48, a former cook at Le Cirque and an instructor at the <span class="companylink">Institute of Culinary Education</span>. Six months earlier, Mr. Schwartz had leased the incubator space to use only for his start-up, BAO Food and Drink, which makes fermented condiments and sauces. But as the bills piled up, he took in other start-ups, with the stipulation that they make organic or healthy foods with no artificial sweeteners or harmful preservatives. ''At first, it was an experiment in trying not to go out of business, to be honest,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most clients had never run a food business before. Just about every week, someone would crash into the metal gate at the loading dock while trying to back up a delivery truck, necessitating costly repairs. One purveyor of ketchups and barbecue sauces suddenly disappeared one day after running out of money, owing $2,000 in rent and leaving bottles and ingredients behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was always someone new to come along. Two years ago, Mr. Schwartz leased space on the second floor to fit in more companies. He still does not have enough room, and said he had turned away dozens of new companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been nonstop,'' he said. ''Everyone's making products.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WALL STREET is still out of control. Seven years ago, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and the Treasury Department bailed out the largest financial institutions in this country because they were considered too big to fail. But almost every one is bigger today than it was before the bailout. If any were to fail again, taxpayers could be on the hook for another bailout, perhaps a larger one this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To rein in Wall Street, we should begin by reforming the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, which oversees financial institutions and which uses monetary policy to maintain price stability and full employment. Unfortunately, an institution that was created to serve all Americans has been hijacked by the very bankers it regulates.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent decision by the Fed to raise interest rates is the latest example of the rigged economic system. Big bankers and their supporters in Congress have been telling us for years that runaway inflation is just around the corner. They have been dead wrong each time. Raising interest rates now is a disaster for small business owners who need loans to hire more workers and Americans who need more jobs and higher wages. As a rule, the Fed should not raise interest rates until unemployment is lower than 4 percent. Raising rates must be done only as a last resort -- not to fight phantom inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What went wrong at the Fed? The chief executives of some of the largest banks in America are allowed to serve on its boards. During the Wall Street crisis of 2007, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, served on the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span>'s board of directors while his bank received more than $390 billion in financial assistance from the Fed. Next year, four of the 12 presidents at the regional <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> Banks will be former executives from one firm: <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are clear conflicts of interest, the kind that would not be allowed at other agencies. We would not tolerate the head of <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil</span> running the <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span>. We don't allow the <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span> to be dominated by Verizon executives. And we should not allow big bank executives to serve on the boards of the main agency in charge of regulating financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If I were elected president, the foxes would no longer guard the henhouse. To ensure the safety and soundness of our banking system, we need to fundamentally restructure the Fed's governance system to eliminate conflicts of interest. Board members should be nominated by the president and chosen by the Senate. Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and to handpick its members and staff. Board positions should instead include representatives from all walks of life -- including labor, consumers, homeowners, urban residents, farmers and small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed must also make sure that financial institutions are investing in the productive economy by providing affordable loans to small businesses and consumers that create good jobs. How? First, we should prohibit commercial banks from gambling with the bank deposits of the American people. Second, the Fed must stop providing incentives for banks to keep money out of the economy. Since 2008, the Fed has been paying financial institutions interest on excess reserves parked at the central bank -- reserves that have grown to an unprecedented $2.4 trillion. That is insane. Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that would be used to provide direct loans to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, as a condition of receiving financial assistance from the Fed, large banks must commit to increasing lending to creditworthy small businesses and consumers, reducing credit card interest rates and fees, and providing help to underwater and struggling homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also need transparency. Too much of the Fed's business is conducted in secret, known only to the bankers on its various boards and committees. Full and unredacted transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee must be released to the public within six months, not five years, which is the custom now. If we had made this reform in 2004, the American people would have learned about the housing bubble well in advance of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, I inserted an amendment in Dodd-Frank to audit the emergency lending by the Fed during the financial crisis. We need to go further and require the <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> to conduct a full and independent audit of the Fed each and every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial reforms must not stop with the central bank. We must reinstate Glass-Steagall and break up the too-big-to-fail financial institutions that threaten our economy. But we need to start with fundamental change. The sad reality is that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> doesn't regulate Wall Street; Wall Street regulates the Fed. It's time to make banking work for the productive economy and for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And it begins by making the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> a more democratic institution, one that is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans rather than the billionaires on Wall Street.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucked inside the mammoth tax and spending bill passed by Congress this month is a much-anticipated provision that will lock in a large tax break for small-business capital investments that has been temporary until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The break is intended to make it more affordable for small companies to buy up to $500,000 a year worth of equipment like computers, machinery and vehicles.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as the Section 179 deduction, the tax provision allows qualifying capital items to be written off immediately on a business's taxes, instead of being depreciated over a number of years. That has the effect of lowering a business's taxable profits, sometimes significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deduction is essentially limited to small and midsize companies. It begins phasing out when a company spends more than $2 million a year on qualifying purchases, and is eliminated entirely for those that spend more than $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Kortesmaki, the owner of London Road Rental Center in Duluth, Minn., relies on the deduction to stock up on equipment for his machinery and party supplies rental business. This year, he is using it to help pay for some $200,000 in new goods, including chairs, a mini-excavator, four trailers, an insulation blower and a sewer camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been able to grow my company very quickly because I've been able to reinvest whatever I made in buying more equipment to rent,'' said Mr. Kortesmaki, who has 11 full-time workers at his 13-year-old company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deduction works like this: If a company has a $90,000 profit and decides to spend $50,000 of it on new computers, the company would normally write off the cost of the equipment gradually, deducting a portion of it each year over the span of the computers' useful life. But Section 179 allows the business to deduct the entire $50,000 cost at once in the year the equipment is purchased, reducing the company's taxable profit to $40,000. (The deduction cannot exceed a business's total net income.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all small businesses, even the very tiniest, should consider taking advantage of the deduction, said Tanya Ouellette, an accountant with Raiche &amp; Company in Dover, N.H.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't have to be a huge piece of equipment,'' she said. ''I tell my clients, 'If you bought a new Apple laptop, we're going to take a 179 on that.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For equipment dealers like Sherry Wuebben, who sells farm machinery, the permanence is as big a deal as the tax break itself. For the last few years, she and her customers have watched nervously as the year's final days slipped away, wondering when -- and whether -- Congress would renew the deal that many business owners rely on to finance their big-ticket purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would get phone calls every day from customers about it, wondering if they should go ahead and buy,'' said Ms. Wuebben, who is an owner of St. Joseph Equipment in La Crosse, Wis. ''The uncertainty weighed very heavily on them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Section 179 was once a fairly limited tax break, with an annual cap of $25,000 or less. But in 2003, Congress temporarily raised the limit to $100,000, and in 2008, as the recession set in, it raised the cap again to $250,000. In 2010, hoping to stimulate more spending, Congress increased the limit to $500,000, allowing businesses to use the deduction toward expensive items like factory machinery and trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But each increase was a temporary measure requiring annual reauthorization to prevent the cap from returning to $25,000 -- and Congress developed a habit of waiting until the very last days of the year to make a decision. In 2012, it missed the calendar deadline completely and passed legislation on Jan 1, 2013, retroactively raising the deduction limit for equipment business owners had purchased the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The uncertainty drives my clients up a tree,'' said Paul Neiffer, an accountant with <span class="companylink">CliftonLarsonAllen</span> in Yakima, Wash., who specializes in the agricultural industry. ''Not knowing each year if it will be extended prevents a lot of our farmers from pulling the trigger on buying equipment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From now on, they will know. Signed on Friday by President Obama, the 233-page tax deal includes in its myriad tax breaks one that permanently sets the Section 179 cap at $500,000, subject to inflation adjustments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kortesmaki said he was confident enough that Congress would once again lift Section 179's cap to go ahead this year with his planned capital purchases, even before the legislation was passed. But other business owners held off -- and this year, the deal came too late for some, Ms. Wuebben thinks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't plan to spend that kind of money with just two weeks left in the year,'' she said. ''We might see some activity this year, but the real benefit for us will come next year, when customers can plan ahead for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies do try to jam in qualifying purchases before the calendar year ends. Last year, Congress raised the Section 179 limit for the year on Dec. 16. The next day, the prices farm machinery sold for at auctions increased compared with just a few days earlier, according to Greg Peterson, the owner of Machinery Pete, a site that tracks equipment auction prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The response is nearly Pavlovian at this point,'' he said. ''The farm audience had grown so used to this annual silly dance of wait-and-see on our friends in Washington.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making Section 179's higher limit permanent will cost taxpayers $77 billion in foregone revenue over the next 10 years, according to a government estimate. The tax break's aim is to stimulate spending -- but does it work?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by the <span class="companylink">Congressional Research Service</span> found that expensing allowances like Section 179 appear to ''have a minor effect at best'' on how much businesses spend on capital goods. Expectations for future sales growth, not tax considerations, motivates most of the investment in the kinds of assets eligible for expensing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main advantage of expensing allowances, the report suggests, comes from simplifying the tax accounting business owners face on their capital purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, owners like Mr. Kortesmaki see the tax break as a crucial one for helping their small business grow a bit bigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd rather invest that money in my business than pay taxes on it,'' he said. ''Having this become permanent makes my business planning for the next few years a whole lot easier.''</p>
