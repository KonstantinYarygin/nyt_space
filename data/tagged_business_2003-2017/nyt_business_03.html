<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, it's not chance or fate. You earned it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most entrepreneurs tell me almost sheepishly that luck has played a big part in their success. Sure, like Tiger Woods gets lucky.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Karen Kowal, founder of Mother Earth Designs, a company that makes pillows for people with chronic pain. She was content with her nursing career, she says, until she got three ''messages'' over 13 months in the early 1990s that she might want to seek fulfillment elsewhere. Each communique took the form of a traffic accident.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, a car driven by a woman putting on makeup rammed the rear of her stalled Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, leaving her with severe whiplash injuries. ''That was my first message,'' Ms. Kowal said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later, while her Cutlass was in the shop, a car accelerated rather than braked at a stop sign, spun around and slammed into the driver's side of her rented vehicle, sending her to the hospital with fractured ribs, herniated discs, deep bruises and a damaged jaw. ''My second message,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year later, a car shot out of a parking lot, crashing into the passenger side of her Olds and inflicting additional rib, neck and jaw injuries. Her third message.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, her body was so wracked by back and neck pain she couldn't sleep for more than 45 minutes. She finally found relief in massage therapy, and her recovery propelled her into a succession of entrepreneurial careers, first as a masseuse, then as a jewelry designer and finally as a developer of pain-management pillows that today has 14 employees and revenue in excess of $500,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It all happened, supposedly, because of that wildly improbable series of near-death experiences.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It gets weirder. In 1997, when her pillow business was in its infancy, a bike accident fractured her pelvis in four places. Unable to go to jewelry shows or give massages, she ran out of money and fell behind on her house payments. Desperate, she applied for food stamps. On the day the application form came in the mail, so did a check for $3,333, her share of a life insurance policy her father had taken out without telling anyone. She paid her bills, hired two helpers to drive her to a jewelry show and was back on the entrepreneurial trail. ''There was a greater hand in this than my own,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortune apparently also cast a benevolent eye on Bill Meyer, co-owner and president of Infocast, a San Fernando, Calif., producer of business conferences. When a proposal landed on his desk in 1989 for organizing a symposium on power-project financing, he shoved it into a file and forgot about it. His specialty was banking law and he had little interest in switching gears.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, he came across the same pitch in a stack of papers on the floor. ''Didn't I just put this one away?'' he wondered. Yes, he had. ''I looked back and forth at both pieces of paper stupidly until I realized I had received two different proposals in the space of a few days,'' he said. ''I decided: This must be a sign.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He took the plunge, even though he thought the topic was too esoteric to attract much interest. The conference was a smashing success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or how about this chain of events related to me by a West Coast software developer. It just so happened that his wife switched their usual Friday night at the symphony hall to a Wednesday, that an investor he had met on a management-training hike years earlier was attending the performance, that the investor spotted him and tapped him on the shoulder, that the software developer casually mentioned a money-making brainstorm that had recently occurred to him and that the investor offered him half a million dollars on the spot for a 20 percent stake in a company that didn't exist. ''It was the most serendipitous event in my business career,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheer luck? Not really, says Mark P. Rice, dean of the F. W. Olin Graduate School of Business at Babson College and a former small-business owner. Rather, he says, entrepreneurs stumble upon amazing coincidences all the time because they are world-class schmoozers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most people go through life constrained by the path they are on,'' Mr. Rice said. ''The key with entrepreneurs is that they are always making connections that we don't make. They are proactive at creating large networks of colleagues, investors, advisers. They can't not be lucky.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Ms. Kowal, the nurse turned pillow maker. As a child she studied the violin for 8 years and the piano for 10, acted in school plays, sang in the church choir, taught swimming lessons, delivered newspapers at 5 a.m., started a landscaping service and rose up the ranks of the Girl Scouts. After a year in college, she went to nursing school and, to pay the bills, played the guitar and sang in coffeehouses. She married and had five children and held down part-time nursing jobs while raising them. She was thinking about what to do next when she had that fateful first car accident.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My point is that she was and always will be a whirlwind of activity, moving around, figuring the angles, pondering the next adventure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another entrepreneur I talked to recently said that only in retrospect can she see how, in her entrepreneurial career, ''all sorts of pieces were falling together that would guarantee us success in future businesses.'' Though a store she opened failed, while running it she joined a barter group that greased her passage to a business that sold used computers, an undertaking that also fizzled but made enough money to finance an addition to her house.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when her next venture was veering toward collapse, she rescued it with a home-equity credit line that wouldn't have existed had she not built the addition. Her latest business subsequently flourished. ''Everything links together,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it isn't really luck. Or is it? I've heard a lot of stories over the years about providential twists of fate that saved entrepreneurs from disaster. I'd love to hear yours.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the enthusiasm of novices, they figured everything would be ready by the spring. Then they went to Restaurant Management Boot Camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sponsored by the city's Department of Small Business Services and Seedco, a national community development group, Boot Camp aims to help small restaurants get off the ground and thrive -- and strengthen the city's economy. Through free monthly seminars at the city's Business Solutions Center, prospective restaurateurs can get help developing business plans, analyzing the market, dealing with health inspections and navigating city bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Viggianos were floored to learn of the regulations and licenses they would be facing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They scrapped the mariachis, which would require a cabaret license. They nixed the idea of formal, matching uniforms, because they would be required to provide laundering services for employees. And they decided to postpone the sidewalk tables, which would require architectural sketches and another license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than demoralizing them, Boot Camp seems to have strengthened their dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It opened up our eyes to what we were starting to do,'' said Mr. Viggiano, who has a storefront real estate business in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. ''We had to say, let's back off, and make sure we're doing this right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They hope to open their restaurant, the Mexican Piramide, this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants seem to be the most alluring ambition for small entrepreneurs in New York these days. The dining scene is booming in nearly every neighborhood. But according to a study published in the Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly in 2005, 60 percent will close within their first three years. The goal of the Boot Camp, and programs connected to it, is to help give new restaurants a stable, sensible foundation. One way is to make people aware of what they're up against.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small mom and pops need to know the regulations much better,'' said C. K. Chung, a staff consultant who has met with about 350 hopefuls and helped about a dozen restaurants open since the program began two years ago. ''Boot Camp is a portal for them to know how to run a restaurant business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose Luis Hernandez knows the difficulties, having worked in the business since he was a 15-year-old prep cook fresh from Puebla, Mexico, earning $183 for a 48-hour week. But he wants his own place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the time I'm 35, I want to work for myself,'' said Mr. Hernandez, who is now 31. ''It's going to be hard because I have to do a good business plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Mr. Hernandez left his job as sous-chef at Alfredo of Rome in Midtown to start a restaurant with his life savings of about $100,000. Then his partner pulled out. To buy some time, he joined the kitchen at Morandi in Greenwich Village and moved in with family to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In between English classes and shifts as a line cook Mr. Hernandez has been looking for investors and testing his menu on friends and family. He's proudest of his own creations, inspired by his childhood in Puebla: a rib-eye steak in a hibiscus flower sauce, and traditional torta de maiz, a sweet corn cake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's been working with the Boot Camp and other programs of the restaurant initiative to refine his business plan, work out marketing strategies and find loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program's expertise has its limits, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''An owner has to know all the aspects of a restaurant,'' said Bill Guilfoyle, an associate professor in the business management program at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Programs there and at other culinary schools cover everything from hiring servers to emptying grease traps, and are taught by experienced professionals. New York City's program -- apparently the nation's first public effort to train restaurateurs -- is run instead by small-business experts. ''I'm sure this is helpful, but I don't think that there's any way that anyone who's totally inexperienced in the restaurant industry could really succeed with just this amount of information,'' Mr. Guilfoyle said of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or as Gloria Jean Brown, the owner of a cafe in Harlem, said, ''They can't tell me how to run a kitchen, how to bake a pie.'' Still, Ms. Brown is glad she found the Boot Camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A part-time caterer for years, Ms. Brown, and her husband, Tommy, a retired baker, used their savings to convert an abandoned beauty parlor into the T&amp;J Bakery and Cafe, in 2005. While locals loved their sweet potato cheesecake, the Browns had underestimated their expenses, and by late 2006, they were struggling to stay open. Mr. Chung helped them get a $65,000 loan from Seedco's financial arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linking one restaurant owner with a loan might be a small victory, but the idea is that every bit counts, Mr. Chung said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We provide a threshold of knowledge for them,'' he said. ''When they graduate Boot Camp, they have their own way of starting their business.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- With its decidedly '50s-era menu -- chili, cheese fries, shakes and half-smoke sausages, a distinctive regional specialty -- Ben's Chili Bowl, a restaurant near the Howard University campus, might not seem a likely business to be at the vanguard of Washington's ''green power'' movement.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this summer, the owners of Ben's Chili Bowl joined with nine other small, independent and mostly food-related businesses on or near U Street to buy wind power energy credits.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see this as part of being involved in what is good for the neighborhood, what's good for the city,'' said Nizam Ali, whose parents, Ben and Virginia Ali, opened their chili place in 1958. ''It's a good idea that helps the environment and, it turns out, makes economic sense for all of us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, there is a boom in wind power as companies and institutions clamor for ways to go green. Most have been large electric power customers like universities, hospitals, hotels, government agencies or owners of large office buildings. But the initiative by these very small businesses in Washington illustrates that green energy is not just for the major players.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Individually, these businesses probably wouldn't have been able to afford to switch to wind power, but buying as a group, it works,'' said Gary Skulnik, co-founder of Clean Currents, a two-year-old renewable power brokerage and consulting firm that arranged the deal between the U Street businesses and their electricity provider.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Skulnik says that with its agreement, the U Street consortium is buying nearly two million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy a year. He maintains that in terms of the carbon dioxide replaced, this use of alternative energy will have the same impact as taking 185 motor vehicles off the road for a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal that the U Street businesses made was with  <span class="companylink">Washington Gas Energy Services Inc.</span>, an alternative supplier in the Washington area, which buys energy from wind farms in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic states. The owners of the utility lines in the area,  <span class="companylink">Pepco</span>, the main electricity company in the Washington area, will guarantee the service, and the businesses will continue to be billed through  <span class="companylink">Pepco.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their name, the ''wind certificates'' that the U Street merchants bought do not guarantee that their power comes from wind farms that generate electricity. The more formal name is ''renewable energy certificates,'' or RECs, and they cover a combination of renewable energy sources including wind, solar and geothermal power.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the certificates,  <span class="companylink">Washington Gas Energy Services</span> will get credit for the amount of electricity it buys that does not come from plants that burn coal, oil or natural gas under a new District of Columbia law requiring utilities to increase their use of renewable energy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is growing evidence, scientists and environmental advocates say, that the carbon dioxide emitted in the production of electricity by fossil-fuel power plants has contributed to global warming.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with Ben's Chili Bowl, the other businesses in the wind power consortium are Boundless Yoga, CakeLove, Love Cafe, Rumberos restaurant, Coppi's Organic restaurant, Busboys &amp; Poets, the Luna Grill and Diner, the Diner and Tryst, which is a coffee house and restaurant. Their transition from conventional power to wind has been seamless and required no equipment or changes in the way they do business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their three-year agreement, the businesses expect to save a total of about $21,000 annually, or an average of about 9 percent each. Mr. Skulnik's company earns a 1 percent commission on the total electric bills; the commission is paid by the power provider.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more energy a business uses, the greater the potential savings. Busboys &amp; Poets, for example, a 4,000-square-foot restaurant that serves up jazz and free Wi-Fi from 8 a.m. until midnight, will probably save more than CakeLove, a bakery that operates in a little less than 1,000 square feet of space.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Weeks, the owner of Boundless Yoga, is the only member of the group who will pay higher electric bills because of her participation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my industry, it is important that we be a leader in sustainability of the environment,'' said Ms. Weeks, whose yoga studio occupies about 2,000 square feet on two levels. ''We need to show our customers that we are doing what we can to choose to go green, even if it's more expensive.'' Ms. Weeks also said that compared with rent and other expenses, the cost of electricity is marginal for her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses like Boundless Yoga represent the new face of U Street. Known before World War II as Washington's Black Broadway, the street was an entertainment and shopping area, where artists like Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald performed. U Street started to lose its luster in the 1960s, and its decline was hastened by rioting there after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Some businesses that remained struggled until the late 1990s, when new residential development led to a turnaround.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some of the businesses that helped to spark the revival of the strip are feeling the pressure of its success. Most of them are tenants, not owners of their spaces. As the neighborhood property values have risen, so have some rents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Latino Economic Development Corporation formed a coalition of small independent businesses, including all of those on U Street that are using wind power, to help them handle the pressures of rising costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Ayari de la Rosa, business program manager of the nonprofit group, has negotiated group rates for insurance, advertising and marketing for alliance members.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. de la Rosa was the matchmaker between the U Street businesses and Clean Currents. ''In this city, it is getting harder and harder for small businesses to stay in areas like U Street,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. de la Rosa met Mr. Skulnik when she was searching for additional ways for the alliance members to share costs. ''We started working on ways for these businesses to save money by combining economically and environmentally sustainable business practices,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Skulnik said he expected his company, based in Rockville, Md., to complete a wind power deal soon for a second group of small businesses in Washington.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes the demand for green energy from businesses of all sizes and types can only grow as jurisdictions demand that power companies provide alternatives to fossil-fuel energy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The District of Columbia and 23 states have mandates or stated goals that push utilities toward renewable energy. Last year, voters in Washington approved a renewable energy standard for the city requiring that electric power providers gradually increase the amount of renewable energy they generate. The new law says the percentage must be 11 percent by 2022.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are beginning to make the connection between our dependence on fossil fuel and the cost of energy and global warming,'' said Mr. Skulnik, who started Clean Currents after working for nearly a decade in the nonprofit world as an advocate for the environment. ''They are also learning that they do have a choice as to who provides their electric power and the sources of that power.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LILONGWE, Malawi -- When Yang Jie left home at 18, he was doing what people from China's hardscrabble Fujian Province have done for generations: emigrating in search of a better living overseas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What set him apart was his destination. Instead of the traditional adopted homelands like the United States and Europe, where Fujian people have settled by the hundreds of thousands, he chose this small, landlocked country in southern Africa.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before I left China,'' said Mr. Yang, now 25, ''I thought Africa was all one big desert.'' So he figured that ice cream would be in high demand, and with money pooled from relatives and friends, he created his own factory at the edge of Lilongwe, Malawi's capital. The climate is in fact subtropical, but that has not stopped his ice cream company from becoming the country's biggest.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories like this have become legion across Africa in the past five years or so, as hundreds of thousands of Chinese have discovered the continent, setting off to do business in a part of the world that had been terra incognita. The Xinhua News Agency recently estimated that at least 750,000 Chinese were working or living for extended periods on the continent, a reflection of deepening economic ties between China and Africa that reached $55 billion in trade in 2006, compared with less than $10 million a generation earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when Mr. Yang arrived here in 2001, he said, he could go weeks without encountering another traveler from his homeland. But as surely as his investments in the country have prospered, he said, an increasingly large community of Chinese migrants has taken root, and now runs everything from small factories to health care clinics and trading companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the previous wave of Chinese interest in Africa in the 1960s and '70s, an era of radical socialism and proclaimed third-world solidarity, European and American companies held sway over economies in most of the continent. Here and there, though, the Chinese made their presence felt, often in drably dressed, state-run work brigades that built stadiums, railroads and highways, crushing rocks and doing other labor by hand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, in many of the countries where the new Chinese emigrants have settled, like Chad, Chinese-owned pharmacies, massage parlors and restaurants serving a variety of regional Chinese cuisines can be found; the Western presence, once dominant, has steadily dwindled, and essentially consists nowadays of relief experts working international agencies or oil workers, living behind high walls in heavily guarded enclaves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, this new Chinese exodus was driven largely by word of mouth, as pioneers like Mr. Yang relayed news back home of abundant opportunities in a part of the world where many economies lie undeveloped or in ruins, and where even in the richer countries many things taken for granted in the developed world await builders and investors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions like these often deter Western investors, but for many budding Chinese entrepreneurs, Africa's emerging economies are inviting precisely because they seem small and accessible. Competition is often weak or nonexistent, and for African customers, the low price of many Chinese goods and services make them more affordable than their Western counterparts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese Expansion   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You Xianwen sold his pipe-laying business in Chengdu, in southwest China, this year to move to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, to join a startup company with a Chinese partner he had met only online. ''Back where I come from we are pretty independent people,'' Mr. You, 55, said. ''My brothers and sisters all supported my decision to come here. In fact, they say that if things really work out for me, they would like to move to Africa, too.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. You said he had considered other African countries before settling on Ethiopia, including Zambia. ''Luckily I didn't decide to go there,'' he said, explaining that he had been frightened by the recent anti-Chinese protests in that country.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new business, ABC Bioenergy, builds devices that generate combustible gas from ordinary refuse, providing what Mr. You said would be an affordable alternative source of energy in a country where electricity supplies are erratic and prices high.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. You's partner here, Mei Haijun, first came to Ethiopia a decade ago to work at a Chinese-built textile factory and has since married an Ethiopian woman, with whom he has a child. ''When I first came here you could go two months without seeing another Chinese person,'' he said. ''But it is a different era now. There's a flight to China every day.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in air traffic between China and countries like Ethiopia now has Chinese companies scrambling to add new routes, as the Chinese government and big Chinese companies increase their stake in Africa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that activity reflects an intense appetite for African oil and mineral resources needed to fuel China's manufacturing sector, but big Chinese companies have quickly become formidable competitors in other sectors as well, particularly for big-ticket public works contracts. China is building major new railroad lines in Nigeria and Angola, large dams in Sudan, airports in several countries and new roads, it seems, almost everywhere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the largest road builders, China Road and Bridge Construction, has picked up where the solidarity brigades of an earlier generation left off. The company, which is owned by the Chinese government, has 29 projects in Africa, many financed by the World Bank or other lenders, and it maintains offices in 22 African countries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa to Beijing brimming with Chinese contractors, workers from Road and Bridge and other companies swapped notes on the grab bag of countries they work in, and debated about the difficulties of learning Portuguese and French in places like Mozambique and Ivory Coast.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Africans view the influx of Chinese with a mix of anticipation and dread. Business leaders in Chad, a central African nation with deepening oil ties to China, are bracing for what they suspect will be an army of Chinese workers and investors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect a large influx of at least 40,000 Chinese in the coming years,'' said Renaud Dinguemnaial, director of Chad's Chamber of Commerce. ''This massive arrival could be a plus for the economy, but we are also worried. When they arrive, will they bring their own workers, stay in their own houses, send all their money home?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Zambia, where anti-Chinese sentiment has been building for several years, merchants at the central market in Lusaka, the capital, said that if Chinese people wanted to come to Africa, they should come as investors, building factories, not as petty traders who compete for already scarce customers for bottom-dollar items like flip-flops and T-shirts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chinese claim to come here as investors, but they are trading just like us,'' said Dorothy Mainga, who sells knockoff Puma sneakers and Harley Davidson T-shirts in the Kamwala Market in Lusaka. ''They are selling the same things we are selling at cheap prices. We pay duty and tax, but they use their connections to avoid paying tax.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Chinese oil workers have been kidnapped in Nigeria and in Ethiopia, where nine were killed by an armed separatist movement in May, the growing Chinese presence around the continent has produced few serious incidents.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Misunderstandings are common, however, and resentments inevitably arise. Africans in many countries complain that Chinese workers occupy jobs that locals are either qualified for or could be easily trained to do. ''We are happy to have the Chinese here,'' said Dennis Phiri, 21, a Malawian university student who is studying to become an engineer. ''The problem with the Chinese companies is that they reserve all the good jobs for their own people. Africans are only hired in menial roles.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another frequent criticism is that the Chinese are clannish, sticking among themselves day and night.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Addis Ababa, in what is a typical arrangement for most large companies, the 200 Chinese workers for the Road and Bridge Corporation live in a communal compound, eating food prepared by cooks brought from China and receiving basic health care from a Chinese doctor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After a day off you wonder what you're doing here, so we like to keep working,'' said Cheng Qian, the country manager for the road-building company in Ethiopia. He added that his family had never visited him during several years of work here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African Ambivalence   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the Chinese approach has created serious frictions with African workers. At a leading hotel here in Lilongwe, breakfast guests stared as an agitated Chinese traveling salesman, sweating profusely, screamed at his staff minutes before his pitch on nutritional supplements was set to begin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You say it is not your fault, but the way you are doing things is just stupid, stupid,'' the man sputtered before a clutch of African assistants, who looked humiliated. ''You people are unbelievable.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the salesman finally left the room, members of the restaurant staff gathered near the door and vented their disgust. ''We don't need people like that to come here and colonize us again,'' one said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After nearly seven years in Malawi, Yang Jie, the ice cream maker, seems to have learned better. Greeting his workers at the ice cream factory, he begins the day by asking, ''How did you sleep last night?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One quickly replied, ''Very well,'' sounding a bit formal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't tell me a lie,'' Mr. Yang answered with a sly, friendly smile. ''It's O.K. to tell me your worries.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Wick family, owners of a century-old company that makes pipe organs, could have easily given up. Demand for the organs has plunged over the last few decades, as churchgoers took a liking to the modern sounds of electronic instruments. Soaring manufacturing costs have made new pipe organs prohibitively expensive, with some organs priced over $1 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Wicks have no intention of shutting down, even though the number of pipe organs built in the United States has shrunk to just 100 from about 400 in the last 30 years.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compete better, the Wicks have started making digital organs and automated some manufacturing to keep prices down. They also have two surprising product lines in their roster: airplane parts and home furniture.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In an organ company, a lot of people are builders and very good with their hands,'' said Mark Wick, the company's chief operating officer whose grandfather founded the Wicks Organ Company in 1906. ''Even when they go home at night, they're still going to build something -- it could be an airplane, a kitchen cabinet or a boat -- because that's their passion.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a story as old as business itself. Industries boom and bust, and sometimes a pool of customers that might have supported a company for years dries up. Entrepreneurs in particular easily fall prey to such cycles, says David Hsu, entrepreneurship professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A small-business owner who only has a single business line faces much more volatility and risk,'' Mr. Hsu said. ''If that one product line becomes obsolete, it's going to be harder for the business owner to compete.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wick family got into the airplane parts business by accident in the early 1970s, after employees used a hobby kit to build a recreational plane that drew the attention of other hobbyists. Today, Wicks supplies recreational airplane makers with 15,000 parts that bring in about $5 million a year, or nearly half of the company's revenue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home furniture was added in 1997, after Mr. Wick's sister Mary graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in industrial design. The family decided to tap her expertise and the company's access to wood, equipment and builders to diversify further. The company now builds everything from high-end bookshelves to wine cellars, which account for about 5 percent of revenue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organs still account for about half of revenue, but Mr. Wick says having a foothold in other sectors has added stability to the bottom line.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By branching into new territory while still running the pipe organ business, the Wicks have smartly planned for the future, says Rita McGrath, management professor at the Columbia Business School.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My advice is to have some options out there,'' Ms. McGrath said, suggesting that entrepreneurs become partners with other business owners even in good times, or invest in ventures unrelated to their own. ''When you just do one thing and that thing goes wrong, you don't have a lot of options.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs who plan poorly can find themselves scrambling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Barofsky and his wife, Gail, made a comfortable living for 16 years running Sunrise Vacations in West Palm Beach, Fla. But after the attacks of Sept. 11, things changed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States travel revenue plunged, airlines stopped paying travel agents commissions on tickets and more travelers were booking their trips online.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One day we woke up and said, 'Oh my goodness. What are we in business for?' '' Mr. Barofsky recalled, explaining that little money remained after he covered expenses and paid his three employees.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with thousands of travel agents who have recently faced similar challenges -- the total number of agencies declined almost by half from 1997 to 2005, according to the Census Bureau -- the Barofskys decided to close shop and start over.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of running a full-service bricks-and-mortar agency, they now sell only ground tours of Italy over the Internet. The transition, however, was difficult.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Barofskys initially tried to sell their agency but failed. They eventually found a competitor to take over their phone number and employees in exchange for a commission on future sales. Now, operating from home, the Barofskys have drastically cut costs and are slowly building a reputation as experts in one niche.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't sell air; we don't work in any other markets,'' Mr. Barofsky said. ''But whatever you want in Italy, we'll come up with something. It's much more efficient, and we get to keep what we make.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is nothing new about the challenges faced by the Wicks and Barofskys: history is filled with goods and services once deemed indispensable. Experts say, however, that industries mature more quickly now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are certain eras of technology that accelerate the pace at which established companies become outmoded,'' said Mr. Hsu of Wharton, pointing out that the widespread use of electronics for example has pushed many traditional crafts into extinction.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some entrepreneurs, faced with too many challenges, simply switch industries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For over a decade, Dr. Herb Parris ran a family practice in Denver that specialized in sports medicine. As insurance premiums across his industry rose and reimbursement rates dropped, Dr. Parris found himself working longer hours for less pay.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day, after giving a Botox injection and receiving payment from the patient immediately and in full, because insurance was not involved, Dr. Parris realized he could make a much easier living outside of medicine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Dr. Parris bought a spa franchise from Ageless Remedies, and now spends his time administering Botox injections and performing laser hair removal. His income has risen 15 percent in the last two years, he said, and within five years he expects to earn double or triple what he was making as a doctor.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the toughest climates, there are always entrepreneurs who manage to stay afloat.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Gary Stern, a second-generation pinball entrepreneur.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990s, about five companies in the United States sold roughly 100,000 pinball machines a year. Today, only 10,000 new machines are sold annually, all made by Stern Pinball in Chicago.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern, the founder, who started working in the industry as a teenager, said he defied a basic tenet of entrepreneurship to pursue his passion.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They tell you in business school to be in love with business, not your business,'' he said. ''But we're in love with our business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern has tweaked his business many times in pursuit of profits. He designs games based on popular movies to attract customers. He exports to Europe, and markets to men over the age of 45 who want a pinball machine at home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern, 62, said he had no plans to shut down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a mission,'' he said. ''The world would exist without pinball, but we'd lose a little bit of the fabric of life.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For America's small banks, the changing financial landscape of the last decade meant that many opportunities were no longer available. The big national banks went after consumer lending and came to dominate the market for credit cards. Lending to big companies had long since migrated away from local banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was left? Real estate. That included home mortgages, of course, but in that business there was more and more competition from independent mortgage brokers and from national companies that packaged the loans and sold them to investors. The banks' share of such mortgage lending was still large, but it was declining.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, one part of the real estate picture remained dominated by local financial institutions: lending to local land developers. It was a market where local knowledge mattered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result has been a steady increase in commercial real estate loans, particularly loans secured by raw land that a developer plans to build on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the middle of this year, 15 percent of the assets of smaller financial institutions in the United States -- defined as those with less than $1 billion in assets -- were in construction loans, quadruple the proportion a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the banks that were most dependent on that strategy are being questioned by investors -- in some cases to the irritation of bank executives who say they are being tarred by fallout from lending excesses in which they had no part.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything about Colonial is speculation, and rumor and fear,'' Robert E. Lowder, the chief executive of Colonial BancGroup, a bank holding company based in Montgomery, Ala., complained in a conference call this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of Colonial's $15.5 billion in loans, 42 percent are construction loans. Most are in Florida, where the real estate boom has faltered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody's down on Florida,'' Mr. Lowder said. ''Everybody thinks Florida is going to fall into the Gulf of Mexico. Trust me, Florida is still a great place to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive of another bank heavy in construction loans, the Las Vegas-based Community Bancorp, was in New York this week assuring institutional investors that they should not worry. ''We're doing great,'' the executive, Edward M. Jamison, said in an interview. ''We see a lot of vitality in our markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices falling and mortgage delinquencies rising in many areas, banks now feel a need to prove their loans are safe. Mr. Jamison emphasized that his bank lent to commercial, not residential developments, principally strip malls. Mr. Lowder, whose bank does finance residential developments, said it had avoided speculative projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few construction loans are behind in interest payments, but that fact may be less reassuring than it seems, since many such loans do not require payments until the project is completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank regulators are at least a little worried. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation keeps track of banks that are heavily dependent upon commercial real estate loans -- either because construction loans are greater than the capital of the bank or because total commercial real estate loans, including mortgages on commercial properties, are at least three times the bank's capital. By this June, 37 percent of all banks met one or both criteria, triple the figure of a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early last year, the regulators proposed new rules on such loans, but the watered-down policy that finally came out did little more than to warn that ''rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the advent of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the stock market, banks with such concentrations have done a little worse than other banks this year. Short-interest on those stocks is up sharply, a sign that hedge funds think banks will end up owning a lot of vacant real estate, having to pay taxes on land that brings in no income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jamison, the Las Vegas banker, scoffs at such a forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would,'' he told me, ''be almost a perfect storm to have a meltdown in the real estate market.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Business Day on Thursday about companies that are trying to stop junk mail referred incorrectly to the business plans of two of those companies, Stopthejunkmail.com and GreenDimes. The two held no serious discussions about a purchase of Stopthejunkmail.com by GreenDimes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Sep 08 2007    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Pankaj Shah may be the only chief executive in Silicon Valley striving to put himself out of business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is the founder of GreenDimes, a small business with big plans to stop junk mail while aiding the environment. If Mr. Shah has his way, millions of tons of unwanted mail will go the way of pesky phone solicitations. And the planet, not just consumers, he says, will reap the rewards.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GreenDimes is one of several companies nationwide begun in recent years to organize information about a customer's unsolicited credit card offers and money mailers, or no longer desired catalogs, and then perform the legwork to halt the flow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Direct Marketing Association, a trade group of 3,600 direct marketers and mail order companies, reports that marketers will spend nearly $56 billion on direct mail and catalogs in 2007, which will generate an estimated $700 billion in sales. That translates into an average of 26 pieces of mail a week for each household, according to the United States Postal Service's Household Diary of 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody gets junk mail, and nobody likes it,'' Mr. Shah said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company pledges to plant one tree a month for every person who registers. According to the WildWest Institute, an estimated 100 million trees are destroyed each year to produce 4.5 million tons of junk mail, with 44 percent of that thrown away unopened.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GreenDimes keeps a crawl running on its home page,   www.greendimes.com  [http://www.greendimes.com], showing that more than 310,590 trees have been preserved, more than 4 million gallons of water saved and nearly 1.6 million pounds of junk mail stopped by its efforts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shah, 34, decided to ''chase lifestyle dollars instead of charity dollars'' when he opened a parent company named Tonic in August 2006 using wealth he had acquired in the technology industry. He kicked off GreenDimes as Tonic's first endeavor with only himself as a client when he found a stunning amount of junk inside his mailbox.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, GreenDimes has 16 employees who manage accounts for 50,000 members. Many of them signed up after the actor Matt Damon, who sits on the board, promoted the site on ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' and ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the company retooled the Web site to attract a hipper audience by including more content on environmental matters in a section called W.T.F.? (It stands for Want the Facts?) The company expanded its charity choices beyond just environmental matters and has started a petition to create a national do-not-mail list similar to the do-not-call list created by an act of Congress in 2003. The Federal Trade Commission, which administers the list, reports that 148,471,508 phone numbers were signed up as of Aug. 31. As many as 300,000 are added weekly, the commission says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shah hopes to get enough signatures through word of mouth to take his petition to Congress. But staff members of the Senate Commerce Committee point out that junk mail was left out of the 2003 provision because it was considered less intrusive than phone calls or unwanted faxes. They further expressed doubt that a do-not-mail list would be created or would be upheld by the courts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hurdles have not stopped Mr. Shah from, as he calls it, ''stepping on the gas,'' to make GreenDimes more accessible and more competitive. The company -- the name was based on the annual $36 fee, which amounts to a dime a day to stop junk mail -- recently dropped its fee to $15 with a $5 rebate for referrals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price decrease was in part a response to other small businesses also promising to stem the tide of waste while contributing to environmental causes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, three brothers in Ferndale, Mich., started 41 Pounds (  www.41pounds.org  [http://www.41pounds.org]), named for the number of pounds of junk mail the average adult receives every year. So far, 5,000 people have paid $41 for a five-year membership. The company, which recently became a nonprofit organization, donates $15 of that to environmental organizations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site, Stopthejunkmail.com, has 6,000 members and is run by a married couple in Boulder, Colo. It is the only company to provide the service to small businesses. Fees range from $19.95 for an individual up to $90 for a business with 25 employees. For every sign-up, Stopthejunkmail.com donates $1 to American Forests, a nonprofit conservation organization.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also possible to combat junk mail free. Web sites like   www.ecocycle.org  [http://www.ecocycle.org] and   www.obviously.com/junkmail  [http://www.obviously.com/junkmail] will walk you through the necessary steps on how to deal with list brokers and other direct marketing firms that are not part of the Direct Marketing Association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $1, you can also get off any new customer lists through the mail preferences of the Direct Marketing Association (The-DMA.org). The association says it accepts post cards, available from many third party organizations, that consumers can individually sign and send in with their $1. It is also in discussions with GreenDimes to accept the registrations of their individual members.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To use an analogy, you can wash your own car or pay someone to wash it at a carwash,'' said Stephanie Hendricks, director for public affairs at the association. ''These companies are certainly complementary, doing things you can do. You're paying for time and convenience.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shah is gambling that a user-friendly process coupled with a charitable ethos will attract more users around the globe. Tudor Investment, a venture capital firm based in Boston, recently invested $20.5 million in GreenDimes, according to Mr. Shah. Tudor declined to comment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GreenDimes has completed a test for expanding to Canada and plans to offer its service in Britain as early as this fall. And Bill Brown, owner of Stopthejunkmail.com, says he is considering selling his site to Mr. Shah.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these expansion plans, Mr. Shah says he sees no reason junk mail cannot be eradicated by more than the 75 percent to 90 percent most companies promise, even if that means the end of a small business like GreenDimes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want this to be a small bet, meaning getting a few hundred thousand people signed up by next year,'' Mr. Shah said. ''I'd rather figure out how to get five million and make it viral and a little bit renegade. We actually are going to try to put ourselves out of business because the win in the end is that people actually have to ask for this stuff instead of getting it thrown at them.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO better to understand the software that a small-business owner needs to run a company than another small-business owner?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such thinking was the inspiration behind NetBooks, a software company introduced this month by Ridgely Evers, the owner of DaVero Sonoma, a farm in Healdsburg, Calif., that produces olive oils and artisanal wines.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most larger companies don't understand this market,'' Mr. Evers said. ''They don't respect it. How in the world can they serve it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the design driven by Mr. Evers, NetBooks, of Rohnert Park, Calif., has released software applications for what it calls ''true small businesses,'' the 5.1 million or so owner-operated, self-financed companies that employ 2 to 50 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His own experience running DaVero shaped Mr. Evers's conviction that small businesses need something other than watered-down versions of applications designed for much larger companies by executives and developers who have never been entrepreneurs themselves. It helps that Mr. Evers is the brains behind the original QuickBooks accounting software, giving him experience as a software entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The companies we're targeting are profitable from Day 1 because they have to be or they're gone,'' he said. ''If you're designing a service for the true small business, you choose ease of use. You don't choose simplistic. You choose simple.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy use was behind Mr. Evers's decision to deliver NetBooks applications through the Internet rather than sell them at office-supply stores. The service is tailored for entrepreneurs who do not have the luxury of turning to staff technology experts to get set up and who need access to their financial and operating data from virtually anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the day-to-day tasks that NetBooks addresses are sales and customer relationship management; inventory, production and shipping tasks; and bookkeeping and financial reports. The service costs $200 a month for up to five users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The process of learning about the service was very interactive and positive,'' said Paul Rosen, who owns Paromi Tea in Bethesda, Md., and is a NetBooks customer. ''I saw that it could do everything I needed it to do. The customer service is amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the application was Web-based was a major reason Mr. Rosen chose it. ''It allows me to be completely mobile and stay on top of everything,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NetBooks is not alone in thinking that small-business owners are more likely to buy services developed from their perspective and that the Internet is an efficient way to deliver them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take YourCostCenter.com. Brian Drucks, the president of the service, developed the application to determine a more precise way to price jobs for his fourth-generation contract-painting business in Mendham, N.J. As he began describing the application to business contacts, they helped him realize the service could work for accountants, contractors, architects, graphic designers and other professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people set prices at the beginning of the year, but when their expenses change, they don't adjust them,'' Mr. Drucks said. His service ''allows you to recover those variable expenses that slip through the cracks,'' he added. ''You can make an educated decision versus making a decision based solely on your gut.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YourCostCenter.com will calculate adjustments in job costs to offset possible losses. It costs $199 a year for one to five people and $399 for six or more. Mr. Drucks said he offered the application over the Internet for two reasons: first, most small-business owners he knows rely on getting their e-mail this way and are comfortable paying a subscription; second, it is easier for him to add features. ''As a Web-hosted package, it never has to be complete,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Arnie Bellini, the chief executive of ConnectWise, an information technology services company in Tampa, Fla., the decision to offer his own operations management software to peer companies was a revelation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While discussing the possibility of selling his company about 10 years ago, Mr. Bellini spoke to potential buyers who said they were astonished by his 40 percent profit margin. They told him that many of his competitors said they earned average profit margins of about 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and the potential buyers realized that the difference was the business methods that ConnectWise had adopted because of its software, Mr. Bellini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We started going to our friends in the industry to tell them about it,'' he said. ''They literally demanded that they get a copy of our software. They told us we had to sell it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was ConnectWisePSA, which the company sells as an Internet service for $50 a month per user, or as a $750 packaged product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say software companies like NetBooks and ConnectWise play to the diversity of small businesses by avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Speyer of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who focuses on information technology issues affecting small businesses, said that many high-tech companies segment potential customers by the number of employees they have, overlooking the concerns of entrepreneurs versus those of corporate managers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, NetBooks considers factors like how active the owner is as a manager, how much daily control he or she requires, the owner's attitude toward using technology and whether a venture capital company has invested money in the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like the fact that NetBooks has taken a psychographic approach to finding out who their customers are and what they really want,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''This is really what counts. I think the way they characterize the market is spot-on. Stages of development are really what counts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonal Gandhi, an analyst with JupiterResearch in New York, said that small businesses were more open to using an application developed by one of their own. ''There is certain functionality they crave,'' she said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LYNNE KILLEY followed the advice books when she opened a spa and started producing a line of natural skin care products out of her home in Pagosa Springs, Colo.: she tried to make her one-woman operation look bigger.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I referred to the company in the third person,'' she said. ''I made a logo, Stella, and sometimes billed things out under Stella's name.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, last summer, Ms. Killey's publicist organized a trip to New York so she could meet with magazine editors. In describing her business, Queen Bee Skin Care, Ms. Killey revealed that she made her products in her own kitchen. Even as she spoke, she said, she realized that perhaps her home-based model was a selling point and not something to hide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here I was sitting in front of people that I needed to impress, and they just loved that I was making the stuff in my kitchen,'' she said. Right about then, she rethought her strategy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about 50 percent of businesses in the United States based out of the home, this kind of transparency is likely to become more common. ''Place honestly doesn't matter anymore,'' said Maggie Jackson, author of ''What's Happening to Home'' (Sorin Books 2002).   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is no longer a faux pas to have a life at the other end of the telephone line.'' Ms. Jackson said. ''It can make you feel like you're dealing with a holistic person. And it is just another sign that we are moving away from the industrial age in that we no longer have two totally separate spheres called work and home.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as customers, vendors and other outsiders are getting a chance to peek behind the curtain into home offices, home-based entrepreneurs are also getting more opportunities to interact with each other. StartupNation, an online hub for small businesses, is running a contest, the Home-Based 100, that will rank home-based businesses according to various criteria, including ''the top financial performers,'' ''the greenest,'' ''the wackiest'' and ''boomers back in business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home-based businesses are out of the hiding part, but when we talk about business, we still talk about the Fortune 500, but not the half-trillion dollar economy of home-based businesses,'' said Richard Sloan, co-founder of StartupNation. ''This new community will also allow home-based businesses to connect with each other, get inspired and share best practices.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Elam, the founder and choreographer of Misnomer Dance Theater, runs the company out of his Brooklyn apartment, and he is a big proponent of transparency. His company videotapes rehearsals and even office meetings for posting on its video blog, which allows audiences to get a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to run a dance company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dance audiences traditionally interact with a dance company for only two hours a year and maybe get a couple of postcards,'' Mr. Elam said. ''But so much happens outside the performance, and we are trying to find ways of making the whole function of the company more open-source.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margot J. Tohn is another home-based business owner who thinks there is no point in hiding. Her decision to start a publishing business came after a disastrous evening of trying to find parking in the theater district in Manhattan. She thought she would write a book about finding parking in New York, and since she was staying in her childhood home in Larchmont, N.Y., it made sense to start her business there to keep her start-up costs low. She could also store books in the garage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book, ''Park It! NYC'', is now in its second edition. She also works as a consultant for small financial advisers serving affluent families.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the same time she started her business, Ms. Tohn, 43, and her two sisters bought the house from their parents, who had moved to Florida for their retirement. Even with this rather unusual housing arrangement, Ms. Tohn says she has found that being candid often worked to her advantage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the local bookstore runs out of my book, I can easily run some over,'' she said. ''My consulting clients know that I am unusually accessible. It isn't uncommon for a client to call at 8 or 9 in the evening. It used to happen at 7 in the morning, but we put a stop to that.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients also know that she often leaves the office midday to play tennis or tend to her garden, and leaves the cellphone behind. ''When you start work 10 minutes after waking up, it's healthy to take real breaks.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Tohn does not want to confuse her openness with a lack of professionalism. When she brings in a team of interns to help with a project, she sets them up in dining room where everyone can spread out around the table. ''It's all about creating a separate area from where I live,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is also a stickler about noise. ''I've learned from watching my two sisters keep home offices while raising their children,'' she said. ''When the door is shut to the office, it is shut, and they can't be interrupted unless it's blood or death.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra M. Cohen, 40, by contrast, says she designed her business, a contractor referral service for homeowners, around the idea that she might be on the phone for business and her children might be making a ruckus in the background. Her company, Home Remedies of New York, has become so successful, she says, that she now offers consulting services to others who want to copy her business model in their communities. Ms. Cohen says she has home referral operators running her programs in nearly every state and Canada.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When exploring ideas for a business, she ran every idea through the ''can it be done from home with kids underfoot'' test, she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from home may allow for certain informalities, but it does not necessarily signal the size of an entrepreneur's vision. Ms. Cohen's business passed the million-dollar revenue mark four years after its founding. Bradley Rhine, 46, who works out of his home in San Jose, Calif., is a chief executive of Cogentes, a virtual consulting firm specializing in the information technology industry. Cogentes plans to hire 100 to 200 employees over the next several years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has nine employees, in Atlanta, San Jose and Boston, and as it expands it does not consider where a person lives. ''Our ongoing proposition as to find the best people wherever they are,'' Mr. Rhine said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his firm's business model makes sense because it is now possible to outsource many aspects of a business's operations. The company uses outside firms for payroll, benefits, human resources, recruiting and marketing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one commutes, and everyone can live where they want, he said. ''It is just a ridiculous waste of time and resources. It is both wasteful and stressful,'' he added. ''Plus, it is bad for the environment.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, after losing a Congressional race, Barack Obama was looking to revive his political fortunes. And he soon found a springboard -- a group of black entrepreneurs also trying to break out.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month after month, Mr. Obama, then an Illinois state senator, showed up at the Chicago group's meetings, listening to members' concerns about the difficulties they faced in getting government and corporate business, and asking them what he could do to help.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And help them he did. Members of the group, the Alliance of Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs, say Mr. Obama checked into their problems and helped start a drive that enabled minority investment executives to win millions of dollars in business from the state's giant pension funds.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Obama was able to deliver by helping the executives overcome some of the historical barriers facing minority-owned companies, he also would subsequently benefit from his ties to the group. Several of the businessmen or their wives would help clear the debts from his Congressional race, and six of the group's members are now among the top fund-raisers for his presidential campaign, according to campaign finance records.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, employees at more than 30 of the 42 companies listed on the group's Web site and their relatives donated more than $300,000 to help Mr. Obama win his seat in the United States Senate in 2004 and set fund-raising records early in the 2008 presidential race.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his presidential campaign, Mr. Obama has been running on a platform of reducing the influence of money in politics. But with Mr. Obama, as with every politician, money has been the blood flow of his campaigns. And at a critical point in his career, he greatly expanded an early pillar of his fund-raising network while trying to help the black entrepreneurs secure work with the state.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The senator's courtship of the Chicago group and its members is a little-known chapter in his political development that shows the inextricable link between money and politics and the different interpretations people attach to it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Stewart, executive director of an Illinois watchdog group known as the Better Government Association, said that in helping these and other executives as a state senator, Mr. Obama also benefited from the kind of special-interest-driven politics he now decries.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Raising large chunks from special interests was common in Illinois,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''Obama did that too. Now he's talking about chasing away special interests; that's great. But that doesn't change the past.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama says his involvement with the alliance reflects his longtime passion for ensuring that minority businesses are treated fairly, and there is no indication that he helped the businessmen simply to secure their donations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The suggestion that these pioneering leaders would need my help or anyone's help in order to succeed is troubling, to say the least,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement. ''I'm proud that I've spent my career fighting to ensure that minority-owned businesses would have a chance to compete, and I will continue to do so as president.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama also recently pointed to his work on the Illinois pension issue as a model for what he would do as president to promote minority-owned companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that push, Mr. Obama met with three state pension boards and introduced a bill on the executives' behalf. He also worked closely with the state's top legislative leaders to encourage the pension funds to increase the share of their investment portfolios managed by minority-owned firms. That share has risen to 12 to 20 percent now from 1 to 3 percent in 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other alliance members said Mr. Obama also looked into whether they could get state business in other areas, including legal work on bond issues and the printing of official notices. As Stephen H. Pugh, a lawyer who belongs to the group, said, ''He wanted to understand what our needs were and how government could help.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama, Mr. Pugh said, ''would be our representative -- our advocate -- to bring our views back to state government.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alliance was founded in 1992 to help Chicago's top black executives and entrepreneurs share business tips and push for greater opportunities. According to the group's Web site, the companies -- which also include architecture, engineering, transportation and communications firms -- average 65 full-time employees and annual revenues of $19 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal was always ''to open up doors,'' said John W. Rogers Jr., the chief executive of Ariel Capital Management, one of the investment firms that received state business. ''It was, as the Rev. Jesse Jackson has eloquently put it, to force other industries to have their 'Jackie Robinson' moment.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its early years, the group's main political patron was State Senator Emil Jones Jr., who later became the State Senate president and one of Mr. Obama's chief mentors. In 1993, Mr. Jones took the first crack at opening up the pension business, persuading the Legislature to pass a bill encouraging the multibillion-dollar funds to use minority-owned firms ''to the greatest extent feasible.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the time Mr. Obama, then a junior state senator, began meeting regularly with the group in 2000, little progress had been made. As a result, said Hermene Hartman, the alliance president, the pension issues got ''a lot of attention'' in the discussions with Mr. Obama.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment firms were also among the largest and most prominent companies in the group, and some of their executives were among Mr. Obama's closest friends.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogers, who also sits on the boards of the McDonald's Corporation and other major companies, played basketball at Princeton University with Mr. Obama's brother-in-law. James Reynolds Jr., the chief executive of Loop Capital, a brokerage firm, had been a top fund-raiser for Mr. Obama's Congressional race.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogers said the investment managers also solicited support from Michael J. Madigan, the powerful Democratic speaker of the Illinois House. In 2001 and 2002, Mr. Madigan and Mr. Obama -- at times joined by the investment executives -- made formal pitches before three of the state pension boards.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after Mr. Jones became the State Senate president in 2003, he assigned Mr. Obama to a committee looking into the pension questions to help raise his political profile.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During this period, campaign finance records show, executives from Ariel, Loop and two other leading Chicago investment firms, Holland Capital Management and Capri Capital, sharply increased their donations to Mr. Obama's State Senate campaign fund. And once he began his campaign for the United States Senate, they quickly became a fund-raising core that has carried over into the presidential race.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogers, who is one of three people at his company who have each bundled at least $50,000 in donations for Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, said that his financial support for the senator had ''no connection'' to his company's efforts to win state contracts, but that it reflected the broader excitement over what Mr. Obama's success meant for blacks in America.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pointing to his parents' struggles to break into the legal business in Chicago, Mr. Rogers said that pushing for greater opportunities was ''in your blood, and when you have a peer come along like Barack, who is your own age and lives in your neighborhood, you can't wait to help him.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reynolds of Loop Capital, who is also one of the bundlers in Mr. Obama's presidential campaign, did not return calls for comment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, Mr. Obama dropped off the State Senate committee in late 2003 as his United States Senate race heated up, and just as the panel began a series of hearings that produced the most substantial changes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, William Atwood, the director of the Illinois State Board of Investment, said Mr. Obama regularly asked about minority participation in the pension funds when their paths crossed. ''He would ask: 'How are we doing? Are we making progress?''' Mr. Atwood recalled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes have generated several million dollars in fees for some of the investment firms, although the complete totals could not be obtained. Loop Capital, for instance, saw its brokerage fees related to one of the pension funds shoot up to $2.4 million last year from just $5,700 in 2001. All told, Loop Capital received $5 million in fees from managers for that fund over those six years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, things have not worked out as well for some of the investment managers. Both Ariel and Holland were given several hundred million dollars to invest. But one of the funds dropped Ariel and two dropped Holland last year after their investment returns lagged behind those of other firms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rogers, the Ariel chief executive, said his firm's value-oriented stocks tended to lag in fast-rising markets, and other state funds say they are sticking with Ariel for now because it has produced impressive long-term returns. Officials at Holland declined to comment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Rogers also complained that the Illinois funds, which are free to hire minority managers from anywhere in the country, have given much of their business to out-of-state firms owned by women and Asian-Americans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Mr. Obama recently told the Urban League that if he was elected president he would use the same model in helping black-owned businesses nationwide as he did on the pension issue, Mr. Rogers said, ''Actually, it is a model of how hard it is to get sustained traction.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the talk about how nimble entrepreneurs are, Murphy's Law can test even the most nimble. And the question that invariably comes up at such times is this: ''Is it worth it?''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is often out-of-control debt, which pushes the business to the brink of bankruptcy -- and the entrepreneurs to the dreaded fate of reporting to a boss in somebody else's company. The vast majority of entrepreneurs I have talked to over the years said finding financing was their biggest, and often perpetual, challenge.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitalism thrives on failure, of course. The Small Business Administration estimates that 545,000 companies with employees shut their doors in 2005 (the latest year for which figures are available). That comes to more than 10,000 a week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the story of one owner who, against all odds, kept his company open.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murphy's Law states that if something can go wrong, it will. The architectural and ornamental metalworking company that Richard Lodato and his wife, Marie, started in 1996 when they were in their early 20s had ups and downs from the start -- so many that Mr. Lodato says he has lost track of most of them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the venture, Forerunner Creations, grew steadily, graduating from restoration work at homes in Brooklyn to more lucrative jobs in West Village brownstones in the shadow of the World Trade Center.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murphy's Law threw its first punch in 2001. ''Just as we were getting on our feet, we got thrown out of the Brooklyn building where I had my shop,'' said Mr. Lodato, now 35. He says he compounded that setback by spending more than he should have to buy a 4,000-square-foot building and stock it with expensive machinery.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Murphy's Law struck again, with a vengeance. The closing was scheduled for Sept. 11. Though it was postponed for a week, Mr. Lodato said he knew that his thriving trade in Lower Manhattan would be on hold indefinitely.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he remained confident that he could make a go of it, even after Mrs. Lodato gave birth to their son, Daniel, in October 2003 and ended her active role in the company. By then, the couple had $370,000 in debt, most of it on credit cards. Even so, Mr. Lodato struggled on, scraping up enough work to make the payments on time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, Murphy's Law delivered what appeared to be the knockout blow. In late June 2004, Mr. Lodato learned that he had a tumor the size of a golf ball in his cerebellum. ''It had to be taken out, and fast,'' he said. ''It was cutting the flow of spinal fluid. I thought I wasn't going to make it to my next birthday.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turned out, the growth was less malignant than most brain tumors, and the operation was successful. But Mr. Lodato was out sick for four months, a potentially fatal loss of time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Life pounds at you,'' he said. ''You work 12 hours a day. We built this company from the bottom up with our blood, sweat and tears. Now, we thought we were going to lose it.'' It didn't help that several workers he had trained in the metalworking craft took one look at his gaunt appearance, his hobbling walk and the titanium plate screwed into his head, and abandoned him.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife called the company's creditors to plead for time. A few were sympathetic, but still wanted their money. For the first time, the couple felt defeated.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We considered declaring bankruptcy, calling it quits, going to work for a big company,'' Mr. Lodato said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, they pressed on, looking for new sources of financing. Mr. Lodato filled out a questionnaire he stumbled across on the Internet, thinking it was for a bank loan. Instead, it was an application for a consultation with a company called Corporate Turnaround in Paramus, N.J.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Silberman, the founder of Corporate Turnaround, started out as the owner of a commercial collection agency, but says he realized most entrepreneurs who fell behind on payments were not deadbeats. As a result, he says, he developed a system for helping honest but desperate business owners climb out of their financial hole.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, he calculates the maximum sum of money they can afford to pay creditors each month and still stay in business. Then, using software he has refined over the years, he negotiates settlements with all creditors, based on variables like how vital they are to the troubled company's survival and whether they want a lump sum immediately or are willing to spread out the repayments. He cuts clients' debt burdens by 60 percent on average, he says. He also takes out a hefty commission on the savings, and charges other fees.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're strict,'' he says. ''We're disciplined. The idea is to relieve the stress.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was what most appealed to Mr. Lodato.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It freed me to run my business instead of constantly putting out fires,'' he said. ''Before they came along, every day, I had to wonder, 'Who's coming after me today?' ''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2005, Mr. Lodato authorized Mr. Silberman's company to draft $4,878 out of his bank account every month to go into a pool to pay creditors and Corporate Turnaround's fees. The company negotiated settlements totaling $101,000 out of $210,000 in debt, and collected commissions and fees of $41,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lodato was able to end the program sooner than expected after getting financial help from a relative, enabling him to pay off the remaining creditors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What did he learn from his near fiasco? A lesson that is both obvious and widely ignored by overstretched entrepreneurs: Create a contingency plan for financing and managing your business in case something happens to you.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects to be around for a while, though. On Jan. 19, his daughter, Rebecca, was born -- an event the couple had postponed ''until I convinced myself I'd live long enough to raise my kids,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mr. Lodata says he has more work than he can handle, including a $250,000 project on a restaurant in a landmark building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. He is hoping to find a partner who will invest $300,000 in the business and handle the paperwork, so he can devote his time to building Forerunner Creations into what he is confident could become a multimillion-dollar company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It baffles me what some people will spend on their homes,'' he says. ''But thank God they're out there.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, Larry Blansett was producing a wide array of prescription cough syrups, antihistamine tablets and pain killers at the company he co-founded, UAD Laboratories. But the Food and Drug Administration was not keeping a close watch.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blansett continues to sell the same range of products at his latest venture, the Blansett Pharmacal Company, which employs about 90 people in North Little Rock, Ark. ''We grew gradually at first, but are now a national company,'' he said.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, the F.D.A. has begun to crack down on the thousands of drugs that have never had to go through the agency's stringent approval process, many of them made by small companies like Blansett Pharmacal. And those companies are crying foul.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The F.D.A. has never required these products to be regulated as new drugs,'' Mr. Blansett said. ''It has no regard for the cost or damage they do to small businesses. There are estimates that only a few of us will make it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency says it is only doing what it must do. ''This is a public health initiative,'' said Deborah A. Autor, director of the Office of Compliance at the F.D.A.'s Center of Drug Evaluation and Research. ''Some of these drugs may not be safe. In all likelihood, these companies knew from Day 1 that they were producing illegal drugs.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To counter the agency's crackdown, a trade group representing about 50 small to medium-size companies has submitted a bill to Congress that would create a cheaper and simpler process for gaining F.D.A. approval. Mr. Blansett claimed the cost could run up to $5 million for a new drug application.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perry Cole, executive director of the Branded Pharmaceutical Association, says several members of Congress have expressed support for the legislation. ''I'm confident it will be introduced,'' Mr. Cole said. He said these drugs -- the makers call them legacy drugs and define them as drugs that have been prescribed for at least 25 years and have gained a history for safety and efficacy -- were far safer than many prescription drugs of recent vintage, like Viagra, which he said had been associated with hundreds of premature deaths.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Pitts, president of the nonprofit Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and a former F.D.A. associate commissioner, said the issue was complicated. ''Many of these drugs were grandfathered in when the current approval process was instituted,'' he said. ''However, that doesn't give these companies carte blanche -- they still have to play by the rules.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group that he founded with Ralph Nader, takes a less benign view of the legacy drug makers, but he reserves his firepower for big pharmaceutical companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The laws have to be enforced,'' he said, but the F.D.A. ''goes for the easy targets,'' adding that ''the collective harm all these small companies have done pales by comparison with just one or two unregulated products sold by bigger companies.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The F.D.A.'s priorities should be set according to the potential harm to the public,'' Mr. Wolfe said. He contended that the agency had failed to act forcefully against big corporations because of their deep pockets and political clout and noted that these same corporations pay most of the cost of the drug reviews.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency began its campaign against the makers of unapproved drugs in June 2006, and immediately began ordering companies that made products that it deemed potentially hazardous to file new drug applications or take them off the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, for example, it told firms to stop making unapproved products containing quinine, which has been used since the 1600s to treat malaria. The one company that made an approved quinine product, Qualaquin, was the Mutual Pharmaceutical Company of Philadelphia, and the F.D.A's action, in effect, granted Mutual a temporary monopoly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the agency ordered drug makers to stop selling unapproved forms of guaifenesin, an expectorant and cough suppressant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, the agency said it would take enforcement action against companies that sold unapproved cough suppressants containing hydrocodone, a drug that dates back to the 1940s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Autor, of the F.D.A., said only seven of more than 200 hydrocodone cough suppressants on the market had the agency's approval. ''One reason hydrocodone is a safety concern is because it is a narcotic, and in some cases has been labeled for use by children as young as 2,'' she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blansett said that his company produces two products containing guaifenesin and that he planned to stopping making both, at a cost of $2 million in annual sales. But, he added, he will do whatever he can to keep selling hydrocodone medications, which account for more than half his company's annual revenue.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.D.A.'s demand that small drug makers file new drug applications was unrealistic, he said, because most could not afford the $5 million cost. ''You won't see any small companies out there anymore if the F.D.A. gets its way,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Autor acknowledged that the legal offensive poses difficult challenges for small drug makers, but she vowed to continue. ''There are a few thousand unapproved drugs out there,'' she said. ''So far, the F.D.A. has taken action against approximately 500.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of unapproved drugs has been going on for so long ''in part because companies have used the laws' grandfather provisions as a cloak to cover illegal marketing,'' Ms. Autor said. ''The agency has been working on the unapproved drugs problem steadily through the years,'' she said, but has ''decided to tackle the issue once and for all.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drug makers, she said, had been put ''on specific notice for at least four years that we intended to increase our emphasis on the issue.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mr. Blansett, small companies like his historically have been exempt from the rigorous trials that the F.D.A. requires for new drugs. Drugs like guaifenesin, which was used by Native Americans at least as far back as the 1500s, are aimed at relieving symptoms like sneezing, headaches and pain, not at curing disease, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vioxx and other new drugs have to go through study after study with tests on 500 to 5,000 patients,'' he said. ''But legacy drugs have been used for many, many years on millions and millions of people.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Autor said the agency did not recognize the term ''legacy drugs.'' Many had been introduced recently, she said, and many of their labels listed unapproved uses. She cited versions of carbinoxamine, an antihistamine also used for colds, that were labeled for use on children as young as one month and that have been associated with 21 infant deaths.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blansett said he thought that the F.D.A. had exaggerated the adverse reactions of legacy drugs on children and said he would be happy to conform to any labeling changes the F.D.A. requested. ''Why not just work with us?'' he asked.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pitts, of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, said he was sympathetic to Mr. Blansett's appeal for the agency to work more closely with small drug makers. ''The earlier you can get all parties to the table, including manufacturers, the better,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some drugs singled out by the agency's recent crackdown have already become much more expensive, according to the Branded Pharmaceutical Association. Mutual Pharmaceutial, for example, charges $385.13 for 100 Qualaquin tablets, each containing 324 milligrams of quinine sulfate, compared with $6 for 100 equivalent tablets that used to be available from other drug makers, the association said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mutual said the higher costs resulted from the ''millions of dollars'' it had spent to improve the safety of its quinine product.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the small drug makers and the F.D.A. remain at loggerheads. ''Why is she doing this?'' Mr. Blansett asked of the regulatory campaign. To which Ms. Autor replied, ''It is not something that happened out of the blue.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 -- Representative Jason Altmire, a Pennsylvania Democrat, says he was just trying to help the small technology companies blossoming in his district, just north of Pittsburgh.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when two of his constituents argued that small businesses should be able to qualify for federal research grants without being penalized for accepting venture capital money, he agreed to introduce legislation that would help them.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His bill, the Small Business Expansion Act of 2007, sailed through the Small Business Committee and then the full House of Representatives on a 325-to-73 vote last month. But the House adopted an important change as the measure came up for a vote -- it specified that a small business could not give up an ownership stake of ''50 percent or more'' to a venture capital firm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amendment was meant to satisfy critics, among them officials of the Small Business Administration who argued that allowing venture capitalists to pour unlimited amounts of money into these fledgling businesses would fundamentally alter the concept of a small -- and independent -- business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the legislation awaits Senate action, opponents argue that the amendment did not resolve their concerns. The S.B.A., they say, has long had discretion in determining whether venture capital's support of a small business represents an investment or whether it crosses the line into control of the company. The legislation, they say, takes away that discretion by spelling out a particular percentage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the critics say they fear that the bill will clear the way for venture capital firms to use their investment to take a controlling stake, giving them the potential to masquerade as small firms and tap into billions of dollars in federal research grants and contracts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is an important and sensitive argument at a time when the government has been criticized for awarding contracts to large corporations operating under the guise of small businesses. Edsel M. Brown Jr., assistant director for S.B.A.'s office of technology, said the legislation was unnecessary because ''a venture capital company already can invest more than 49 percent as long as it doesn't have ownership and control.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House also opposes the measure. ''The provision would allow large businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and colleges and universities,'' a White House statement said, ''to own and control small businesses and benefit from programs designed for independent small businesses.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite the contrary, Representative Altmire insists, saying that his bill ''does not favor any small business over another, but it also does not automatically disqualify a small business either.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He argues that the legislation is needed because many tech start-ups are ''told by the Small Business Administration that they are ineligible for government money because they got venture capital money -- and that doesn't make any sense.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies doing research in biomedical and military fields say they should receive government research funds on the basis of the quality of their work, not on how they are financed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biotechnology companies, for example, typically take years to generate revenues, which means they often have difficulty getting bank loans. So they turn to venture capital to survive, Scott Koenig, president and chief executive of MacroGenics, told the House Small Business Committee at a hearing in September on the measure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill ''would modernize the S.B.A.'s rules defining a small business so that small biotechnology firms are not prevented from accessing assistance and grants simply because venture capital is part of the business model,'' Mr. Koenig said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Giovanni Coratolo, the small-business director at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the bill created ''a loophole that would allow large businesses, colleges and universities to own an unlimited number of small businesses, but still fall under the definition of small business to access government resources and programs.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a business passes S.B.A. muster as a small business, it can qualify for certain federal programs. For example, biotechnology firms are eligible for grants from the National Institutes of Health, which parcels out more than $22 billion annually to small and big businesses. Other government agencies also award research money, with the largest being the Defense Department, which has about $1 billion a year for small-business research.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerard J. McGarrity said his former firm, Intronn, in Gaithersburg, Md., now owned by the Virxsys Corporation, ended up shutting down promising cystic fibrosis research in 2003 when the federal government cut off funds because Intronn had accepted venture capital investment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The private money was needed to keep going,'' he said, ''but the cutoff of federal funds wiped out our research team.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biotechnology industry said N.I.H. statistics showed how the current classification system was squeezing research. Since 2004, there has been a 25 percent decline in the number of applications for its research funds, according to Congressional testimony by N.I.H. last June. And last year, only 26 percent of the applicants were new, the lowest percentage ever recorded for new research applications.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the National Small Business Association, which opposes the legislation, maintained that small businesses financed with venture capital were faring well under government medical grants. An April 2006 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the percentage of N.I.H. research dollars awarded to these companies had risen to 21 percent in 2004 from 14 percent in 2001, the association said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Small Business League and other foes have also questioned how the legislation would affect eligibility for government contracts. By law, about 23 percent of government contracts are supposed to go to small businesses.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN as oil prices surge, the housing market contracts, Wall Street reels and multibillion-dollar deals falter, small businesses are flourishing and, in fact, are helping to buoy the economy, experts say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, for example, a monthly report released jointly by  <span class="companylink">Automatic Data Processing Inc.</span>, the nation's largest provider of payroll services, and Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting firm, showed an increase in private sector employment in October of 106,000. That included a surge of 63,000 at businesses with fewer than 50 employees, a gain of 50,000 at businesses with 50 to 499 employees -- and a loss of 7,000 at companies with more than 500 employees.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I travel a lot and speak to a lot of small business groups,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers. ''What I hear is much more upbeat than what you read in the financial press. Small business owners know about the worries hanging over Wall Street. But they are doing well. Interest rates are low, the stock market is high. They can raise money. The global economy is very strong. They can expand their global reach, and they are doing it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest numbers marked an acceleration in job growth from an average of 43,000 over the previous three months, Mr. Prakken said. During that time, small businesses were also the main engine of job creation, he added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl Schramm, an economist who is chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City. Mo., and author of ''The Entrepreneurial Imperative,'' said the figures indicate that the role of small businesses as an engine of job growth is gaining force, especially in troubled economic times.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the last recession, young and small businesses created fewer jobs than they do today,'' Mr. Schramm said. ''In the next recession, the power of small businesses to create jobs counter-cyclically will be stronger,'' in part because of the inroads they have made over the last decade into the services sector and the global economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Prakken said the latest A.D.P. report, the only large-scale national study that breaks down results by company size on a monthly basis, ''answers the burning question of the day: are the housing crisis and the August seizure of the credit markets spilling over into the broader economy? The answer seems to be no.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Enos, co-founder and chief executive of StudyPoint, a Boston tutoring company, says he believes he has found a niche neglected by the big companies in the industry. ''We want to build the nation's most successful private in-home tutoring services company,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Enos said he had just hired two people, bringing his full-time staff to 32, from 23 a year ago, and planned to hire two more soon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He projects revenue growth of 31 percent this year, to $4.2 million, and 66 percent next year, to about $7 million. He said he hoped to expand to 30 or 40 cities, up from 10 today. ''We're really trying to ramp up our growth,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is Paul Borgman, co-founder and chief executive of the Smoothstone IP Communications Corporation, a business communications services company in Louisville, Ky. He said he had doubled his work force to 100 over the last year and expected to add 40 more employees by this time next year. He said he also planned to open offices in 12 more cities in 2008, up from 7 today.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, he expects revenue to continue doubling every three years. ''Our sales funnel has never been more robust,'' he said. ''The prospects coming into our funnel have never been more dynamic. We see no effects of an economic slowdown.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report released last week suggests some decline in confidence among small-business owners, but it also contained encouraging signs. The Discover Small Business Watch, based on a monthly survey of 1,000 business owners with fewer than five employees, showed modest declines in the percentage who thought economic conditions for their businesses were improving and who planned to increase investments. The survey also found a bigger drop in the number who planned to hire more workers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers, though, were ''not as sharp as one might anticipate given the overall gloom'' about the economy today, said Sastry Rachakonda, director of Discover Financial Service's small-business credit card unit, which publishes the poll.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the most important indicator, the portion of respondents who reported cash flow problems, declined to 42 percent, from 46 percent in September, he said. While that was higher than 34 percent a year ago, Mr. Rachakonda said, it showed that the sector was weathering the current economic storms well.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the cash flow numbers continue in the same trend, the small business economy will be fine,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest jobs report from  <span class="companylink">Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas</span>, an outplacement firm in Chicago, also pointed to a more buoyant economy than headlines about depressed housing and stock declines would seem to augur.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of planned cuts by employers declined for the second consecutive month in October, to 63,100, from 71,700 in September and 69,200 in October 2006, the survey said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is definitely a positive report,'' said John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, last Friday, the online payroll service SurePayroll released a survey showing that both hiring and salaries at small businesses were up in October.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason small businesses may be outpacing big corporations in the uncertain environment is that they are run by entrepreneurs who are known for their knack of spotting money-making opportunities and acting quickly on them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've thrived on a formula for medium-sized enterprises that nobody else has come up with,'' Mr. Borgman, of Smoothstone, said, which he said was to provide and manage customized phone equipment and telecommunications systems for his clients at all their locations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We save our clients more money than our competitors could, and we save them headaches because we offer a single solution,'' he said. ''This resonates even in this economic environment, when companies' budgets and hiring are not as robust as they were one or two years ago.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John-Claude Hallak, vice president for sales and marketing of Hallak Cleaners, an upscale dry cleaner founded by his father, recently spent $250,000 to refurbish his store in Manhattan, $100,000 to upgrade the exterior of his 12,000-square-foot plant in Hackensack, N.J., $60,000 for a Green Earth Cleaning machine and $40,000 to add a truck to his fleet. He plans to invest $100,000 for an automated assembly and bagging system and $100,000 to $500,000 on improvements at his Hackensack building.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had expanded service in Manhattan and planned on hiring at least two more people. He foresees steady revenue growth of 10 to 15 percent a year for the rest of this decade, a modest rate, by his reckoning. ''I believe strongly in the tortoise and the hare,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hallak pursues an age-old business strategy of aiming at the highest end of the market, which by definition is limited but, he says, is also very loyal. ''For most of the industry, it's a commodities business, very price sensitive,'' he said. Not so for people with $12,000 dresses or $30,000 wedding gowns that need cleaning.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I track everything,'' he said. ''I can tell you every time you had your powder blue suit cleaned and what other items you brought in with it. I can see whether accounts are lapsing and what kind. You can gain all sorts of insights. If the percentage of high-end products weget slips to 50 percent from 60 percent, but overall business increases, that means more people are doing one-stop shopping.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS, Nov. 11 -- With less than 48 hours until one of this city's favorite but rarest of spectacles, the principal players stood around a long table on Sunday morning readying their props and showing no traces of stage fright.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, maybe just a little, considering that the Loizeaux clan still had to finish threading several hundred eight-inch sticks of dynamite with yellow ignition rope and race through the stripped-down carcass of the New Frontier Hotel-Casino stuffing the explosives into the correct pillars.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got a lot to do,'' said Mark Loizeaux, 58, whose wife, son, two daughters and a daughter's boyfriend worked beside him. ''But we'll get it done. We always do.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of onlookers are expected to crowd along the Las Vegas Strip at 2 a.m. Tuesday to watch as the Loizeauxes set off a chain reaction of explosions that will force a storied but tired property to collapse upon itself. A fireworks show is planned, too, but the main attraction is clearly the destruction of the New Frontier to make way for a splashier edifice.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Loizeauxes are the first family of a decidedly distinct business that started with Mr. Loizeaux's late father, Jack Loizeaux, who as a Baltimore forestry worker realized in the late 1940s that dynamite was the easiest and fastest way to remove the roots of trees that had died from Dutch elm disease. That discovery led to a full-time job blowing up tree roots until others started asking him to knock down man-made structures, too. He went on to blast coal tipples, low bridges and eventually buildings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As business picked up, Jack Loizeaux founded Controlled Demolition Inc.; his wife was the first to use the term ''implosion'' as a softer way to describe using explosives to make a building crumble of its own weight. Jack Loizeaux's two sons later took over his business, and now several of his grandchildren are on the job, too. The staff of Controlled Demolition, a multimillion-dollar business, includes about a dozen people, half of whom are family members who also share a 45-acre estate in Baltimore County.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the reasons why this is a family business is anybody in this building is capable of taking all our lives with one mistake at any point in time,'' said Mark Loizeaux, who lost much of his hearing and was badly banged up in 1973 when an unspent piece of dynamite exploded as he worked in a debris pile after an implosion. ''There needs to be a high level of trust.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the New Frontier, these Grim Reapers of architecture are scheduled to jet off to Bal Harbour, Fla., to demolish two shuttered towers of a Sheraton. By year's end they are to take out a grain elevator in Philadelphia, a 10-foot-tall below-ground structure at the Escondida Copper Mine in Chile and the Susquehanna River Bridge near Harrisburg, Pa., which is being replaced. Other notable projects have included the Kingdome in Seattle and the remains of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City after the 1995 bombing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's always been normal because I grew up in it, but of course your friends always think it's extremely odd,'' said Devon Loizeaux, a daughter. ''I get to travel the world. I'm 26 and I've been to 11 different countries; we might be going to Korea soon.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that is fun and challenging, Mr. Loizeaux said, but the Vegas jobs draw the most attention because the structures being destroyed are not especially old and are always replaced by something more grand.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only in Vegas do structures this young come down, because time is money here and money is what Vegas is all about,'' Mr. Loizeaux said. ''The purveyors here understand what it takes; they know how to sacrifice a structure if they can replace it with something that's going to be more beneficial, a bigger draw, a little glitzier, a little more glam involved.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, the New Frontier, which opened as the Hotel Last Frontier in 1942 and was the second resort on what would become the Strip, is to be replaced by the Plaza, a $2 billion hotel-casino from the Israeli owners of the Plaza Hotel in New York City.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Frontier, whose name, theme and owner had changed several times, was notable as the first spot Elvis Presley played in Las Vegas in 1956 and as having been once owned by Howard Hughes. But more recently it was known as the site of a six-year strike in the 1990s by culinary workers, and the hotel had deteriorated to the point that the casino developer Steve Wynn last year called it ''the single biggest toilet in Las Vegas.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remarkable precision of the Loizeauxes' work -- the 32-story Stardust Hotel-Casino collapsed in less than 10 seconds in March -- keeps them atop the field, said Alan Feldman, spokesman for MGM Mirage, which hired the Loizeauxes most recently to demolish the Boardwalk Hotel-Casino on the Strip.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They do what they do with the craftsmanship of a great shoemaker or carpenter, someone who does this fine, detailed work,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''It just so happens their fine detailed work is taking down big complex buildings.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: The New Frontier Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas was stripped down to its bones in preparation for demolition, set for early Tuesday.

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SILICON VALLEY is percolating again, with venture capital flowing, Google's stock in the stratosphere and companies like Facebook valued in the billions. And in increasing numbers, the rich are cultivating a sense of noblesse oblige.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not O.K. to be stingy in Silicon Valley anymore,'' said Peter Hero, the senior adviser at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which helps its members give money away through donor-advised funds. ''It used to be O.K. to be stingy because there was this libertarian sense of, 'I'm making my workers rich, and if they want to give it away, that's O.K.' But that's not true now.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hero, 64, was the president of one of two foundations that merged last year to form this one, and the group he led raised $1.3 billion from 1996 to 2006. For two decades, he has worked at getting successful entrepreneurs to relish the idea of giving.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now his foundation works with a lot of people ''who suddenly became wealthy, realized they could do something and don't want to look stupid and give to the wrong thing,'' he said. ''They show up and say, 'I've been giving to my church and my alma mater, but I want do more than that now.'''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than just sit back and write checks, Mr. Hero said, ''what people in Silicon Valley want is a high-impact strategy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hear over and over: 'I want to do something that makes a difference. Not just a big charity that everyone knows about,''' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, high-tech entrepreneurs are turning their business acumen to mission-oriented investing, treating their giving as an investment that looks for both a financial and social return. They have invested in companies that make irrigation pumps for Africa, in microcredit ventures and in sustainable timber companies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of mission-related investing has been around Silicon Valley for several years, but it is only in the past two or three that the practice has taken hold.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a lot of people deploying a lot of capital in these for-profit opportunities that have a social outcome,'' said Jim Fruchterman, founder of Benetech, a nonprofit organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that develops software for disabled people, environmental groups and others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 200 such donors make up a group called SV2, short for Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund, which makes multiyear grants to organizations chosen and vetted by the members. Others are setting up family foundations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charly Kleissner, 50, an engineer with what he calls a ''very successful career in Silicon Valley,'' has focused on philanthropy for the past six years and with his wife, Lisa, runs his family foundation, KL Felicitas Foundation, which is endowed with $11 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I made so much money, I figured I didn't need that much,'' he said. ''And I didn't want to spend all of it on me and my family.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sustainability ''arguably being the biggest issue of the 21st century,'' Mr. Kleissner said, his foundation has sought investments in for-profit social ventures. For the past five or six years, he has been working full time at social investments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his investments is in Pico Bonito, a commercial spinoff of an ecological nonprofit group that is reforesting land around Pico Bonito National Park in Honduras. The profit venture is creating sustainable timber products for distribution and sale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With some of these investments, Mr. Kleissner said, he is willing to make a trade-off on the financial return, as long as there is a demonstrable social or environmental return. In the Pico Bonito case, he said, he is measuring the social return with metrics like jobs created in the two dozen or so villages affected by the project.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The environmental return includes the elimination of large amounts of carbon dioxide emissions,'' he said, ''and all the other environmental benefits associated with reforestation, like reintroduction of native forest species, establishing a permanent mechanism for plant, animal and ecosystem rejuvenation and preservation.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People like Mr. Kleissner, Mr. Hero said, ''aren't willing to simply trod in the well-worn philanthropic paths of the 20th century, and they're creating new and complex and highly successful strategies to make greater social impact and to bring all the players -- for-profit companies, nonprofits and individual social entrepreneurs -- together to create greater leverage for each.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the active engagement, Mr. Hero said, is that instead of giving money away at the end of their lives, people are giving it away while still young. Bill Gates, he said, is a prominent example.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gates has said that when he started Microsoft, the idea of making money and at the same time giving it away seemed like lunacy,'' Mr. Hero said. With guidance from his family, Mr. Gates began thinking about getting involved in philanthropy while he was still young. Still, Microsoft was 25 years old before Mr. Gates and his wife, Melinda, set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ''Now he says, 'Some things can't wait,' '' Mr. Hero said. ''He'd like to see everyone do it now.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veterans of the philanthropic way of life, like Mr. Hero and Mr. Fruchterman, continue to push their peers to do more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Within a 10-mile radius of Palo Alto, there are a couple of thousand families that could give $50 million to a social cause and fundamentally change some issue,'' Mr. Fruchterman said. ''You could do a lot with $50 million, or even $10 million. You could cure a disease, or revolutionize services to an impoverished part of the world.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Hero is pushing wealthy entrepreneurs to think differently about how they compute their giving. ''Giving as a percent of your income is an attitude that has to change,'' he said. Giving a percentage of net worth might be a better model, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Google, in particular, as the stock price continues to rise, the number of employees with stock options who find themselves suddenly worth millions is also rising.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YOU would think that if a quarter of a million angel investors were pouring $25.6 billion into fledgling companies, as they were last year, finding one to put money in your own venture would not be hard. Think again: wealthy investors, or angels, don't advertise themselves.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been an angel since 1980,'' said William Payne, an entrepreneur who sold his dielectric-powder making company to DuPont in 1982. ''I discovered that if I went to a conference and put 'Bill Payne, Angel,' on my badge, I'd leave the conference with 10 business plans, and I'm supposed to be retired.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is why Mr. Payne belongs to the Vegas Valley Angels, a group in Las Vegas of about 50 entrepreneurs and businesspeople who have invested a total of $8 million in 12 seed and start-up companies since 2003. There are 265 of these seraphic choirs in the United States and Canada, with a total of about 6,000 members.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike solo angels, groups want to be found so they can stimulate a flow of deals to invest in. They operate Web sites where they list the companies they have invested in as well as the kinds of deals they want. They also have an online application process. CommonAngels in Boston even posts short biographies of its members. The Angel Capital Association lists groups in all the states, at angelcapitalassociation.org.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Angels invest in 1 to 2 percent of the opportunities they review, Mr. Payne said. Groups can apportion the labor of screening applications, inviting the authors of promising ventures to make presentations, checking out the entrepreneur's claims through due diligence and negotiating investment terms. The approach is somewhat similar to the venture capitalist approach, but angels invest at the start-up stage, while venture capitalists get in later. The average deal is $240,000 versus $7 million or more for venture capitalists.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Del Brady, the founder of Redpath Integrated Pathology in Pittsburgh, said that entrepreneurs should look for early financing from a group, because vetting deals ''helps you formulate a better plan.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes you move from intuition to validation,'' she added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her biotech company raised $120,000 in 2004 from BlueTree Allied Angels in Pittsburgh, and is now big enough to attract venture-capital money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Eric David Greenspan, another entrepreneur, discovered, ''Groups do nothing but provide you with support.'' Mr. Greenspan came up with the concept for Make It Work, a company in Santa Barbara, Calif., that dispatches computer technicians in Mini Coopers to solve problems for residential customers. He raised $1.5 million in 2005 from Tech Coast Angels, a Southern California group. When he needed help negotiating an alliance with Verizon, John Harbison, who leads investments for the group and has written a book on such alliances, coached Mr. Greenspan through the negotiation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before they part with their money, groups want to see a business plan that specifies the need the company will satisfy, the market for its product or service and how the money will be used. They want to invest in businesses that can grow enough to return 10 times their investment when the company is sold. The Angel Capital Association said, however, that the average return on investment for a deal is 2.6 times the investment over a holding period of three and a half years. Only 7 percent of the deals earn back 10 times or more.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But entrepreneurs must also demonstrate passion for the business they are creating (as opposed to being caught up in the coolness of the technology behind it), and their coachability.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We view ourselves as offering mentoring and guidance, and if you don't want that, you can always get your money someplace else,'' Mr. Harbison said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Geisler, a Milwaukee engineer, quickly understood. After a long career as an executive in medical electronics, Mr. Geisler had an idea for a sensor that measures anesthesia gases and does not need calibration, which is expensive in gas sensors. Mr. Geisler presented his concept to the Golden Angels group in Milwaukee last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All I had were slides,'' he said. ''My prototype looked like a science project and was too big to bring in a room.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two angels who were listening operated an industrial gas company, and they realized that Mr. Geisler's technology could have wider uses in markets like the automotive business. For the group to invest, however, Mr. Geisler would have to focus on the industrial market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought an anesthesia sensor was really needed,'' he said, ''but as I drove home, I realized they were right. The industrial market was so much bigger, a thousand times medical.'' He worked with the two angels to do a marketing study and produce a new business plan. The group agreed to invest a mid-six-figure amount to pay for a prototype to test auto emissions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An entrepreneur's passion is demonstrated through superior execution, ''and if you execute well, that's better than a patent,'' Mr. Harbison said. That is what impressed the Tech Coast Angels about Mr. Greenspan in Santa Barbara, who realized that at one point he had not heard from 300 of his 2,000 customers in more than a year. His employees called each of those 300 to find out why and discovered that 297 were happy with the service and had not needed more help. The remaining three were unhappy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, for most entrepreneurs a 99 percent customer approval rating would be enough,'' Mr. Harbison said. ''But not for Eric.'' The Mini Coopers fanned out and the three became customers again. ''Now, that's passion.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the latest twist on the information-age truism that technology is making the world even smaller, entrepreneurs in India are trying to build a new market for the offshore services they offer: helping small businesses cope with even the most mundane day-to-day tasks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to Indian companies like Brickwork India and GetFriday, even sole proprietors can have personal assistants to conduct research, monitor the Web, make appointments and even give them a wake-up call and tell them to get some exercise -- all for as little as $15 an hour.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woman in New Jersey who works for a health care company used the new services to investigate trends in pharmaceutical marketing. An entrepreneur in Toronto used them to build his Web site. A Web designer in Louisiana has them search for images he can use. A builder in Tennessee uses them to get statistical reports on vacant lots before he buys them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man in Cambridge, Mass., even started a business, TajTunes, in which he gets the workers to telephone people in the United States with singing telegrams for $5 a call.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who hasn't dreamt of having someone to do all that stuff?'' said Kim Levy, the Morristown, N.J., woman who used Brickwork to scour the current literature and come up with a report on health care dynamics. Ms. Levy is the vice president for strategic planning at Micromass Communications, a 120-person company based in North Carolina that helps medical businesses with marketing. She has also used a New York-based service, Ask Sunday, for more personal tasks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many others using the services, Ms. Levy was inspired by two books: Thomas L. Friedman's ''The World Is Flat'' and Timothy Ferriss's ''The 4-Hour Workweek.'' Mr. Ferriss preaches that people spend 80 percent of their time on the trivial 20 percent of tasks, and he urges readers to outsource anything that can be done for a cost less than the value of their own time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferriss recommends Brickwork and GetFriday, and both services are reaping the benefit. Brickwork has a staff of 160 in Bangalore and uses as many as 150 others as consultants, according to its founder and chief executive, Vivek Kulkarni. Brickwork says that it has had 150 clients in the United States and many more in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GetFriday, a division of TTK Services, has a staff of 140 serving about 1,000 clients, according to the company's director, Sunder Prakasham. He said that a related division, YourManInIndia, serves 20,000 Indian expatriates who want to get things done in their homeland. GetFriday charges $15 an hour, plus $10 a month, though rates are lower for those who have monthly plans. For instance, a 40-hour-a-month plan costs $360. Brickwork charges $15 to $25 an hour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a three-week wait for new clients of GetFriday, and the company is hiring 25 people a week to meet the demand, Mr. Sunder said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the waiting time is but one of a number of imperfections in the still-developing market for outsourced labor. People in the United States who have used the services of companies like Brickwork and GetFriday say they have wrestled with miscommunication, poorly received instructions and work that has not met expectations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This stuff is very much in its infancy, both in terms of trust from the buyer side and in ink on deals,'' said Frances Karamouzis, a vice president at the Gartner Group, where she is an analyst who specializes in outsourcing. The people in India ''don't always have the greatest client service skills or business acumen or accents,'' she said. But those hurdles can be overcome. Failures result when the person doing the outsourcing has not set the right expectations or is not properly understood.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Wood, an entrepreneur who was dissatisfied with some of GetFriday's services, hoped his assistant would be able to book him a cheap trip to India, perhaps using local knowledge. Instead, the assistant sent him a list of fares from Travelocity, which Mr. Wood said he could have done himself. While Mr. Wood admits that he did not set clear expectations, he has moved on to a new idea: outsourcing his tasks to college students in the United States.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wood -- who has taken his own business, writing software and working for technology companies, to Mexico -- pays $14 an hour to a graduate student in Utah who was making $8 an hour in a campus job. Mr. Wood has a Web site, havingthingsdone.com, ready for his outsourcing venture, which he has not yet started. ''There's an untapped network of readily available, digitally savvy, on-the-way-to-being-well-educated labor force,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Silicon Valley company, Rearden Commerce, has a technological solution that it calls a ''virtual personal assistant.'' Rearden's software pulls data from a variety of sources, including travel, restaurant and shipping sites, and makes it available in one application that syncs with a calendar and can manage a busy business owner's life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Ford, vice president for product marketing at Rearden, in Foster City, Calif., said that rather than send an e-mail to India asking an assistant to book a flight, hotel and restaurant, it would be easier to book through one site that already knows your calendar and your personal preferences.   </p>

But that may be only the start of the story.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Magazines as diverse as The Harvard Business Review and Entrepreneur are running articles this month saying that the focus on immediate results is also responsible for stifling creativity and impeding the development of future executives.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The allure of achieving a huge financial payoff fairly quickly can cause managers to focus on the wrong thing, Mark Henricks writes in Entrepreneur.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Company founders may end up focusing on the needs of the venture capitalists or spend more time than they should tailoring their company to be attractive to a potential acquirer, instead of focusing on the needs of their customers, he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, ''businesses that are founded and managed with the objective of getting funded during a hot market may also suffer from creativity hamstrung by the need for speed,'' Mr. Henricks writes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founders may rush so quickly to market -- in trying to become attractive enough to Wall Street to hold an initial public offering or to lure a potential acquirer -- that their best ideas may not be given time to develop.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph L. Bower, a professor of management at Harvard Business School, contends that this short-term focus also hurts the development of the next generation of managers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Too many companies have over the past two decades ignored the hard work of building future leaders, while senior executives have focused increasingly on meeting the next quarter's earnings targets,'' he writes in The Harvard Business Review.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Bower argues that it takes years to develop the next generation of leaders, and companies need to give them the time and opportunity to try new ideas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies, he contends, must find a way to balance ''the need to meet short-term expectations with the need to invest over the long term in the development of the organization's people.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON SECOND THOUGHT The banking secrecy laws are far more likely to ensnare innocent people than catch terrorists as they were supposed to do, according to Ibrahim A. Warde, who teaches international business at Tufts University.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in Worth magazine, Mr. Warde says the stringent bank reporting laws passed after the Sept. 11 attacks may have been well intended, but they do not work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In reality, terrorism is neither costly nor driven by financial profit,'' he writes. ''The Sept. 11 terrorists needed only $300,000 to cause massive destruction; the London subway attacks of July 2005 cost less than $1,000.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warde says that by law banks in the United States must notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, part of the Treasury Department, of any cash transaction exceeding $10,000 or any transaction that seems inconsistent with the way a client normally does business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do so by filing what is known as a suspicious activity report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is estimated that more than one million SARs are now filed every year in the United States at an annual cost of $8 billion to banks,'' Mr. Warde wrote.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, after ceasing publication for five years, it was purchased by a group whose publisher, Joseph Guerriero, told the magazine Publishing Executive, ''We feel very, very bullish about the long-term success of Success.''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after printing only five issues, Mr. Guerriero's bosses cried uncle, and sold the magazine to VideoPlus, a direct-marketing company based in Dallas that is equally confident it will succeed where others, for more than 100 years, have failed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darren Hardy, the business magazine's new publisher, said it would have personal-development focus, echoing its founder, Orison Swett Marden, a progenitor of the self-help movement. (Mr. Marden died in 1924; the magazine closed during the Depression and was resurrected by new owners in 1954.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to a Forbes profile on Richard Branson of the Virgin Group that would examine his newest acquisitions, a Success article would ''take a look at how Richard Branson sets goals and motivates employees, what's his morning ritual and what he does to keep himself healthy, fit and vital,'' Mr. Hardy said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VideoPlus produces training materials for the direct-sales industry and publishes several magazines, including Success From Home and Empowering Women. All consist of sponsored content, the print equivalent of infomercials, but editorial content of Success, which has yet to name an editor, will be independent, Mr. Hardy said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Success will be published bimonthly and the company will fulfill the 15,000 subscriptions from its previous incarnation, projecting 100,000 subscribers when it hits newsstands in March. It will be marketed to readers ages 30 to 55 who earn $75,000 to $100,000 a year, and will seek advertisers that cater to small business, like FedEx and Dell Computer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About the prospect of Success's latest owners faring better than others, Samir Husni, the head of the University of Mississippi's journalism department, said, ''The Chinese have a saying that doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result every time is the definition of insanity.''

Another report, this one from the government, estimated that Germany's annual inflation rose to 3 percent this month, its highest level in more than 13 years, as a result of high prices for oil products, food and beverages. The Ifo Institute for Economic Research said its business climate index rose slightly, to 104.2, from 103.9 in October, after slipping for six straight months. Companies assessed their current situation more positively than in October, but were ''somewhat more cautious'' regarding the six-month business outlook, said Hans-Werner Sinn, above, Ifo's president. The 3 percent annual inflation estimate by the Federal Statistics Office was up from 2.4 percent in October.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chiefs are getting worried.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surveys of corporate chief executives and chief financial officers released yesterday showed sharp declines in optimism about the economy and business conditions, providing more evidence that the economy is slowing.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 9 percent of chief financial officers said they were more optimistic about the economy in December than they had been three months earlier, a record low. ''We've never seen anything like that,'' said John R. Graham, a finance professor at Duke University, which conducted the survey with CFO Magazine. ''C.F.O. optimism is spiraling downward.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly survey of chief executives found that 41 percent expected employment in the economy would decrease over the next three months, by far the largest such figure since the survey began in late 2002. Only 16 percent forecast an improvement in employment, with the rest expecting no change. As recently as July, only 12 percent forecast the employment situation would worsen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''C.E.O.'s have been clear over the past several months that they are worried about the economic climate,'' said Edward M. Kopko, the publisher of Chief Executive magazine, which conducted the survey of 533 chief executives who subscribe to the magazine. ''The recent dramatic drop in confidence may suggest that the worst is yet to come.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the C.E.O. confidence index fell for the fourth consecutive month, and was the lowest since May 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp trend toward pessimism appears to have affected smaller companies more than larger ones, and to have the strongest impact at companies with the least-solid balance sheets. Mr. Graham said that a third of the 573 American C.F.O.'s said their companies had been hurt by the credit crisis, but that half of those with credit ratings of BBB, the lowest investment grade rating, or lower, said their companies had been hurt.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surveys were released a day after a more upbeat survey of 105 chief executives who are members of the Business Roundtable, a group of large American companies. That survey showed a small increase in confidence from the previous quarter, with 33 percent saying they expected their companies to increase hiring in this country in the next six months, while 22 percent expected to cut employment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pessimism seems to be less pronounced for executives' own companies. Among the financial officers, 34.3 percent said they were more optimistic about their own companies than they had been three months earlier. But that was the lowest positive response to that question since it was first asked in 2002, and 36.6 percent said they had become more pessimistic.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among chief executives, slightly more said their companies were reducing capital spending than said they planned increases. But the C.F.O. survey showed an average increase of 4.1 percent planned for capital spending, higher than the 3.2 percent planned three months earlier.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial officer survey asked, for the first time, if companies had experienced ''an increase in the number of employees taking loans or making hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) accounts?'' A total of 18.5 percent said they had, with the most-cited reason being the need to make mortgage payments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit crisis, which began in the subprime mortgage market, has spread to the leveraged loan market, which is a source of financing for many companies that lack investment-grade credit ratings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Fed has considerable interest in measuring the potential impact of the credit crisis on the overall economy,'' said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke professor who founded the C.F.O. survey, ''and our survey provides the first direct evidence of the credit fallout.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that of the firms that said they had been affected by the credit problems, ''one-third will cut capital spending plans as a result of the conditions, and one-quarter indicate that hiring plans will be scaled back. These actions are detrimental to economic growth.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori Sandler traces the start of her company to the day in 1999 that her son Benjamin celebrated his first birthday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long before, she had learned that Benjamin was allergic to peanuts, tree nuts like cashews and walnuts, milk, eggs, sesame and shellfish. All Ms. Sandler could come up with to celebrate was some shaved ice with a candle in it.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, he was too young to know the difference. But Ms. Sandler took to her kitchen to create treats that were safe for her son to eat. Then, she started working on recipes that she could make commercially, knowing that thousands of families also have children with food allergies. In late 2004, she started Divvies, a company that sells cookies, popcorn, cupcakes, candy and gift-pack combinations that are free of peanuts, tree nuts, milk and eggs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really wanted to turn the tables when it came to people with food allergies,'' Ms. Sandler said. ''I wanted them to have the goods everyone wanted instead of them desiring things other people had.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sandler is among a handful of entrepreneurs who are starting businesses that sell candy, cookies, cakes and other sweets free of potential allergens. The companies were almost all started by people who are allergic or are relatives of children with life-threatening allergies to nuts, eggs and dairy products.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's been a pretty huge increase in these companies, and a lot of them seem to be people who were personally affected by an allergy or intolerance and didn't think there was enough out there for themselves or their children,'' said Robert Pacenza, executive director of the Food Allergy Initiative, a nonprofit organization that raises money to treat and cure food allergies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 12 million Americans have food allergies, according to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. Fish allergies are the most prevalent, with 6.9 million people reporting them, followed by peanut allergies, 3.3 million people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ms. Sandler, those who started the companies said they did not want their children to have to feel left out at birthday parties and celebrations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gail Elvidge learned that her son, Tanner, had a life-threatening nut allergy in 1998, when he was 8 months old. She worried that Tanner would miss out on her family's tradition of giving one another chocolates and fudge because many chocolates contain traces of nuts or are manufactured on machines that nuts have passed through.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't want my son to go through life without experiencing the same traditions,'' she said. ''It was frustrating that he and other children with the allergy couldn't enjoy the same treats that I did. I decided I wanted to take a chance, make a change and start a business.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Elvidge quit her accounting job and started making chocolates in her kitchen and mailing them to customers. The mail-order venture took off, and Ms. Elvidge said her business, Vermont Nut Free Chocolates, ships about 17,000 orders of candy, chocolate-covered pretzels and baking products each year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Elvidge said the business took off on its own, making enough money so she could expand to a small factory in Grand Isle, Vt. All employees must sign a form stating they will not eat nuts or things with traces of nuts at work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allergy sufferers and parents of children with allergies say the strict policies against cross-contamination like signed waivers and frequent testing of products are what make these companies so appealing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't have a child with food allergies, you don't know that every time they put a bite in their mouth or every time they cough you look over and say, 'Are you O.K.?' It's kind of like a time bomb,'' said Kara Sullivan of Wellesley, Mass. Her 5-year-old son, William, is allergic to milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, garlic, beef, sesame and shellfish.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William's first birthday cake was an avocado, because he couldn't eat anything else, Ms. Sullivan said. She discovered batters that were free of milk and eggs for William's third birthday, and made him a cake.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I let him eat the whole thing,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ''I have tears in my eyes right now thinking about him eating his first cake.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same experience spurred Ms. Sandler. She spent months perfecting her cookie recipes and then hired a consultant, designer and marketing expert to help start the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our philosophy is that eating and celebrating should be a shared experience, an inclusive experience,'' Ms. Sandler said. ''Eating is always the center of every gathering, and you want to be inclusive with the food.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, Mark, put their savings into the company and bought a building in South Salem, N.Y., which they turned into a bakery. The company would not say how many units it produces each week, but it did say it supplies treats to Disney World and does a brisk Internet business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sandler and others who have started these small businesses say it is not easy. They first have to find companies that will guarantee that their flour, sugar and other ingredients will be free of nuts, dairy or eggs, and then must adhere to the Food and Drug Administration's regulations on food safety.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was totally new to me,'' said Beth Cherico of Westlake, Ohio, who started Amanda's Own Confections in 2002. ''I had to learn the business of food, safety, how to do food prep correctly. It took me a year to make sure we did everything right.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cherico, who still works as an occupational therapist, had a strategy of slow growth, investing about $14,000 in mixing equipment and allowing sales to rise gradually so that she and her husband, Steve, would not have to take out a loan. The company now has its own small plant in Westlake and does mainly Internet orders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patsy Rosenberg and her husband, Chip, had to learn how to grapple not only with regulations but also with allergies themselves. Ms. Rosenberg's multiple food allergies were diagnosed when she was 31, and she had to learn to eat again. She could no longer let herself taste or make the treats she was famous for whipping up, so she took to her kitchen and formulated a handful of cake and muffin recipes that were safe for her.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004 the Rosenbergs, who live in Weston, Mass., decided to start a business, Cherrybrook Kitchen, investing $10,000. Soon after, they attended a trade show and reached deals with four supermarkets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenberg, a former real estate agent, and Ms. Rosenberg, who stayed at home with the couple's two daughters, said the learning curve was steep. They now run Cherrybrook Kitchen full time.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had to learn the food business,'' Mr. Rosenberg said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple threw themselves into it, attending seminars and trade shows and researching regulations. It has worked. The company does not disclose financial information, but it said that after three years it is well on its way to reaching its five-year goal of a total of $6 million in sales. Still, Ms. Rosenberg said the business was about much more than profit.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's life-altering for me to have these products, and when I hear from people who can finally have treats because of our products it makes me feel like I've given them the best gift in the world,'' she said. ''I've made them happy and hopefully released some of the stress that comes with living with food allergies.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $100 million company whose sales climb by $50 million has increased revenue by 50 percent. A $10 billion company, with the same $50 million gain, has bumped up sales only one half of one percent.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reward is that they get big,'' he writes in Portfolio magazine. ''The punishment is that when they get big, it gets harder and harder for them to grow. And then their investors pile on the abuse.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grove, now a lecturer at Stanford's business school and a senior adviser at Intel, suggests an antidote: large, successful firms can engage in what he calls ''cross-boundary disruption.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Under certain conditions a firm can create a new growth spurt for itself by entering an entirely different industry,'' he writes. ''The target industry must be stagnant and populated with companies that cling to doing business the way they always have.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANAGEMENT MODELS Is there a formal model that companies can follow to grow internally? Robert C. Wolcott and Michael J. Lippitz, both associated with Northwestern University's business school, list in an article in the M.I.T.Sloan Management Review the following four models:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opportunist. The company provides no formal process to follow. Various departments and individuals work on their own ideas and then seek corporate financing. This is what happens at Zimmer Holdings, a medical device company with more than $3 billion in sales.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enabler. The company provides clear criteria for the sorts of things it would like developed, application guidelines for financing and support from senior management, then leaves it to employees to come up with new ideas. This, the authors say, is the model Google employs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer. ''A few companies such as I.B.M., Motorola and Cargill pursue corporate entrepreneurship by establishing and supporting formal organizations with significant dedicated funds or active influence over business unit funding.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocate. A company ''strongly evangelizes'' for corporate entrepreneurship but, as is the case at DuPont, leaves it up to the individual business units to provide financing and manage the process.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHANGED FOR GOOD Radical transformation efforts inside big companies fail for any number of reasons, among them insufficient resources devoted to the task, a loss of interest by the chief executive or naysayers who are allowed to stay in place.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two McKinsey consultants argue that focusing on two areas can improve the chances that a company will change for the better.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief executive should set ''an appropriate and inspiring aspiration'' and then help mobilize ''the flow of energy and ideas needed to drive the organization forward,'' argue Josep Isern and Caroline Pung, writing in The McKinsey Quarterly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders must define the objective at the outset, delineating clear initiatives and painting a vivid picture of what success will look like, they contend.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A good transformation story bridges the gap between top management and the rest of the organization,'' they write. ''Typically, using metaphor and analogies to explain what is at stake, it addresses three key aspects: the case for change, the challenges and opportunities ahead and the impact of change on the individuals.''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever I write about successful career changers or those who fled corporate life to start businesses, readers write to me asking about the financial circumstances of the people I've profiled.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, one reader has become a regular presence in my in-box with some variant of the question, ''Is a career change possible for those of us without a trust fund, a supportive partner, rich family?''   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spurred on by this question, and by other people who have been asking for tips on the money side of entrepreneurship and careers, I have been making an effort to get people to talk about their finances as much as possible.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I decided to contact Jean Chatzky, the financial writer and adviser who always leaves me feeling that money stuff is a lot simpler than I thought. Below are excerpts from our conversation:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Whenever I write about career change, people ask me about the financial side. Is it possible to make a career change only when you have no dependents, family money, a supportive partner or a trust fund, as some of my readers suggest? Or should anyone be able to change careers with proper planning?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Of the list of things you gave, if you don't have a supportive partner, it's very hard. A partner against a change can stand in your way. But with good financial planning, anyone should be able to do this. The fear of not having enough money is what keeps people from shifting   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.It sounds like living more leanly is part of the prep. Is that the key?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. If you can live more leanly in advance, you make your life a hundred times easier. It's the same advice I give to someone who is having a baby and wants to stay home after the birth. If you spend your pregnancy living like you're not going to have that salary, you'll learn not only that you can do it, but you'll also have banked that other salary for nine months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Any other tips for anyone going through a career transition or a bout of unemployment?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Having a stash of cash in the bank is having freedom. It's why I'm such a big proponent of active habitual saving. When you're not dependent on your paycheck, you have the ability to make the choices you really want to make because you have some financial freedom. Saving through your life provides that for you. It's not just for retirement and college. It's also for being able to do the kind of work that satisfies you.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing to think about is health insurance. Far too many people -- especially young people and entrepreneurs -- are making the choice to go without coverage. Why spend $150 a month on a cellphone bill when you're not willing to save the same amount on an indemnity policy (a high-deductible health insurance policy) that can save you from financial ruin? People say, ''I'm healthy now. I don't need to spend money on this.'' The problem is that then something happens and you haven't paid to have hospitalization coverage. If you're young and healthy, you may not want the same level of coverage, but you have to provide for emergencies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You write a lot about overcoming debt in our personal lives, but what about when debt follows us into our careers? What are the options for entrepreneurs who have a less than stellar credit history?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Unfortunately, we're in a time when credit is harder to establish and harder to get when you don't have a decent credit score. A lot of entrepreneurs get financing from friends and family, but it can leave them wondering if they will ever get paid back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also some new options, like a company called CircleLending (now Virgin Money), which provides a structure you can use if friends and family want to lend you money. There is also Prosper, a site that lets you borrow money not from friends and family but from others.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Are there any best practices for borrowing money from friends? Do you recommend a written agreement, and if so, at minimum, what should that cover? Does it pay to get lawyers involved?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I do recommend a written agreement. The tendency is to approach it as if there are no restrictions. But the person lending money can be a little more strapped than the borrower realizes. And an agreement can provide peace of mind for the giver. Having a piece of paper makes people on both sides of the transition feel like it should be eventually paid back. If the loan is forgiven, there is a good way to deal with that through Virgin Money. You could get lawyers involved, but you don't have to. It really depends on the amount of money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Many businesses can be started with very little capital these days, and I've talked to lots entrepreneurs who say they are not interested in outside investors or taking on debt. How do you know when it is wise to take that approach and when the only way to really grow a business is to take on debt or an infusion of capital?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Some people know these things innately. If you don't, get some outside advice. And if you can't afford that help, I love the folks at Score [an organization of volunteer professionals who offer free advice to fledgling entrepreneurs]. They provide a lot of great advice and counseling for no money at all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Do you find that people's personal finance habits usually mirror their money habits in their career or business?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I find that people, especially entrepreneurs who feel strongly about their businesses, often sabotage their personal finance for the sake of a business or career. It's a mistake. The tendency is to throw it all back into the business. The reality is that even if you are working for yourself, especially if you are, no one will be there to take care of your retirement, so you need to make sure that you have a retirement plan as part of your business plan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.You focus a lot on women and money. How do you think gender issues show up around our relationships to money?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Gender issues come about in two ways. Women have a greater need for money at the end of their lives, yet amass less money over the course of their lives because we take breaks for babies, we're traditional caregivers for our aging parents and we live an average of seven years longer than men. The other place it shows up -- and it's changing, but not changing fast enough for me -- is that we have been unwilling to ask for as much in the work force as we deserve. As a result, if your starting salary start outs smaller, and the raises pile on incrementally, you amass less over time because you're building on a smaller base.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.With the holiday season approaching, can you share any advice on holiday gifts for colleagues, clients and other professional contacts?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Set the budget and then figure out what you can afford in light of what you're making this year. Cast the net and divvy it up. I like equality. Come up with a gift and give it to anyone who is making a difference in your professional life. It's also a lot easier to order 20 of something. If your pie gets so small, or once you divide it, it doesn't seem to be enough, make a contribution to a charity on behalf of your clients, send out cards and call it a day.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small-business lobbying group that had a big role in derailing Hillary Rodham Clinton's effort to overhaul health care in the early 1990s has staked out its position for the 2008 political season.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, the National Federation of Independent Business, which says it has 350,000 members and lobbyists in 50 states, warned politicians and policy makers on Wednesday not to impose new health-benefit obligations on small employers.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said in a statement of principles that ''a health care system built on employer mandates or on play-or-pay taxes is unacceptable.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democratic presidential candidates, including Senator Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards, have generally called for requiring employers to provide coverage or to pay into a fund to help insure many of the 47 million people in the United States without coverage. Republican candidates have talked less about health care, usually supporting the Bush administration's proposals for tax incentives to help pay for coverage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are opposed to payroll taxes,'' said Susan Eckerly, a vice president for the business federation. ''They are the No. 1 job killer for the small-business owner.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization has been working on health care issues with a broad group of lobbying allies, including the Business Roundtable, a group of corporate chiefs; the Service Employees International Union; the National Restaurant Association; AARP, the advocacy group for older people; and the building contractors lobby.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement of principles, the federation called for universal health care, with a government safety net to help the neediest obtain coverage. But it opposed proposals to place health care under an umbrella of Medicare-style ''single payer'' financing. Government safety nets should not be allowed to ''crowd out private insurance and care,'' the federation said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate national survey released Wednesday by the Mercer benefits consulting firm found that both small and large employers were skeptical about ''play or pay'' proposals that would require them to offer a health plan or pay into a fund to provide coverage for the uninsured.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 23 percent of small employers and 25 percent of large companies with 500 or more workers support play or pay, according to a telephone survey by Mercer. In Massachusetts, which introduced such a policy in October 2006, employer support was slightly higher, 30 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although small businesses say they are hard pressed by health costs, which are rising by double digit percentages each year for small companies, the federation said very few of its members that provide employee benefits had ended coverage. Only about half of the group's members provide employee health coverage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Eckerly said the small-business group had joined with restaurant owners and contractors in inviting all the presidential candidates to discuss health care on conference calls with hundreds of their members.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, she said, four Republican candidates, Mitt Romney, Fred D. Thompson, Rudolph W. Giuliani and John McCain, have taken part in these calls. Senator Clinton's health policy advisers have briefed officials of the small- business federation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Stottlemyer, the group's president and chief executive, said that Mrs. Clinton's plan ''recognizes the challenges facing small businesses'' by excluding firms with fewer than 25 workers from her proposed requirement that employers provide health insurance or contribute to the cost of coverage.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have not endorsed any candidate,'' Mr. Stottlemyer added.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly ''tankan'' survey showed the sentiment index for large manufacturers at 19, down from 23 in the previous survey in September, and below the 21 mark forecast by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRESH off 80-hour workweeks in a sprint for holiday sales, it is little wonder that some entrepreneurs are escaping for a precious few days of sun and relaxation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're constantly pushing, pushing, pushing,'' said Jeffrey Golden of BearHands &amp; Buddies, which sells animal-inspired clothing and accessories, ''you're going to end up losing sight of what you need to do.'' Mr. Golden and his family are headed to Aruba on Friday.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ridgely Evers and his wife, Colleen McGlynn, of DaVero, a maker of olive oil and other specialty food items, left for Mexico on the day after Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are the lucky ones,'' points out Joel R. Evans, a marketing professor at the Zarb School of Business at Hofstra University. ''The typical small retailer can't afford to do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for many small-business owners, the weeks after Christmas and New Year are time to recharge after the adrenaline rush of the holiday season gives way to an emotional letdown. Some entrepreneurs decompress at home; others, if they can, squeeze in a vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letdown could be more intense than usual if, as retail consultants expect, sales slowed markedly in the 2007 holiday season. Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director at the Strategic Resource Group in New York, for one, expects sales were 1.7 percent to 2.3 percent higher than 2006 for all retailers. Other estimates range from 3 to 4 percent higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller retailers like BearHands in Little Ferry, N.J., and DaVero in Sonoma County, Calif., can derive a third or more of their profit -- and most of their sales -- in November and December, Mr. Flickinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If his estimates on retail sales prove to be correct, it was somewhat of ''a Dickensesque December for smaller retailers,'' he said, because consumers in the suburbs and small towns spent less this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, at the BearHands booth in Bryant Park in New York in December, Mr. Golden and his staff had a steady stream of customers, including many tourists. BearHands ran a booth at Columbus Circle and one at the Southern Christmas Show in Charlotte, N.C., for 10 days in November. It also has a growing wholesale business, he said, which accounts for 65 percent of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the West Coast, Mr. Evers of DaVero said, ''This holiday season has been an absolute blowout success for us.'' The opening of a DaVero retail store about two years ago at Plaza Farms in Healdsburg is a big part of that success, he said. DaVero shares space with other artisans there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other boutique shops with more remote locations that may not have fared so well can take heart, Mr. Flickinger says. While he expects sales at small retailers to slow in the first quarter, as consumers with gift cards return to national chains, they can expect a surge in sales after Passover and Easter. Why? Because shoppers will be looking for higher-quality items, a better range of products and branded names, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardware stores, variety stores and gift shops could benefit, he added, as stores like Dollar General move into food and beverages, and bigger retailers have fewer unique gifts and more private-label goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumers have a conscience, and they want to support the companies that make a commitment to their communities,'' Mr. Flickinger said. ''They are supporting the stores and merchants that Norman Rockwell painted for The Saturday Evening Post: retailers that sponsor Little League teams and give to local charities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, smaller retailers have to be nimble and strategic this month to instill customer loyalty for the rest of the year, Professor Evans of Hofstra says. He offers a list of 15 ways to be smart about marketing in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evers of DaVero says his secret is keeping an open line to his customers. ''If you're not communicating actively with your clientele,'' he says, ''somebody else is.'' DaVero routinely sends e-mail messages, making sure there is a monthly promotion to keep customers coming back to the site and the store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his other business, NetBooks, a software company, Mr. Evers, the man behind the original QuickBooks, maintains a blog for small-business owners who are his customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Golden and his staff plan to engage in grass-roots communications as they reach out to parent-teacher organizations to bolster the spiritwear business of BearHands. Middle schools, high schools, colleges and even professional teams have ordered items to show team spirit, Mr. Golden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, he will start traveling across the country to trade and licensing shows, which begin in earnest this month. ''It starts all over again,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its fourth year, BearHands has expanded from its signature products, the warm animal-themed mittens, to the accompanying buddies -- the most popular being cats, dogs, frogs, giraffes, horses, penguins and polar bears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it has added a recycled- denim line of accessories like purses, plus warm-weather gear like sun hats, baseball caps and onesies that incorporate the buddies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its wholesale business has grown accordingly from small boutiques looking for seasonal items to include gift shops at zoos, among them the Bronx Zoo, and stores like Olly Shoes and the Paper Place. Now that it has all-season gear, the company hopes to reach agreements with bigger retailers like Macy's and Dick's Sporting Goods to sell its products, Mr. Golden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This slow but steady expansion has helped BearHands avoid the inevitable January letdown, he said. So instead of being a novelty, he says, ''BearHands has more of a complete line, which helps with brand recognition. I think we're moving at the right speed.''</p>

It is difficult to be certain from here. In the relevant country, many workers doing the tasks I'll require receive low wages and face serious health problems including chronic colds , fever , stomach disorders, chest pains and tuberculosis. Is it wrong to start my business in this way? -- NAME WITHHELD, NEW YORK   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is your moral obligation to see that those who work for you even indirectly -- those from whose labor you profit -- receive decent treatment. While wages and working conditions vary internationally, nobody's idea of ''decent'' encompasses ''chronic colds, fever, stomach disorders, chest pains and tuberculosis,'' even in developing nations, even where people badly need jobs.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I concede that it can be difficult to monitor things from thousands of miles away. Fortunately, you have other options. There are labor organizations, both governmental and private, that address this vexing problem and can assist you in hiring workers who will be treated fairly. Or you might reconsider conducting at least your initial operations domestically. Local governments, trade unions and manufacturers are eager to add industrial jobs. You can consult all of them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you may not do is simply throw up your hands at working conditions overseas or fob off this duty on those with whom you contract. You must strive to learn whose sweat provides your equity and how it is extracted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UPDATE: The entrepreneur hired an outfit in Uttar Pradesh whose labor conditions are unknown to him. If the project advances, he vows to travel to India to inspect the manufacturing facilities.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am a graduate student and hire undergraduate field assistants for our research on waterfowl. We only accept people over 5-foot-5, since the work involves walking in waders in deep water. If a person is too short, water can get in over the waders -- uncomfortable and dangerous. We could accommodate shorter students by letting them work in wet suits, but it would slow down their data collection. Is height a legitimate job criterion? -- D.S., CALIFORNIA   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've hit on the essential point. You may consider an applicant's height only if it is a necessity of the job. If you were getting a master's in piano moving, you could pass over the frail and hire only those undergrads robust enough to heft a Steinway. Is a certain body type important here? Apparently so.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before rejecting shorter applicants, reasonable accommodations -- ways to arrange the work that would enable them to do the job -- must be made for size. Is wader technology so primitive that higher, bib-style, boots won't do? Is a wet suit really unusable? ''Reasonable'' is an ambiguous but not a meaningless word. You must make a good-faith effort not to capriciously reject potentially qualified candidates. Ethics demands ingenuity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UPDATE: D.S. hired someone near the cusp, just over 5-foot-5. She could reach many of the nesting sites, and there was enough work to be done to assign the taller assistants to sites in deeper water.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN -- Ireland is now alive with enthusiasm for entrepreneurs, who seemingly rank just below rock stars in popularity.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For evidence, consider the Ernst &amp; Young accounting firm's award for Irish Entrepreneur of the Year. The award show was prime-time television fare in October. (The winner, Liam Casey, runs a business, now based in China, that arranges for products to be manufactured and shipped from China to customers in Europe and the United States.)    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the government-sponsored studies proclaiming that Ireland ranks third in the European Union in early-stage entrepreneurial activity. And Enterprise Ireland, an agency of the Irish government that gives fledgling small companies a helping hand, has even leased space in an office building in Midtown Manhattan to serve as an incubator for businesses hoping to expand into the American market.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively new emphasis on entrepreneurs in Ireland is the culmination of nearly four decades of government policies that have lifted the economy from centuries of poverty to modern prosperity.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change began when Ireland entered the European Union in 1973. In subsequent years, the government rewrote its tax policies to attract foreign investment by American corporations, made all education free through the university level and changed tax rates and used direct equity investment to encourage Irish people to set up their own businesses.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The change came in the 1990s,'' said James Murphy, founder and managing director of Lifes2Good, a marketer of drugstore products for muscle aches, hair loss and other maladies. ''Taxes and interest rates came down, and all of a sudden we believed in ourselves.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new environment also encouraged Ray Nolan, who founded Raven Computing in 1989 to provide software for lawyers to keep track of billable hours. He sold that company and founded another that created software for companies to manage billing and receipts. And in 1999, he founded   <span class="companylink">Web Reservations International</span> to provide booking and property management for hostels that cater to backpackers and economy travelers.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hostel owners needed to keep track of people sharing rooms, and bookings for Americans coming to Dublin for three nights,'' said Feargal Mooney, chief operating officer of Web Reservations. ''Hostel accommodations go for 10 to 20 euro a night,'' he said, or $15 to $30 at today's exchange rates, ''so booking reservations in them wasn't profitable for the big travel companies.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the business grew -- its 100 employees and banks of computers now handle reservations for some 50,000 hostels in 166 countries -- Web Reservations was offered an equity investment by Enterprise Ireland. ''But we said this is our baby, we didn't want to give up equity,'' Mr. Mooney said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company, which is expanding in the United States and in China, has taken advantage of the agency's help to open operations in Shanghai and New York. ''They've helped us with introductions to government officials in China, and we're in the office space on Park Avenue, expanding our systems in the States,'' Mr. Mooney said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government help for Irish entrepreneurs grew out of an overall economic policy devised in 1987 that reduced personal taxes, said Kevin Sherry, a director of Enterprise Ireland who specializes in start-up companies.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Income tax rates in Ireland today are 20 percent on the first $50,000 of income and 41 percent on income above that. But there are value-added taxes of 21 percent levied on all goods and transactions, with the exception of health and medical services, children's clothing and food.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax on corporate profits, though, is 12.5 percent, which is an incentive to own a business. And government helps out. ''We have helped over 300 people or groups in the last dozen years or so,'' Mr. Sherry said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise Ireland has also put up initial capital for venture investment funds and supports research and development. ''We must support new approaches, nanotechnology, biotechnology and other sciences,'' Mr. Sherry said, ''because we cannot succeed in the future using what got us here in the past.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colm O'Gorman, who teaches entrepreneurship in master of business administration courses at Dublin City University, said the government agency is at the heart of several trends. Enterprise Ireland ''supports research and development at Irish companies and universities,'' Professor O'Gorman said, ''and it is encouraging more women to become entrepreneurs, as the role of women has changed in Irish life.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for many changes in Ireland is its membership in the European Union, which has brought new perspectives and regulations from its governing councils in Brussels.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elaine Doorly, for example, founded Radiation Safety Ireland three years ago to advise industry on effects of radiation in building materials, scanners and other sources, an evolving field that is driven by regulation from Brussels.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Doorly runs her consulting company part time while also working as the health officer specializing in radiological protection for the University of Dublin-Trinity College, the institution that is a leading site of Irish scientific research. She has held that post for 10 years.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I run training courses and consult with companies that are coping with the huge variety of radiation in ordinary objects, including the many screening systems that have been put in place since 9/11,'' said Ms. Doorly, who has a doctorate in physics from Trinity. ''It's a growth field but a niche industry.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murphy, 46, of Lifes2Good is one of the entrepreneurs who has expanded his business beyond Ireland's borders. He qualified as a chartered accountant in the 1980s and worked in several countries in Europe before returning to Ireland in 1991 looking to own a business.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He served as financial officer for the inventor of a device that used electrical current to ease muscle pain and learned how to market such treatments by making infomercials for television stations in Europe.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murphy founded Lifes2Good in 1997. Using infomercials to promote micro-current pain relief and health and beauty aids, the business spread throughout Britain and the Continent and grew to 40 employees and $30 million in annual revenue. Now he is trying to expand in the United States.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you come to the U.S., you have to be prepared to lose a couple of hundred grand for six months without panicking,'' Mr. Murphy said. His American operation also works out of Enterprise Ireland on Park Avenue.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sherry of Enterprise Ireland said the passion behind the efforts to support entrepreneurs comes from a desire to make Ireland a better place. ''We're old enough to remember when times weren't good. We don't want to go back there.''    </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young firm, McKee Nelson, helped investment banks and mortgage lenders bundle home loans into securities -- lots of them. Since 2000, McKee has been involved in almost 3,300 deals totaling $2.7 trillion, according to Asset Backed Alert, an industry newsletter.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street banks and lenders hired McKee Nelson, which is based in Washington and New York, to write or review prospectuses for the securities. It was a lucrative arrangement, helping to generate $202.5 million for the firm in 2006, the latest year for which figures are available.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with losses on bad mortgage investments exceeding $135 billion, questions are growing about whether prospectuses like these adequately disclosed the risks to investors.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark H. Adelson, a co-founder of Adelson &amp; Jacob Consulting, a securitization and real estate consulting firm, said offering documents in general lacked clear warnings about the deteriorating quality of home loans. ''That's what was missing,'' Mr. Adelson said. Most of these documents, however, did detail the mechanics of the investments and the kinds of loans backing the securities, he said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reed D. Auerbach, a structured finance partner at McKee Nelson, stands by the firm's work.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We get paid to write good disclosure,'' Mr. Auerbach said. ''We think that the offering documents we've written disclosed all the risks to investors.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state prosecutors are investigating whether Wall Street banks withheld crucial information from investors about the risks posed by subprime loans. McKee Nelson has not been subpoenaed in the investigation or accused of any wrongdoing.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as investors' losses mount, companies across the financial services industry are coming under scrutiny. Bankers, auditors and lawyers are bracing for a wave of lawsuits. One law firm,   <span class="companylink">Cadwalader Wickersham &amp; Taft</span>, is already fighting a $70 million malpractice suit over its mortgage securities work.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody who touched the security in the process of creating or selling it is going to be subject to litigation,'' said Joseph A. Grundfest, a business and law professor at Stanford and a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internal Revenue Service, meantime, recently opened an inquiry into the special trusts that are typically used to issue mortgage securities. A McKee Nelson spokeswoman declined to comment.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKee Nelson burst onto the scene in 1999 and quickly grabbed lucrative Wall Street work from long-established rivals. William F. Nelson, one of its co-founders, said the firm, which is known for its sophisticated tax work, did not employ any special legal maneuvers to outflank its competitors. ''There's no secret, magic elixir that we sprinkled,'' Mr. Nelson said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, the mortgage turmoil is now hitting the highly regarded McKee Nelson hard. The firm recently pared its structured finance department to 80 lawyers from about 115 through buyouts, sabbaticals and transfers to other departments. More cuts are unlikely, a spokeswoman said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Wall Street, the structured finance industry is hurting. Just this week   <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, which has lost billions of dollars on mortgage investments, said it would pull back from the business.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after profiting from the mortgage boom, McKee Nelson is now positioning itself to profit from the bust by riding the coming wave of lawsuits. In January, the firm flew its partners and their spouses to Charleston, S.C., aboard four Delta commuter jets, to map out its strategy.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're heavily committed to doing more litigation,'' Mr. Nelson said. The firm hopes to represent investment banks, hedge funds and other financial companies, as well as their executives, in a variety of litigation, he said.    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Bush administration and others have praised small business as the engine of American job creation, but small-company owners are being squeezed by the shaky economy and rising health costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their chief advocate, the Small Business Administration, has been criticized as ineffective by Democrats in Congress, by women who own businesses and by other advocacy groups. Its budget has also fallen by a third since 2000. But the agency is trying to revitalize itself under the leadership of Steven C. Preston, who took over in July 2006.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston, former executive vice president of  <span class="companylink">ServiceMaster</span>, outlined steps the agency is taking to aid small businesses. Here are excerpts from the interview:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.If the economy is headed for a serious downturn, or worse, how will this affect small business?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The indicators still show a fundamentally strong economy, but small businesses are seeing higher fuel costs, higher health care costs and potentially a slower growth. So the cost factors as well as some of these other issues are affecting them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What is the S.B.A. going to do to help small businesses grow?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We already guarantee about $75 billion worth of capital supporting small business. We and our resource partners train or counsel about one and a half million small businesses every year. We support small businesses in the process of getting about $80 billion worth of revenue from the federal procurement programs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens in a situation like we're seeing right now is that these types of services become even more critical because we help lenders make loans to small businesses that they wouldn't make loans to otherwise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Have you loosened any guidelines to make loans easier?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No, but what happens is that banks will use our loan guarantees if it is a business that maybe needs longer payback periods, or maybe an unconventional structure or may not quite meet their credit standards. So in a situation where banks are pulling back on credit somewhat, having our guarantee becomes more important in reaching those businesses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Can you do anything to push them to be more lenient?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We have a nationwide effort going on right now to spend time with banks to make sure that they are looking at using all of our products where they are relevant. I personally am getting involved in outreach to major banks to make sure they are helping get capital to small business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.The economic stimulus would double the amount small business can deduct for expenses. Why is this a good idea?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It encourages small businesses to make investments now, and provides them with the financial incentive to do so. And those investments fuel the economy. Secondly, they are making those investments to expand their business, or to leverage their employees through capital investments, or they're upgrading their equipment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Is S.B.A. proposing anything for the upcoming government budget to shore up small businesses?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The uncertainty about whether the tax cuts, which are set to expire in 2010, will be extended, is hurting small business right now in terms of investment and understanding what their ability to deploy cash is going to be. If those taxes go up, they're going to have less money to hire, less money to expand and less money to invest in their business.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another very important thing is putting in place policies that reduce health care costs for small business. The president has been a strong advocate of small-business health plans, which allow small businesses to band together and buy health care through buying groups. It's a simple way they can leverage size. In addition, he has proposed giving small businesses the same tax benefits that large businesses have in buying health care.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we need to open foreign markets for small business. Right now, for example, small businesses represent 35 percent of our exports to Colombia. We want to open those markets so small business can expand their revenue base and increase our competitiveness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why are these free trade agreements important?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. One reason is that they provide better intellectual property protection so if you've got a technology product or a knowledge-based product, you've got to make sure they're protected when they go overseas. And these agreements simplify the administrative process and make it faster to get goods over the border.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.What more can the agency do to counter criticism that it's not doing enough to help small businesses, particularly those that are female-owned, to win government contracts?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Our contracts to women-owned small businesses reached $11.6 billion in 2006, a record level. It was also the largest growth in history, by $1.5 billion. The federal government hasn't reached its 5 percent goal for purchase of its good and services from women-owned businesses, but we're hitting records every year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are holding more outreach events and events to match businesses with buyers. We also have goals for all district offices to hold those events, and those have been ratcheted up this year. We are also providing technology tools so agencies can find the right small-business vendor to meet their particular need, and putting more S.B.A. people on site with federal contractors. We retrained the entire field network to help small businesses in the contracting arena.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So we are doing more than we ever have before -- some of it's people, some of it's technology and some of it is extended outreach.   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Patty Stonesifer, who helped start the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in an office over a pizza parlor seven years ago and has overseen its growth it into the world's largest philanthropic institution, said in an interview on Wednesday that she would step down by the end of the year.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her decision marks a major turning point for the foundation, which has operated largely as a family foundation overseen by Ms. Stonesifer, a friend and confidante of Bill Gates, a co-founder of   <span class="companylink">Microsoft.</span></p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrival of a new chief executive, possibly an outsider, is the last step in the foundation's transition to a more orthodox institutional structure, with clearly defined divisions knit together by a central management team that Ms. Stonesifer has assembled over the last two years.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement is likely to surprise the world of philanthropy, which has watched the growth of the Gates Foundation with a mixture of awe, fear and envy.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $37 billion in assets, it is nearly four times the size of the next largest foundation. It dispenses more than $3 billion annually, more than five times the amount distributed by the Ford Foundation, and will have some 800 employees by year's end.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This job is mind-boggling because it requires a wholly different skill set than any other job in the philanthropic world,'' said Harvey P. Dale, a professor of philanthropy and nonprofit law at New York University. ''It's an enormous challenge.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stonesifer, 51, who has worked for a dollar a year after earning millions as a senior executive at   <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, said she was comfortable stepping down now because she believed the foundation had firmly established strategies for achieving its primary goals of improving health, education and nutrition around the world.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the right time,'' she said. ''We have a lot of momentum now, our strategies are in place, and it's time to take the organization to the next level where we deliver on those strategies.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, finding a replacement for Ms. Stonesifer will be a challenge because no one else has ever led a foundation of similar size and scale of ambition. The biggest goal for the Gateses is to find a vaccine that will prevent AIDS, but they also hope to eradicate malaria, spark an agricultural revolution in Africa and ensure that every child in the United States has access to a quality education, among other things.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's been an amazing culture keeper, not only in terms of selecting the more than 500 people we now have but also in creating a structure to keep that culture in place,'' Melinda Gates said of Ms. Stonesifer.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stonesifer's departure comes as the Gateses are increasing the time they spend on foundation matters. Ms. Gates now devotes roughly half her time to foundation affairs, and Mr. Gates will turn the bulk of his attention to foundation matters by Sept. 1, when he relinquishes some of his control over   <span class="companylink">Microsoft.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foundation is known for its insistence on an unprecedented level of continuing evaluation of its programs.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Ms. Gates gets a ''momentum'' report each month that summarizes the foundation's achievements and activities, and the foundation is working to publish a form of its internal progress reports on its Web site. It uses the information in those reports to win government support for its programs around the globe, where Mr. and Ms. Gates and the foundation's executive are often greeted with more ceremony than heads of state.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All those factors ensure that finding a replacement for Ms. Stonesifer will not be easy, although no doubt many will apply.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The phone will be ringing off the hook,'' said Allan C. Golston, president of the foundation's United States programs, which include improving education and reducing homelessness in Washington State.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Golston, who was one of the first people Ms. Stonesifer hired and who served for many years as the foundation's chief administrative officer, could be a candidate, though he did not say whether he would apply.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, now head of its global development program, could be a contender for the job. A former Clinton administration official, Ms. Burwell was hired early to serve as Ms. Stonesifer's second in command.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While acknowledging the possible internal candidates, Mr. Gates said the foundation planned to do a full external search for a successor.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be interesting to meet these people,'' he said. ''It may be difficult to tell some people 'no' who may think they should have the job.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unlikely, however, that any future executive will have the personal relationship Ms. Stonesifer has had with the Gates family and with Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who pledged the bulk of his fortune to the Gates Foundation in 2006 and is now a foundation trustee.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The daughter of an Indianapolis car salesman, Ms. Stonesifer is unassuming. Her speech is punctuated with a mixture of technological terms and homespun exclamations, like the ''holy cow!'' she uttered on learning of the Buffett gift.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pronouncement led to the Holy Cow award, an internal award passed from one staff member to another each month for work above and beyond the call of duty, and small stuffed toy cows are scattered around the foundation's offices.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stonesifer said she would assist in the selection of her successor and planned to maintain ties with the foundation, perhaps taking on a particular project. ''I'd like to get my hands dirty again,'' she said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was on her way to a job at Dreamworks, the entertainment company, in 1996 when Mr. and Ms. Gates began talking to her about taking over a project to put computers in public libraries. She agreed to a salary of $1 a year, turned the space over a now-defunct pizza parlor into the headquarters for the Gates Learning Foundation and started running the effort.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was really the perfect person for that,'' said Ms. Stonesifer, who is married to the political columnist Michael Kinsley. ''It was a discrete problem having to do with a gap in opportunity that could be solved with money and technology. Along the way, though, this particular family continued to see other problems that, with the right resources and our strengths, we could do something about.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the occasional lunches to compare notes with Mr. Gates's father, Bill Gates Sr., who was then running the William H. Gates Foundation out of his basement, were deemed inadequate, and the foundation in its current form was started in 2000 through a merger of the two existing entities.    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle -- Many communities dream of becoming the next Silicon Valley. This one is actually doing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stroll through the hip Fremont District and you will sense the Valley vibe. <span class="companylink">Google</span> recently opened a research lab here, its second in <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s backyard. Technology start-ups are sprouting up amid quirky neighborhood landmarks like a bronze statue of Lenin and the Fremont Troll, the giant concrete creature lurking beneath the George Washington Memorial Bridge.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More young companies are moving in downtown, near the art galleries and bookstores around Pioneer Square. Still others are spreading into the surrounding suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Seattle start-up ecosystem is vibrant, and growing rapidly,'' said Oren Etzioni, an artificial-intelligence expert at the University of Washington and a serial technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Washington, in fact, is one of the big draws. It is fostering the entrepreneurial climate here the way Stanford University does in Silicon Valley. Another advantage is the tech-savvy talent at the Seattle-based Amazon and nearby <span class="companylink">Microsoft.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> offshoots, sometimes called Baby Bills, after Bill Gates of <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, are being joined by Amazon progeny called Baby Jeffs, for Amazon's Jeffrey P. Bezos. Baby Sergeys -- those formed by veterans of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., and was co-founded by Sergey Brin -- are opening here, too, Mr. Etzioni said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of entrepreneurs and of venture capitalists to bankroll them is slowly reshaping this city and a regional economy long buffeted by the booms and busts of the aerospace and timber industries. A start-up ecosystem needs social networks, support businesses and a business culture that views failure as a badge of honor, not shame. All of that is in place in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom A. Alberg, a partner at the <span class="companylink">Madrona Venture Group</span>, one of Seattle's leading venture capital firms and an early investor in Amazon, says the city is now home to a growing community of technology innovators who are willing to take risks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People were more risk-averse in the '80s,'' said Mr. Alberg, who is on the board at Amazon. Madrona lost money on HomeGrocer, the Seattle-based online grocery service, he said, ''but if you never invest in a HomeGrocer, you will never invest in an Amazon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money is pouring in. During the last 12 years, venture capital investment here has more than tripled, to about $1 billion annually. Last year Washington tied with Texas as the third-largest destination for venture capital money nationwide, behind California and Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crucial part of the chemistry is the University of Washington, in particular its computer science and electrical engineering departments. Washington State ranks first nationally in engineers employed for every 10,000 workers and in percent of total payroll in high technology. And then there are Amazon, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and their offspring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now tons of companies are spinning off people,'' said Ed Lazowska, a computer scientist who holds the Bill and Melinda Gates Chair at the University of Washington. Veterans from Amazon, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, <span class="companylink">RealNetworks</span> and other established companies are leaving to form start-ups and venture funds, he said. ''We're finally at the stage of becoming a perpetual-motion machine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several generations of start-ups are beginning to cross-fertilize, fostering the kind of rapid growth seen in biological systems, said Mr. Etzioni, whose latest venture, Farecast, uses data-mining techniques to anticipate fluctuations in airfares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example of the growing start-up economy is Jackson Fish Market, a Web software company founded by three veteran <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> software designers. Inside a windowless loft in Pioneer Square, the company is now working on starting its third advertising-supported Web service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The start-up culture ''is beginning to work now,'' said Walter Smith, one of Jackson's founders, who worked on <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s Vista operating system but left before it was introduced. ''Seattle is like an adolescent version of Silicon Valley.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Etzioni says Seattle has at least one advantage over its storied counterpart in California. ''People aren't distracted by too much sunshine,'' he said. ''They sit in their offices or garages and get creative.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses, large and small, will be directly helped by the new economic stimulus legislation passed by Congress last week. But small businesses, in particular, may get the biggest lift indirectly -- from consumers spending their tax rebates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $168 billion measure, which was approved by both houses of Congress with uncommon swiftness, includes rebates for taxpayers and incentives for businesses, all intended to bolster the sagging economy. President Bush is expected to sign it this week.   </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bars, restaurants and other retailers are counting on increased business from consumers who will start getting their tax rebate checks in May. ''That's where small businesses will benefit the most,'' said Barbara Weltman, a lawyer and small-business tax specialist in Millwood, N.Y.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller companies like Dahm Trucking in Woodstock, Ill., and McCutcheon's Apple Products in Frederick, Md., are poised to benefit from the provisions aimed at businesses. The National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy group in Washington, lobbied on their behalf.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are doing better than the rest of the economy,'' said Dan Danner, the group's executive vice president. ''They are one sector that continues to create jobs, but they are not doing as good as they could do. If you're going to stimulate the economy, this is the group to help.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation helps businesses in two ways. It gives companies a 50 percent bonus deduction on new equipment that would normally be depreciated over many years. And it increases -- to $250,000 from $128,000 in 2008 -- the limit on expenses that small businesses can deduct from annual income, with a total cap of $800,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a small business like Dahm Trucking, which has annual revenue over $5 million, the most valuable provision is the increased expensing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Chris Dahm, its president, said he could buy three trailers, at $100,000 apiece. That means Mr. Dahm can enter contracts with three independent owner-operator truck drivers to haul goods on the trailers, and add a person to his two-member office staff. ''It's going to help us out quite a bit,'' he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had there been no government intervention, he said, he would have had to just ''sit and wait to see what happens.'' Expansion would have been out of the question, he added, while layoffs were possible.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business was ''very poor'' in the fourth quarter, Mr. Dahm said, and so far this year, ''it has been a disaster.'' While some of the slowdown is seasonal, he said, steel shipments have dropped sharply. That also happened during recessions in the 1980s and early '90s.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Danner of the advocacy group said many more smaller companies that are in a position to invest in office equipment, vehicles, machinery, and the like would do so.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCutcheon's Apple Products, which is in the process of completing a major retail expansion, will take advantage of the bonus depreciation, an owner, Bob McCutcheon, said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are looking to spend up to $6.5 million on our building,'' he said. ''The accelerated depreciation will mean we will pay less taxes for quite some time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of depreciating the cost over a longer period, the family-run business can deduct 50 percent of the total cost this year and the normal depreciation of the remaining cost. ''It will give us a lot of money to hire more people and upgrade other systems,'' Mr. McCutcheon said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Weltman cautioned owners to talk to their tax advisers to see if their businesses would be eligible to take advantage of the new provisions. ''It's a huge deal for some businesses,'' she said, ''but how many small businesses spend $250,000 a year for equipment?''   </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web site for Sophia Brodsky's day spa in Philadelphia, the Body Klinic, was pretty rudimentary until a college student walked into the spa a little more than two years ago with an irresistible offer.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she tells it, the student, Nathaniel Stevens, said that for $10 he would take her existing site and redesign it to drive traffic to her salon. If she got more business, they agreed, he would get additional money. Ms. Brodsky, a Russian immigrant whose interests run more to cranberry facials than the Internet, thought why not.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brodsky now maintains three Web sites and estimates that they have brought in thousands of dollars in business. ''Now,'' she said, ''people are coming to my Web site daily.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small-business owners like Ms. Brodsky who have a Web presence are still a minority. In its first survey of small-business Web sites last April, Jupiter Research found that just 36 percent of all businesses with fewer than 100 employees had a Web presence.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Web as an alternative yellow pages, along with blogs and social networking, is drawing increased attention. The Kelsey Group, a market research company in Princeton, N.J., estimates sales revenue from Internet yellow pages, searches for local businesses and searches on wireless devices will increase to $13 billion in 2010 from $3.4 billion in 2005. Those small-business owners who venture online say the experience is generally worth it though the learning curve may be steep. Recognizing this, online advertising companies with names like Yodle, Weblistic, WebVisible and ReachLocal are springing up to help in managing the sites.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web was not on Ms. Brodsky's mind when she put down $165,000 in 2004 in the Rittenhouse Square area for a spa that grossed about $6,000 a week. The spa was not even computerized at the time and had a staff of seven that she felt was not adequately trained for the upscale clientele she wanted to serve.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts generally advise small-business owners not to establish a Web presence unless they have time to keep it updated. Jean A. Pratt, assistant professor of information systems at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, said, ''If someone doesn't maintain a Web site, it does become more of a detriment because competitors are keen on making theirs part of a marketing strategy.'' A static site may damage the credibility of the business, she added.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jody DeVere, president of askpatty.com, an automotive advice site for women that started in 2006, said she was determined not to let that happen when she was developing the site. To avoid spending $50 to $200 an hour for a Web developer, she spent several weeks learning how to blog, which included posting feature articles and tagging entries properly.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To gauge the site's effectiveness she enlisted a group of 20 women, including her daughter and two daughters-in-law; forwarded links; and asked for comments.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reaction was positive though at least one participant said she was not sure what she was viewing, asking, ''Is the site geared for women's questions about the car business?''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Krug, author of a Web usability guide, ''Don't Make Me Think'' (New Riders Press, 2000), says what looks great to a business owner may be totally lost on a user unfamiliar with the site. He suggests business owners watch their site being tested, devoting several hours a month to the effort.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a feeling K. Rudolph knows well. She runs Native Intelligence Inc. in Bethesda, Md., which sells computer security and security awareness training courses.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company started a Web site about a decade ago; she took a workshop based on Mr. Krug's book in 2003.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his presentation Mr. Krug singled out her site's graphics and asked participants if they knew what business Native Intelligence was in. The first person to answer thought bright colors and cartoons meant it was designed for children. ''Watching someone use your site for the first time can be a humbling and enlightening experience,'' she said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rudolph and her business partner at the time, Sam Carter, spent about three-quarters of their time over the next two weeks totally revamping the site trying to answer questions Mr. Krug posed like, ''What can I do on this site?''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ms. Rudolph sets aside several hours a month to watch as many as three users in succession navigate links on the site. She enlists friends and acquaintances to cast a critical eye.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Native Intelligence has prospered since the site was revamped in 2003. The company's gross income rose to $1,094,000 in 2006 from $483,000 in 2003, although Ms. Rudolph acknowledges she does not know how much of the increase was a result of the Web site improvements.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Kodner, the chief executive of the Crack Team, a basement repair company in St. Louis, says he is happy with his site just the way it is.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home page is distinguished by the presence of Mr. Happy Crack, the company's anthropomorphic mascot. There are links to pictures of easily recognized individuals including former President Richard M. Nixon who are wearing Mr. Happy Crack apparel and links to merchandise available for purchase. ''I view it as a commercial that plays around the world 24 hours a day, seven days a week,'' he said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kodner said the Web site's links to the apparel bring in about $500,000 a year, about 5 percent of the company's revenue.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts say Mr. Kodner may be able to do more with his Web site and they note that the use of an article like ''the'' in a Web address may also be confusing. Searchers who forget to include ''the'' may be misdirected to a search engine before giving up.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jakob Nielsen, a consultant on Web use, says small-business owners also need to be aware of differing customer sensibilities when using humor. ''At some point humor becomes dangerous because it's hard to get right,'' he said. ''The border is very fine.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kodner is not persuaded. ''The worst response is apathy,'' he said. ''We want people to remember us.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brodsky, the spa owner, said she used to favor winning customer recognition by developing new product offerings. But Mr. Stevens, the student who was starting an Internet company, showed her that a versatile Web presence was also crucial. Mr. Stevens created two Web sites that mirrored each other. One,    www.thebodyklinic.com   [http://www.thebodyklinic.com], features a local telephone number, and currently a picture of a brownstone and clickable foliage that leads to the spa's various services. The site has generated a 10 percent increase in sales since Ms. Brodsky -- now a Web convert -- last redesigned it in October.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its not-quite mirror double,    www.thebodyklinic.net   [http://www.thebodyklinic.net]. features an 888 toll-free number and was intended to help track calls. Mr. Stevens and Ms. Brodsky agreed that she would pay him for each individual click on the site. Her phone calls on that line are monitored so she can tell how much customer traffic the site is generating. (Ms. Brodsky currently maintains a third site,    www.thebodyklinic.biz   [http://www.thebodyklinic.biz], which she intends to use in the future.)    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her Web budget has grown to about $1,000 a month, Ms. Brodsky said, but her weekly gross is now $8,000 to $10,000 a week, up from $7,000 in the last two years.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stevens took a leave of absence from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The company he started, now named Yodle, obtained venture capital and has expanded beyond Philadelphia to 17 other cities.    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 2005, meal assembly shops were the hottest trend in small business, a concept taken on with gusto by mom-and-pop entrepreneurs. In storefront and shopping-center kitchens nationwide, they sold millions of uncooked entrees in freezer-ready Ziplocs and to-go tins, with stick-on instructions for boiling, simmering, baking or stir-frying the contents into quick dinners at home.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept boomed, as the number of stores mushroomed from four in 2002 to 1,400 in 2007, almost exclusively by catering to women who wanted to provide home-cooked meals for their families, according to the Easy Meal Preparation Association.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The customers placed their orders online days ahead, paid about $200 for 12 meals and donned store-supplied aprons to personally assemble each dish at the site one or two times a month. They adjusted the recipes to their families' tastes, maybe leaving the chopped onions out of the enchiladas. They often came with friends, sipped glasses of wine as they worked and treated the two-hour assembly sessions as guilt-free nights out.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loyalty of these wives and mothers landed meal assembly companies on various lists of top franchises and hot new businesses throughout 2005 and 2006.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But growth in the industry has slowed sharply, long before reaching expectations. Industry revenue, which two years ago was forecast to reach $1 billion annually by 2010, is now projected around $650 million by then, said Bert Vermeulen, an industry consultant and founder of the easy meal association.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 264 meal preparation stores closed during 2007, Mr. Vermeulen said, more than three times as many as in the previous year. He forecasts fewer than 50 openings in the United States this year, compared with 562 in 2006.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that lots of people are simply not motivated to plan so many meals in advance. The desire for last-minute convenience remains powerful in America, often trumping the more ephemeral rewards of home cooking.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding themselves ill prepared to offer such convenience in the context of a business model built on prescheduled two-hour sessions, meal assembly owners are trying to find new ways to bring ready-to-cook meals to the masses.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical customers ''were women who enjoyed the time away from the kids -- getting out, having a glass of wine -- because they felt good about taking care of their families' meals,'' said Bill Byrd, chief executive of Super Suppers, the second-largest franchiser in the business. ''What we found is that the market wasn't as big as we thought it was.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Super Suppers, which is based in Fort Worth, once forecast it would have 600 stores by the end of 2006; it now has about 200. Dream Dinners, based in Snohomish, Wash., originated the concept. It has 236 stores, not quite meeting expectations. No single competitor of Super Suppers and Dream Dinners has more than 70 stores.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of owners bring in less than $25,000 a month, or $300,000 a year, in revenue, according to Mr. Vermeulen's data. He figures that is about $5,000 a month short of what they need to stay out of financial trouble.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Book It N Cook It, an independent store in the Tampa, Fla., suburb of Lutz, never exceeded $4,000 in monthly revenue in its eight-month life, said Terry Warner, its former owner. Monthly expenses averaged about $7,500. Mrs. Warner and her husband closed the store in November after losing about $250,000.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Warners, retired insurance adjusters who spent two years studying the industry before jumping in, say they underestimated the public's aversion to meal planning.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People here have a grab-and-go mentality,'' Mrs. Warner said of Florida, where free time can be spent outdoors year-round. ''The last thing anyone wants to do here is plan dinner.'' She said that the burger joint next door to her shop seemed to be doing great.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Book It N Cook It did keep preassembled meals ready for walk-in customers, but Mrs. Warner said that attracting foot traffic was difficult.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is selling more preassembled uncooked meals. In 2008, Mr. Vermeulen forecasts, store employees will assemble more meals than customers will for the first time. In 2004, customers in prebooked sessions assembled about 90 percent of all meals sold.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dinner by Design, the third-largest franchiser, expects to get out of the session business completely, said John Matthews, chief executive of the company, which is based in Grayslake, Ill.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dinner by Design renovated a store in Gurnee, Ill., to sell only preassembled uncooked entrees, side orders and desserts for pickup or delivery. Customers can phone in to pick up meals, order online or buy from the store's fridge.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Matthews, who came to meal assembly after building sandwich and pizza franchise companies, hopes to copy the model throughout the chain.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a huge market that is not going to book a session,'' he said, including his wife. ''She wanted to know why we don't have drive-through windows.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deeelish (yes, three e's), based in Menlo Park, Calif., runs meal assembly sessions but is expanding mainly through delivery. For a $25 additional fee, the store will send frozen, uncooked meals by overnight delivery via   <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> to homes in several Western states.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The   <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> program is a small part of Deeelish's more than $1 million in annual revenue, said Jeff Stevens, a co-owner. But he expects corporate deliveries, in which office workers preorder meals to take home, will account for half of sales by the end of the year. Deeelish trucks fresh (not frozen) meals to commercial refrigerators it has installed in three office buildings so far.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone thinks that preassembled meals will be the salvation. ''We think a lot of the rush to change has been from lack of success with the core business,'' said Erik Ginsberg, referring to the sessions. Mr. Ginsberg is president of a Baltimore partnership that owns some of the highest revenue-generating stores in the business. ''That hasn't been our experience.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average annual sales for all his nine stores -- called Let's Dish, although independent of that franchise -- is about $1.3 million, Mr. Ginsberg said. About 85 percent of sales come from traditional session customers, a percentage he expects will shrink but remain the majority of business.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dream Dinners' stores rely solely on preordered meals, mainly assembled by session customers. Darin Leonard, the chief executive, argued that his competitors blundered in chasing the grab-and-go business, which he says turned their $200-a-month session customers into $50-a-month pickup customers.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite moving toward pickup sales, the industry strives to set itself apart from fast food. Mr. Byrd of Super Suppers pointed out that his meals were healthier than most takeout fare and cheaper than those in casual restaurants. That's true even if Mom had nothing to do with making them.    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR those who have started their own business or are thinking of doing so, there's inspiration, comfort, camaraderie -- as well as nitty-gritty advice -- online. Dozens of blogs offer small-business owners and entrepreneurs free start-up tips and business advice -- much of it drawn from their creators' experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blogs include the inspirational and motivational, for those who are thinking about chucking corporate life and going out on their own. One of these is escapefromcubiclenation.com, where Pamela S. Slim, a former leadership development consultant, writes about traits that fence-sitters should consider about themselves -- like their working styles and finances -- before deciding whether to take the leap into self-employment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade advising corporations like the networking systems supplier Cisco Systems, Ms. Slim decided in 2006 that she wanted to switch her focus to helping people who were pondering the idea of striking out on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her first posting, Ms. Slim, 41, castigated corporations for how they treated their workers and pledged to lure their ''brightest, most creative, hard-working and passionate employees'' to the self-employed life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end of the spectrum are blogs offering practical advice, like franchisepundit.com, where a Chicago lawyer, Ryan M. Knoll, 32, helps his readers navigate the sometimes treacherous waters of franchise ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Mr. Knoll decided to post his research into buying a franchise, a deal he eventually decided not to pursue. Instead, he went to law school but continued the blog, where he lists specifics like the 10 most common mistakes in buying a franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also gives thumbs up or down to some popular franchise picks, and his advice can be blunt. His blog -- which readers contribute to -- tries to point out potential franchise problems and steer his audience clear of losers. For example, he flagged <span class="companylink">eBay</span> retail stores, which were ''exploding over the last five years,'' as potentially troublesome for a long-term investment. ''Now they're all closing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those already running small businesses are the audience for Anita P. Campbell's blog, smallbiztrends.com, which she began in 2003. It draws some 100,000 readers monthly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of her most popular entries recently have been about how to avoid employee embezzlement, top marketing secrets and what to do if your Web site is hacked -- like hers was once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also posts guest columns from small-business experts. But mostly Ms. Campbell, who operates from Medina, Ohio, tries to talk about ''real-life situations to make blogging more real and valuable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who want to skip the corporate trenches and go right to being the boss, there is younggogetter.com, run by three small-business owners in their 20s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is Aaron Kuroiwa, who operates LeTranslator, an online business and legal language translation service, and gives concrete advice -- like his recent posting of three steps to becoming more productive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While blogs can motivate those who are thinking about taking the plunge into self employment -- or offer an online shoulder for those reeling under the time demands of running their own business and the lack of a paycheck -- they can also be a marketing tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Slim, for example, said she got enough interest from readers that she was able to earn a living by coaching them on how to leave the corporate suite and become their own boss.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN Los Angeles, a corporation that runs several small businesses is demonstrating that the training and discipline of working in a small company can make a big contribution to changing the lives of former gang members.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The corporation, Homeboy Industries, runs a silkscreen business, for example, that produced revenue of $1.1 million last year from sales of custom T-shirts and other apparel for radio stations running promotions and college and private groups holding events. The business employs former gang members to make the T-shirts and uses the money to help offset the corporation's expenses. Homeboy Silkscreen started 12 years ago in a converted warehouse under a freeway overpass near downtown Los Angeles and now has 18 employees.    </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeboy Bakery has a new plant that has $3 million in ovens and machinery and its managers hope to produce millions of dollars in revenue within a year or two, said the master baker, Alvaro Ocegueda. He supervises 25 former gang members who have become bakers under his guidance and with professional training at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College, a two-year community college.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a Homegirl Cafe, that has a staff of 27 girls who were ''gang impacted'' either as auxiliary gang members or as residents of neighborhoods under gang influence. The cafe has brought in more than $220,000 in five months of serving breakfast and lunch six days a week, said Patricia Zarate, who cooks for and manages the business.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeboy Maintenance takes in about $6,000 a month, and a Homeboy retail store sold $25,000 in Homeboy shirts and caps in a recent three-month period.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it may sound like a budding conglomerate, Homeboy is a nonprofit charitable corporation that last year had a budget of $5 million and goals that emphasize rehabilitation over revenue.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The aim of the cash-producing businesses is that they bring in enough to pay for the free services,'' said the Rev. Gregory Boyle, a Jesuit priest who founded Homeboy Industries in East Los Angeles two decades ago and is now its executive director. Those services include mental therapy for former gang members, housing assistance, job development counseling and tattoo removal treatments.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tattoo removals are not a fashion statement but a safety concern. Gang tattoos are a marker of the rivalries among the 26,000 members of Los Angeles's 250 gangs, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Many gangs have been in existence for decades, and, police department figures show, their activities in the last five years have resulted in 12,000 assaults, 10,000 robberies, 784 homicides and 500 rapes.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, when he was assigned to Dolores Mission Church, the poorest parish in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles , Father Boyle decided to try employment as a way to break the cycle of gangs, crime and imprisonment for the neighborhood's young men. He tried to persuade businesses to hire reforming gang members through a parish organization he called Jobs for a Future. Then, in 1992, he bought an abandoned bakery with a contribution from Ray Stark, the Hollywood producer (''Funny Girl,'', ''California Suite,'' and ''Annie'' among others). Father Boyle put a half dozen former gang members -- ''homeboys'' in street parlance -- to work cleaning up the bakery and producing tortillas for sale. Tortilla sales led to making bread for a large baking company that supplied restaurants.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ultimately led to Homeboy bakers being trained at Mi Vida-My Life, a family bakery run by Mr. Ocegueda, who tutored them in the mystical tradition of baking. ''You knead the dough by hand and all of the tensions and the spirit you are feeling go into the bread,'' Mr. Ocegueda said in an interview.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeboy Bakery was offered a grant to buy an automatic dough mixer, Mr. Ocegueda said. ''But Father Greg said no, it is better to have them knead by hand because we can employ more people.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assignment seems anachronistic because Homeboy Bakery, with its gleaming new ovens and storage bins, is now housed in the Fran and Ray Stark Homeboy Industries headquarters, an $8.5 million center built with philanthropic contributions and opened last October.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Homeboy's emphasis is on putting gang members to work. ''Our most important task is job training,'' Father Boyle said in a telephone interview from Italy, where he is on a three-month sabbatical to write a book on Homeboy's work in reclaiming lives. Indeed, Mr. Ocegueda's assignment is to double the number of Homeboy bakers to 50 next year. The jobs pay $9 to $10 an hour, with health benefits after the employee is on the job three months. The aim is to introduce gang members to the discipline of work and eventually to graduate them to jobs in the commercial marketplace.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Homeboy organization conducts thousands of job development interviews every year, with Father Boyle seeing more than 50 people a day. In his current absence, the chief operating officer, Veronica Vargas, is taking on that work. The organization is now compiling a database of all the people who have been helped or treated through the years, said Mona Hobson, director of development.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organization is also anticipating expansion. The new Homeboy headquarters, a few blocks from Los Angeles City Hall, ''gives us a chance to reach out to African-American gangs; our focus is countywide,'' Father Boyle said.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new center has spurred ideas for growth among supervisors of the businesses, some of whom were once troubled youths but not gang members. ''I was a tagger,'' a graffiti painter, said Rosaliano Mendez, who heads the maintenance business. ''I dropped out of school, but I went back and now I'm studying for an associate degree in business.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mendez sees opportunity for expansion in commercial office cleaning. Eric Bennett, who heads the retail operation, said he ''met Father Greg when I was in some trouble.'' Mr. Bennett said he was hopeful that ''we can spread the Homeboy brand in off- campus stores not only in California but across the country.''    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeboy Industries' board, whose members are business and professional people, would like to see expansion. ''I think the bakery should be bringing in $4 million to $5 million in revenue per year,'' said David Adams, the chairman of real estate investment firms in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles and the chief fund-raiser for the new Homeboy headquarters.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, the bakery is close to signing a big order for bread and pastries from a chain of coffeehouse restaurants and is seeking other big customers.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruben Rodriguez, who with his wife, Cristina, heads the silk screen business, also says he believes expansion is possible. A big factor for Mr. Rodriguez, one of the longest-serving Homeboy supervisors -- ''I met Father Greg at a bad time in my life.'' -- is that ''Father Greg does all the marketing'' for Homeboy products and services.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A question for Homeboy Industries, which is common to all small businesses, is whether the company could go on and prosper without its entrepreneurial founder. Father Boyle, 54 and healthy today, survived leukemia six years ago.    </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Several years ago, I might have doubted that it could,'' said Michael Hennigan, president of the Homeboy directors and founder of a Los Angeles law firm. ''But today I think the organization is large enough and talent from the Jesuit order and elsewhere would come forward. The organization will go on and prosper.''    </p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF there is one issue that divides the self-employed from all other employees, it is their preoccupation with the subject of health insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was reminded of this on Feb. 14, when I wrote a post on the Shifting Careers blog asking small-business owners and would-be entrepreneurs what they were doing about health insurance. Within hours, scores of people posted comments about their own experiences and, if they had managed to find good resources, shared those. I have been reading e-mail messages and trying to make sense of the subject ever since. In short, it is not pretty out there.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 43-year-old woman wrote about going without insurance in the first year of her business. ''I lived in terror of needing a doctor visit or worse yet, lab tests or something more,'' she said. She then moved to an H.M.O. for sole proprietors through a local chamber of commerce. The cost of that plan, which she said was $171 a month in 2001, has now risen to $500 a month. At the same time, she wrote, co-payments have increased and services have been cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That woman's experience reflected the exasperated tone of several of the other writers. Many entrepreneurs seem to find health insurance after doing a lot of research, though they generally pay more than they think they should. Some who are in good health bet on remaining that way and forgo health insurance or get policies with low premiums and high deductibles, choosing to insure themselves for mostly catastrophic illness. Some are lucky enough to have a well-insured partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unluckiest are those with chronic illnesses or the dreaded pre-existing condition that results in a denial of coverage. Many of these people abandon dreams of entrepreneurship altogether because they need jobs that come with a health plan and they cannot find a way to self-insure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments also revealed that the health care system is a state-by-state patchwork, with options varying based on where you live. A 60-year-old owner of a mail order business from Illinois wrote that she was unable to get insurance until about 10 years ago when Illinois started a high-risk pool with Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woman in business with her 57-year-old husband wrote to say that her husband is presently uninsured because, as a diabetic with high blood pressure, she cannot find an insurance company in Florida that will cover him. The stories go on. There were reports from Americans happily insured while living in Europe and Canada. And, of course, there were numerous pleas to Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Jaff, a reader who happens to be an expert on health insurance issues, shared a valuable tool, healthinsuranceinfo.net. The site, maintained by the Georgetown Health Policy Institute, shows a map of the country and after clicking on a state, a document is downloaded that covers everything from what kinds of programs are available to small-business owners to whether there is a high-risk pool available for those who have been rejected by insurance providers. These primers are comprehensive and frequently updated, and they are a great place to start, especially if you have been wondering about the meaning of jargon that peppers insurance providers' descriptions of their offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many readers shared recommendations based on where they buy their insurance. Popular sources were local chambers of commerce, the Small Business Service Bureau (sbsb.com), AARP (aarp.org) (for those over 50), local chambers of commerce, industry-specific trade associations like a bar association or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. In states that permit it, small-business owners can also start a group with as little as one member. In that case, a good insurance agent comes in handy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the reasonably healthy who know what they are looking for, ehealthinsurance.com got fairly good reviews. The site, which has the feel of an <span class="companylink">Expedia</span> or Orbitz for purchasing health insurance, allows you to compare a variety of policies offered through about 70 insurance providers. One caveat, pointed out by several readers, is that ehealthinsurance.com does not serve consumers in all states. Rhode Island, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine and North Dakota are excluded. The company also covers only individuals. So if your company has employees, you will need to explore other options, like starting a group if your state permits that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility for consultants and independent workers is the Freelancers Union, which won consistently good reviews in the reader comments. But the union also has some limitations. It operates in only 30 states, and you have to work in one of the industries or occupations it serves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While healthy business owners have to incur high costs and navigate a maze of choices, the truly unhealthy face the biggest challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To learn more about options for those whose health is getting in the way of their self-employment, I spoke with Jennifer Jaff, the woman who directed me to healthinsuranceinfo.net. Ms. Jaff, a lawyer who has worked on legal issues surrounding health care in both the public and private sector, now runs Advocacy for Patients With Chronic Illness (advocacyforpatients.org), a nonprofit organization in Farmington, Conn., that advises and advocates on behalf of the chronically ill. She says she works with about 1,000 patients a year, handling everything from battles to get insurance companies to pay for treatments prescribed by patients' doctors to helping people figure out the best coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jaff speaks from experience. She suffers from Crohn's disease, a condition so severe that she does not leave her house during flare-ups except to get to a doctor's appointment or to the hospital. She wanted to find something she could do out of her home and as she went through the challenge of finding her own health insurance, she discovered what she calls ''a community of patients in desperate need of help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jaff qualified for the Municipal Employees Health Insurance Program, offered by Connecticut to cover small-business owners as part of a plan for state employees. She knew about the plan, which she recommends to all small- business owners in Connecticut, from her days as a lawyer in the attorney general's office. Even with her extensive experience, Ms. Jaff has not been able to find the holy grail -- good coverage at a great price. When she started on this insurance, her premium was $400 a month. Last year, the monthly payment went up to $800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know if people who don't have chronic illnesses can really understand this,'' she said. ''But I have worked full time my entire adult life -- generally 15 to 18 hours a day. I have paid into the system for all those years. And there is only one thing that could bankrupt me, and it is my health. I could lose every penny I own from one serious hospitalization without insurance. So I chose the plan that would give me the most possible coverage because the year I don't is going to be the year I get really sick.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Thursday about the small-business opposition to some federal tax proposals referred incorrectly to people to whom the businesses must now supply 1099 forms, which are used to report payments over $600. The forms are provided to independent contractors, not employees. (Employees receive W-2 forms.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Apr 16 2008 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for small businesses are fighting changes in tax laws that the Bush administration says are aimed at cracking down on tax cheating, particularly by the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the changes proposed by the Treasury Department are directed toward small-business owners but the ones that do, those representing small business argue, will create a mountain of new paperwork that will be cumbersome and costly.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One proposal, part of President Bush's budget, would require detailed reporting of credit card transactions to the Internal Revenue Service. Another would require most owners of small businesses to report any payments above $600 to corporations, like <span class="companylink">Federal Express</span>, for services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has proposed such measures before, but Congress has not gone along, mainly because lawmakers are not anxious to associate their names with tax proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one important change was added in closed-door budget negotiations in 2006 requiring federal, state and local agencies to withhold a percentage of payments from contractors -- touching everything from the cleaning of schools to the paving of roads to supplying military uniforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rule does not take effect until 2011 but its passage lit a fire under small-business groups who say it is unfair and who are fighting for its repeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is our No. 1 priority issue for this Congress,'' said Molly Brogan, a spokeswoman for the National Small Business Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy slumping, Congress could once again adopt last-minute measures to raise revenue. A growing number of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, want to pay for new spending by closing what is known as the ''tax gap'' -- the shortfall of some $300 billion in uncollected taxes. The government says that at least $100 billion of that comes from underreporting by the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small-business lobbyists say small enterprises are already overburdened by current requirements for tax withholding, record-keeping and reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some fraudulent actors,'' conceded Grafton Willey IV, a principal in Tofias P.C., a certified public accounting firm, a former chairman of the small-business association. ''But most of the so-called tax gap comes from the extraordinary complexity of the tax code.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual merchants say the reporting of credit card receipts will add significantly to their paperwork, and make it easy for the I.R.S. to initiate audits if credit card totals do not match what the small-business owner reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online sellers, like Evan Prytherch, who operates a musical instruments and accessories Web site called evanp.com, say such a requirement will fall most heavily on them because their sales are almost totally by credit card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And returns are a big part of our business,'' he said, ''so the yearly total can be very different when returns and things like people who don't pay are taken into account.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, he said, he would have to match each entry with the paper receipt to make sure it had been paid and was accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're talking a book-size reporting effort,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More worrisome to some small companies is the Treasury Department proposal that businesses report payments to corporations over $600. Businesses are already required to provide a 1099 Form for employees. Expanding that to corporations, small-business groups argue, will add paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do business with hundreds of corporations, but I don't keep my books by company,'' said Eric Blackledge, owner of Blackledge Furniture in Corvallis, Ore. ''We're a typical small business, and like most, I keep them by accounts such as business supplies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blackledge, the fourth generation to run the residential and office furniture supplier, said he ''would have to redo my entire accounting system to keep track of this, and it would be a tremendous expense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department plans to push Congress to add its measures to coming legislation. The credit card provision alone ''is expected over a 10-year period to bring in $18.7 billion in taxes that would otherwise not be collected,'' said a department spokesman, Anthony C. DeSouza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business advocates like the Coalition for Fairness in Tax Compliance, formed in 2006 by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business Legislative Council, say they will continue to battle such measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Paperwork burdens and regulatory requirements already are big concerns for small business,'' said Giovanni Coratolo, small-business director at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''This would be adding something new that would cost more money for businesses which are already in compliance.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make sure boards are truly diverse, companies need to take a director's personality into account when they look to add a member or upgrade their performance, two psychologists say in Directors and Boards.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, boards ''consider an individual's title, industry background and functional expertise,'' the psychologists, Peter G. Spanberger and Susan M. Jackson, wrote. ''They also look to achieve a diversity of gender and ethnicity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that, they contend, is not enough to achieve ''diversity at its broadest level.'' A well-functioning board needs a diversity of personalities, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Highly opinionated, forceful individuals are just as important to the group process as those who are consensus-driven,'' they write. ''Creative risk-takers need to be balanced with cautious, detailed thinkers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, of course, is if the board makes sure that each personality type is countered by its opposite, nothing may get done, or board members will spend all their time fighting with one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors concede that, but respond that having these differing personality types is beneficial, if managed properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A creative board member can offer new insights and considerations that may expand the board's thinking,'' they say. ''Another board member can remain cautious and careful and prevent the board from straying too far from important basics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TYPES A TO D Writing in Entrepreneur, Robert Kiyosaki argues there are only four personality types found in any organization:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who want to be liked. ''These are the social directors who want everyone to be happy, especially with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who want to be comfortable. They want job security. They will do a good job, ''but don't expect them to stretch or push themselves'' or to respond well to pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who want to be right. ''These people are strong in their opinions and will defend their ideas to the death.'' They can be reluctant to accept other points of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who want to win. They have the ''drive and tenacity'' to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kiyosaki says no one type is better than another. ''Understanding them -- as well as yourself, your strengths and what inspires you -- is the foundation for long-term growth and success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRADUAL CHANGE How can leaders avoid putting their companies through a major reorganization? The answer, according to two management professors at Texas A&amp;M, is to make sure the company never needs one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two, John Humphreys and Hal Langford, write in Sloan Management Review that ''out of inertia, some managers maintain the status quo'' until noticeable problems ''escalate into predicaments'' that require radical change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems can be spotted relatively early, they say, by paying attention to signs like rising turnover, ''rampant tardiness'' and a drop in quality. Asking three basic questions may help put the company back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, how will the company look different in the future? What will the organization have to do to respond to competitive, consumer or demographic changes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, what will be the consequences of making those changes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, what can the company do about the challenges the answers to Questions 1 and 2 are going to create?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as you know what you are up against, you can always manage it,'' they write.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about a new generation of developers leaving their mark on Las Vegas misidentified the university at which Lorenzo Fertitta, a son of the founder of Station Casinos, befriended Thomas C. Breitling, part of a group that bought and later sold the Golden Nugget. It was at the University of San Diego, not the University of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Mon May 12 2008 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- A few Fridays ago, George Maloof Jr. was driving out of town when he stopped to look back down at the mammoth bowl of glittering lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that perch, Mr. Maloof was awed by the three slender towers of the Palms Hotel-Casino standing in the foreground of the Strip, all lit up and busily receiving young hipsters and celebrities for another happening weekend.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a charge to see that,'' he recalled. ''That was one of the first times I really felt, 'Wow -- I did that.' And I was proud of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Odds are good that at 43, Mr. Maloof and other Vegas entrepreneurs his age and younger have a lot more success coming. Whereas to most Vegas enthusiasts, names like Steve Wynn, Kirk Kerkorian and Sheldon Adelson are synonymous with the city's most famous resorts, a new generation is poised to take over as the architects of a city under constant renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These kids are just so smart,'' said Mr. Wynn, 66, the chairman of <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> and developer of the Mirage, Bellagio and <span class="companylink">Wynn Las Vegas</span> resorts. He arrived here himself at 24 after having run his father's bingo parlors in Maryland. ''They will remake this city in their image. Of course, us old guys aren't done yet. But the new energy is nothing but exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those ''kids'' includes Mr. Maloof, whose family also owns the Sacramento Kings basketball franchise; Frank Fertitta III, 46, and Lorenzo J. Fertitta, 39, who operate <span class="companylink">Station Casinos</span>, which was founded by their father, as well as the burgeoning Ultimate Fighting Championship league.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is James J. Murren, 46, president and chief operating officer of <span class="companylink">MGM Mirage</span>; Sam Nazarian, 32, the Los Angeles hospitality mogul who bought the Sahara Hotel-Resort in 2007; and Anthony A. Marnell III, 33, who is in a joint venture with <span class="companylink">MGM Mirage</span> to build a $1.8 billion resort eight miles south of the Strip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is an investment group that includes the Vegas native and tennis legend Andre Agassi, 38; his agent, Perry Rogers; and Thomas C. Breitling and Timothy N. Poster, who bought and sold the Golden Nugget earlier this decade for a $100 million profit by their 36th birthdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, it seems, something about the gambling business that has always drawn youthful leaders. J. Terrence Lanni, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">MGM Mirage</span>, became chief financial officer of <span class="companylink">Caesars World</span>, which owned Caesars Palace at the time, at 29. Gary W. Loveman became chief operating officer of <span class="companylink">Harrah's Entertainment</span> at 38. As far back as 1946, Bugsy Siegel was just 40 when he built the Flamingo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's nothing like bringing in young blood,'' said Anthony Curtis, publisher of the Las Vegas Advisor newsletter. ''Vegas has to reinvent itself again and again, and it has to appeal to new markets. The old-timers aren't going to really see the changes that are necessary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each case, Mr. Curtis said, important innovations were made in the face of legions of doubters who were proved wrong. Mr. Maloof, for one, emphasized the nightclub and celebrity scene at the Palms, most notably making his mark by allowing his new resort to be the setting for the 2002 season of MTV's ''Real World.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Mr. Breitling, now 38, and Mr. Poster, now 39, followed suit by allowing their lives as owners of the Golden Nugget to be fodder for a reality show on Fox produced by Mark Burnett. Both moves introduced Las Vegas in a new, glamorous way to customers of their generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fertitta brothers, who last year made Forbes magazine's billionaire list with net worths of $1.3 billion each, got there by expanding their father's inkling about the potential for catering to the residents of Las Vegas into a $9 billion, 16-casino enterprise that went private in 2007 in a partnership with Colony Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Station Casinos</span> is poised to expand by virtue of a 110-acre site, named Viva, just west of the Strip where the brothers plan four casino-related developments. The company also has 80 acres sprawling south from their father's original property, Palace Station, but no plans have yet been devised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The starting point for many of these men is their family's fortunes and Las Vegas history. Mr. Maloof's father was a basketball team owner and beer distributor from Albuquerque who served Las Vegas resorts. Mr. Marnell's father is the city's premier general contractor and architect who built the Bellagio and the Wynn and who developed the Rio All-Suites Hotel-Casino. Mr. Rogers's father is the owner of the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas and six other TV stations; Mr. Poster's uncle was a top sportsbook oddsmaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That history gives rise to a personal and professional collegiality unusual among industry rivals. The Fertitta brothers, for instance, own a 6.7 percent stake in Mr. Maloof's resort. Mr. Murren recommended the sale of the Golden Nugget to Mr. Breitling's group and approved the joint venture with Mr. Marnell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, as Mr. Breitling describes in his new memoir, ''Double or Nothing,'' Mr. Rogers, 39, Mr. Poster and Lorenzo Fertitta became friends at the same Las Vegas parochial high school, and Mr. Fertitta befriended Mr. Breitling at the University of Southern California, which led to the Fertittas, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Agassi helping to finance the Golden Nugget purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is enough for Mr. Murren, one of the few nonnative young moguls, to remark: ''There's certainly more nepotism and more incestuous behavior in the gaming industry than I've seen in other industries.'' But, he was quick to add, ''these guys have taken opportunities that many people squander, and have done more with them than most anyone I know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murren is clearly of a different breed. Often cited as heir apparent to the 65-year-old Mr. Lanni, Mr. Murren was 36 in 1998 when he became chief financial officer of what was MGM Grand at the time. He takes credit for negotiating buyouts of <span class="companylink">Mirage Resorts</span> in 2000 and <span class="companylink">Mandalay Resort Group</span> in 2004. And he also came up with the plan to use 76 acres on the Strip for the CityCenter, an $8 billion development of six high-rises that is the nation's most expensive privately financed construction project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The other guys are cut from a different cloth than I am,'' said Mr. Murren, who was raised in Connecticut and earned an art history degree before veering into the investment world after an internship with a bank in Hartford. ''I'm the least knowledgeable person you'll talk to as it relates to gambling. I don't do it. I get up at 4:30 a.m. I'm asleep by 10 p.m. I've never been to the nightclubs. I don't go barhopping. I don't live that business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He may not need to, given his company's broad-based clientele, but Mr. Nazarian said that his generation's advantage is largely in knowing what the 40-and-younger crowd wants from Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn, Mr. Adelson and Mr. Lanni are building top-end resorts for wealthy, older people like themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you ask me what is the best toy for a 10-year-old, I cannot tell you, but if you ask a 10-year-old, he'll tell you very well,'' said Mr. Nazarian, the chief executive of the SBE Entertainment Group, which bought the Sahara, the former haunt of the Rat Pack, for a reported $400 million in March 2007. He plans to reinvigorate it by having Philippe Starck redesign it and by adding outposts of the California restaurant and nightclub brands he owns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lavish new projects near the Sahara will ''price a lot of people out of the market by 2011 or 2012,'' he said. ''I want to offer an affordable hotel with rates between $150 and $250 that's unbelievably chic and unbelievably creative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is clearly a rivalry between the young and old guards, Mr. Breitling is surprised by how paternal the elders are. Mr. Wynn, who once owned the Golden Nugget, dined with Mr. Breitling and Mr. Poster after they bought the place and regaled them with old Vegas tales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's this interesting camaraderie in this industry,'' said Mr. Breitling, who along with Mr. Poster, Mr. Agassi and Mr. Rogers is on the hunt for another shot at the Las Vegas game. ''When we ran into these people after we sold the Golden Nugget, they give us the congratulations and say, 'We hope you guys stay in the business.' ''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHILE the slow economy has left many small businesses scraping to get by, some enterprises are finding opportunity in the carnage. They include an entire industry devoted to distressed companies. When things are booming, this sector is like the lonely Maytag repairman, who doesn't have much work to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other businesses are not as clearly countercyclical, but they offer products or services that are increasingly in demand. And those that are really nimble can capitalize on the sudden needs of consumers or fellow businesses.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are stories of five small businesses that are thriving in hard times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STANDING UP FOR WORKERS Outten &amp; Golden, a New York law firm that exclusively represents employees, will add three lawyers to its staff of 28 professionals this year to accommodate business attributable to the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to the increase is what Wayne Outten, a founding partner, calls transactional work -- helping employees who are moving into and out of jobs to negotiate with their employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who have been laid off, there may be opportunities to enhance severance packages -- for instance, perhaps their employers could be persuaded to keep them on the payroll long enough to qualify for retirement, medical or stock benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees also seek legal help when they voluntarily change jobs, rather than being forced to leave. Not only should they get job details in writing from their new employers, but they must also comply with commitments to the old ones. Potential considerations include agreements with former employers not to compete with their former companies, solicit their customers, clients or vendors or take other staff members with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Outten said that mass layoffs accounted for a drastic increase in another part of the firm's practice -- that is, lawsuits under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, a federal law that requires companies to give employees at least 60 days' notice of a plant's closing or reduction in force. The firm is pursuing about a dozen cases against businesses that have not complied with the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRACKING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The early stages of a downturn benefit Ontario Systems, which has its headquarters in Muncie, Ind., said Wil Davis, president and co-founder. That is when consumers start to get behind on their bills and businesses seek help with the laborious and time-consuming task of tracking and pursuing their accounts receivable. Among other things, Ontario, a 450-employee company, provides software and technical support for managing extended-payment plans and segmenting accounts when multiple parties share an expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hospitals are a growing market for Ontario's products, especially because consumers are shouldering a bigger portion of their own health care costs. Job losses and rising prices for everyday necessities make medical bills a low priority for some patients, and hospitals must try harder to collect. In that niche alone, Ontario had a 30 percent increase in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, Mr. Davis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he estimated from past experience that in another six months Ontario Systems itself would start to feel the negative effects of a recession because, ultimately, creditors realize that chasing people who do not have the resources to pay them is futile, Mr. Davis said. Once that happens, creditors will not spend much money on bill-collecting systems until the economy picks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HELPING COMMERCIAL BORROWERS When Ann Hambly started 1st Service Solutions in Grapevine, Tex., in January 2006, she planned to help buyers of commercial real estate -- multifamily apartments, office buildings and shopping centers -- who wanted to take over the sellers' mortgages, rather than get new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little did she realize her good timing. With the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit tightening during the last nine months, buyers may now have no other financing choice than to assume or take over the sellers' mortgages. Increasingly, borrowers also seek her aid in modifying loan terms (for example, decreasing the principal payments and extending the maturity date) to cope with setbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hambly, who started the business on her own, has expanded her staff to eight and added a partner two months ago. Profits at 1st Service rose to $1 million in 2007 from $250,000 in 2006, its first year of operation. ''I would like to think we would have had a thriving business either way,'' Ms. Hambly said. ''But I definitely had a big gust of wind go in the sail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIQUIDATING MACHINERY AND INVENTORY Paul Lerman, chief executive of Atec in St. Louis, did not need the economic pundits to tell him that a recession was coming. He saw signs at the end of 2006, when he began getting calls from banks who were dealing with troubled companies. Some wanted to liquidate business property that had been acquired through foreclosures. Others wanted to monitor the declining asset values of companies that had pledged their inventories and accounts receivable as security for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been through other recessions since he started Atec in 1983, Mr. Lerman expected a corresponding dip in the demand for another service that his company offers: making preloan appraisals of the same assets for banks. Still, the countercyclical part of Atec's business has more than compensated for that decline, enough so that profits for the first quarter are up by more than two digits over the same period last year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, Atec benefits from the ripple effect of a slowdown. For example, it liquidated trucking companies hurt by rising fuel costs and a contractor that cleaned new homes after construction (a casualty of the drop in housing starts). Atec, which has 19 employees, including three full-time auctioneers who travel the country, gets a 12 percent commission for selling off business assets. Even in a soft market, there is always a buyer, Mr. Lerman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVISING TROUBLED COMPANIES Boom times at Gordian Group, New York-based restructuring advisers, are directly countercyclical to the American economy. After a three-year lull, business picked up in January, with larger, more complex assignments from troubled companies, said Henry F. Owsley, a partner at the 20-year-old firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordian's clients arrive in various degrees of financial distress, both before and after bankruptcy, he said. They may be having liquidity problems, with expenses outpacing revenues; they may be exhausting credit at financial institutions; or their creditors, who may have once been lenient in a tight cycle, may now be demanding payment. Since Gordian's business model combines monthly payments with a success fee for finding a buyer or getting a loan, the 20-employee firm has yet to realize its biggest potential revenue from the current downturn, Mr. Owsley said. Meanwhile, it continues to nurture two auxiliary businesses started during its slack periods. One involves serving as expert witnesses in, for example, bankruptcy-related lawsuits. The other, started last year, is Bacchus Capital Management, which makes loans to wineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a small-business owner who has worked with troubled companies, Mr. Owsley can offer a survival tip to other companies. For those whose work is not countercyclical, the greatest pain may be ahead, he said, adding, ''Maintaining liquidity is probably the most important thing you can do.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SMALL-BUSINESS owners often juggle tasks from accounting to finding customers to keeping existing ones happy. But the one task many busy managers avoid is taking care of computers, networks and other technology. Installing software, setting up broadband connections and backing up servers can be time-consuming and complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet because many small companies often do not have specialists in information technology on staff, when critical technology fails business can grind to a halt.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to keep up to date on security, business continuity and compliance with credit-card rules,'' said Rick Ruiz, who runs I.B.M.'s global technology services group. ''A large company can weather a computer glitch, but a smaller company can be put in a bad situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why some I.T. specialists are expanding their operations to help small companies with limited resources. Big players like I.B.M. are providing off-site servers and keeping them safe from viruses and other threats. Technology providers, including Geek Squad, which is affiliated with <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>, are moving beyond helping consumers to focus more on small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, when Tamika Tatum, general manager of Yardley's Salon &amp; Spa in San Antonio, helped open the 10,000-square-foot salon five months ago, she hired Geek Squad to install the three computers and software she had bought at <span class="companylink">Best Buy.</span> Several months later, she called Geek Squad again to connect those three computers to three others that she had purchased for the back office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Management is just me and the owners, just when they can get free,'' Ms. Tatum said. ''I don't have time to be an I.T. person.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geek Squad charges the same for business and residential services -- setting up a basic two-computer network, for example, costs $159 -- but the company expects small-business owners to call more often for help, so that should increase sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're much less likely to let a minor problem persist,'' said Jeffrey Severts, a vice president of <span class="companylink">Best Buy.</span> ''If their technology is failing, they're losing money and will move as quickly as possible to move to back it up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Severts and executives at other retailers that provide office supplies are expecting the number of small businesses to grow as more boomers retire and start the kind of companies that begin in living rooms or garages with off-the-shelf equipment and cheap broadband lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge for Geek Squad and other technology providers affiliated with retailers, like <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span>'s Firedog, is to figure out which customers are buying goods for personal use and which will use them in their offices, whether at home or elsewhere. The line, it seems, is often blurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, Geek Squad sales agents, who have concentrated almost exclusively on consumers, started asking customers in <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> stores whether the laptop computers or wireless routers they were buying were for home or business use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Wright, a collision repair consultant who works from her home in Willoughby Hills, Ohio, had Geek Squad set up her computer and digital camera and the wireless Internet connection in her home office, as well as the <span class="companylink">Sony</span> video recorder her husband uses. When it came time to upgrade her computers, printers and monitors, she spent about $2,800 at <span class="companylink">Best Buy.</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can call them for help, but you don't have to have them on a full-time basis,'' Ms. Wright said of Geek Squad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small companies are also relying on I.T. specialists, sometimes several time zones away, who provide remote support, like monitoring the security of servers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Dion, the owner of Press Any Key, a technology provider in Brookfield, Conn., is the de facto I.T. staff for the Warm Company, a quilt maker of 50 employees with an office in Lynnwood, Wash., and warehouses in North Carolina, Washington and Vermont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the East Coast, Mr. Dion keeps track of the workstations at these locations and makes sure that the bar-code system is working and the company's data is properly stored. When something goes wrong, he and Erica Johnson, the assistant vice president of Warm Company's operations in Lynnwood, discuss the problem, sometimes using Webcams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By having Mr. Dion handle the company's technology remotely, Ms. Johnson has been able to cut costs. In 2007, it spent 0.53 percent of its revenue on technology, down from 0.97 percent two years earlier in 2005, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have ideas, but we don't know how to implement them,'' said Ms. Johnson, who is working with Mr. Dion to digitize more office functions to save paper. ''We don't have time to learn it all.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 7 a.m., when Mark Roesner arrives at Copley Feed and Supply in Ohio and turns on the lights, until a little after 6 p.m., when his wife, Nancy Roesner, turns them off, the Roesners are reminded of the costs of inflation in ways big and small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electricity for the lights at the 3,200-square-foot store costs more than it did a year ago. So does the fuel for deliveries. Mr. Roesner says he has been spending more of his time lately trying to figure out the most efficient delivery routes. Then, there are the ever-rising costs for horse and bird feed, shelled corn and fertilizer. Nancy Roesner says she has been scouring the invoices each day, and then figuring out how much to raise prices to keep her profit margins.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see an end in sight,'' she said, not with prices so high -- and heading higher -- on fertilizer and seed. ''I don't see how prices can go down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has sunk its teeth into small businesses this year. The number of owners citing inflation as their No. 1 concern on the National Federation of Independent Businesses monthly economic index in April was at its highest level since 1982. One in five owners is raising prices, according to William C. Dunkelberg, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's happening is every time people open the back door to receive supplies, prices are higher,'' Mr. Dunkelberg said. ''Right now they are trying to pass it on to their customers.'' In April, 35 percent of owners said they raised prices, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Roesners say they have had no choice but to adjust. In one year, Mrs. Roesner said, the price of a 50-pound bag of fertilizer more than doubled to $19.99, from $7.89; a bale of hay rose to $6.29, from $4.29, and a 50-pound bag of horse feed to $10.49, from $6.99.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, the government is indicating that inflation is in check, taking into account seasonal variations. On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices climbed just 0.2 percent in April. The core rate, though, which excludes food and energy, had its largest year-over-year jump since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, the government reported that consumer prices inched up in April, suggesting cooling inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Main Street and in households across America -- where rapidly rising fuel and food prices are not excluded -- the picture is not so rosy. Gasoline prices are now up to about $3.80 a gallon. The cost of diesel fuel, which powers many small business vehicles, set a record yet again on Wednesday, about $4.56 a gallon, up nearly 64 percent from a year ago. And food prices rose at a 0.9 percent rate in April, the biggest one-month jump since 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Federal Reserve in its minutes says it is counting on the recession to manage inflation,'' Mr. Dunkelberg wrote in his summary. ''If we are in a recession, it is not getting the job done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, including Mr. Dunkelberg and Raymond Keating of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, have tracked an increase in prices over the last couple of years, though Mr. Keating said it was ''not the raging inflation we had in the 1970s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, not every business is passing along the pain, Mr. Keating said, but certainly more owners are trying to do it this year if the competition allows it. That trend has been reflected in the monthly surveys of the National Federation of Independent Businesses this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zachary Hoffman, an owner of Wiley Office Furniture in Springfield, Ill., said he, too, had been passing ''more and more manufacturers' price increases on to our customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers, especially those shipping steel components like shelves, desks and files, used to raise prices in line with the consumer price index, Mr. Hoffman said. Now it is twice that rate, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the cost of goods, Wiley Office Furniture is grappling with significant operating expenses. ''Our fuel bill has more than doubled in the space of a year,'' he said. The company's delivery trucks run on diesel and only get about seven miles to the gallon, and the cost to service those vehicles has also gone up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's utility bill has skyrocketed, so much that Wiley replaced all of its lights in its showroom with more efficient fluorescent lights, Mr. Hoffman said, which are turned down to save energy. And it is now aggressively recycling all cardboard boxes to save on waste removal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year for the first time, he said, the company had to ask its 30 full-time employees to pay a share of their health insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More customers are coming in to pick up furniture, he said, because the company had had to raise its delivery charges. Even so, on long hauls, delivery is a losing proposition for Wiley. Now it is grouping those long-distance deliveries by ZIP code to become more efficient. That takes longer, but customers are willing to wait to pay less, Mr. Hoffman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copley Feed, too, is altering deliveries, scaling back to twice a week from three times. It will deliver only once a week if necessary, Mrs. Roesner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, neither Wiley nor Copley has had to consider layoffs, but that could change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have always been very frugal,'' Mrs. Roesner said. ''We are making sure that lights are off in areas we are not in. Sometimes the guys tend to leave a room and leave the lights on, so we women get on them about it. If we are slow then I put it up to the employees to pick who wants off early.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Roesner said she was not sure if she would have to resort to layoffs if the price of gasoline climbed to $5 a gallon. Her customers, she suspects, will be cutting back on owning pets since that can be seen as more of a luxury than a necessity. Lawn and garden customers might forgo splurging this season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, some pleasure-horse owners are putting their horses out to pasture, which means those customers are not buying her feed. ''We've seen a recession before,'' Mrs. Roesner said, recalling her nearly 40 years in the business, ''but not to this extent.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Books aimed at the small business and entrepreneur audience far too often fall into two categories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is the ''how I made $27 trillion in business, and you can too,'' genre or the ones that say you only need to take care of customers (or cash flow or sales or something else) and you will be the envy of Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The following four do not fit into either mold, and if, for no other reason, are worthy of consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's start with the best, and work our way through the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A Whack on the Side of the Head'' (Business Plus), a book about increasing creativity, has just been reissued to celebrate its 25th anniversary and it easy to understand its lasting appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author, Roger von Oech, a consultant, has taken an abstract subject -- how to think differently -- and made it concrete by asking a series of questions, all of which involve breaking what he calls the ''mental locks'' that bind our thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of us have certain attitudes that lock our thinking into the status quo and keep us thinking 'more of the same,' '' he writes. ''These attitudes are necessary for most of what we do, but they get in the way when we are trying to be creative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He suggests breaking the locks by acknowledging that they are there and forcing yourself to pry them open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are typically taught, for example, that there is one right answer to a problem. But, he says, keep searching even after you find it. After all, as Linus Paul, winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry and the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize, put it, ''The best way to get a good idea is to get a lot of ideas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps one of the most appealing things about ''How to Get Rich'' (<span class="companylink">Ebury Press</span>, 2006), is that the author, Felix Dennis -- the publisher of Maxim, The Week and Stuff magazines, spends a lot of time discussing the mistakes he made. He didn't understand that people who buy computer gaming magazines wanted a free game with each copy, as one of his rivals was offering. And he laments not diversifying into television and exploiting the internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That candor gives him credibility when he offers several warnings to entrepreneurs:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never be overoptimistic when it comes to day-to-day finances. ''If cash flow is good, then no matter how badly run or poorly managed a company is, there is always a decent chance of turning it around,'' he says. ''But if a business's cash flow is weak or failing, then the chances are it must shut down or be sold in the not-too distant future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never act big. You, and your company, should live below your means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never skimp on hiring talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are only four traditional business ideas in ''The One Minute Entrepreneur'' (Doubleday, 2008), the latest in the ''One Minute'' series by Ken Blanchard, this time assisted by Don Hutson and Ethan Willis. Here they are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Revenue needs to exceed expenses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2.Collect your bills. Don't let your customers use you to increase their cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Take care of your customers. ''You work for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Take care of your people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the appeal of the fable is not in the business advice, it is the relentlessly upbeat, encouraging message that if you work hard enough, and concentrate on the right things, you will be successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all fairy tales that have a happy ending, it would be nice to believe the message is true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise underlying ''Life Entrepreneurs'' (Jossey Bass, 2008), by the consultants Christopher Gergen and Gregg Vanourek, is simple. The same principles that can make you a success in starting your own business -- recognizing opportunities, taking risks and innovation -- can lead to a more fulfilling life as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They argue that you can obtain the life you want by following exactly the approach you did in starting your business: You develop a plan, in this case for what a good life would look like, and you figure out how to obtain it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sounds simple in the abstract. But then, again, so does starting a successful business. Hard work is required in both cases.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To all the usual reasons that small businesses are put up for sale -- personal problems and personnel squabbles among them -- add economic woes this year. But even as for-sale listings rise around the country, so is buyer interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When economic times get tough and people can't find a job, they will go out and buy a job,'' said Ronald W. Hottes, president of the Business Team, a broker in Torrance, Calif.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, though, for owners seeking to sell their businesses is that prices appear to be softening -- a reflection of a variety of causes, among them tighter credit markets, rising costs and fewer customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's largest listing site, bizbuysell.com, has 50,000 businesses for sale -- up from 43,000 this time last year, said Michael K. Handelsman, the site's general manager. The number of businesses being sold also rose, to 1,795 listings that closed in the first quarter of this year, a 66 percent increase from 1,081 sales in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Gaithersburg, Md., mill3nnium.com reported that businesses for sale on its site had surged in the last year. The site focuses on the metropolitan Washington area, and one reason for the surge was a decline in customers. Those businesses included delis, dry cleaners, dollar stores and gas stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have 80 to 100 listings, double the number we had last year,'' said the site's owner, Moses A. Zuniga. ''Every business is hurting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sites can give only a snapshot of the market, Mr. Handelsman acknowledged, because ''when a listing is removed, we always check to see if it sold, but the broker doesn't always tell us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers say that buyers typically are people who are retiring and looking for a second act or laid-off corporate executives looking for a business to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retirement, illness, divorce, death -- and simple burnout -- still drive the majority of owners to sell, but in the rocky economy, some otherwise solid businesses are now having a hard time. Their owners decide they cannot hold out for better times, so they sell for less, business brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decline in revenue was one reason that Richard Lightowler decided to sell the family's retail nursery in West Linn., Ore., in January. When he took over the Willamette General Store from his parents in early 2007, he said, he evaluated the business. He said he found it difficult to manage the adjacent nursery, which specializes in ponds and pond supplies, as well as the store's growing business in expensive Traeger barbecue grills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he decided to sell the decade-old nursery, which had been bringing in $150,000 annually several years ago. Business had slipped even though nurseries generate higher margins than the hardware, barbecue supplies and food that are the core items at the blue-and-white clapboard general store, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A few years ago -- based on how it was doing then -- I could have gotten $50,000 for the nursery,'' said Mr. Lightowler, 40. ''But I had to ask less, about $40,000, and accept $33,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phillip L. Beukema, of Luxemburg, Wis., who recently sold his online business, Corporate Apparel Unlimited, may have been luckier in his timing. Over the last eight years, he and his family built the company, which sells promotional items like T-shirts on 13 Web sites, with some 25,000 clients, and recorded $2.8 million in sales in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he and his wife, Charla, both 55 years old, decided last August that they wanted to retire. So last fall he listed the company with a business broker, Cornerstone Business Services, in nearby Green Bay, and the transaction -- he did not disclose the sales price -- closed on Feb. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price, said Mr. Beukema, a former college dean, would probably have been less if he had tried to sell this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the subprime situation hit last year, we noticed about a 10 percent slide in orders,'' he said. ''So if we had put it on the market in January, the asking price would have been in jeopardy. I don't think we could have gotten the same figure for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinpointing what is happening to sales prices nationwide is difficult because data is diffuse and unreliable. It is possible to advertise nationally on a Web site, but the buying and selling of most small businesses remains local. And most transfers of small businesses are between individuals, who are not required to register such transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both listing sites and brokers around the country say that sellers have become more flexible about price. In a survey by the International Business Brokers Association of its 2,000 members, nearly 73 percent predicted that 2008 would be a buyer's market. The survey was released in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cress S. Diglio Sr., the association's chairman and president of Corporate Investment International, which is based in Orlando, Fla., said that ''this year the number of sellers will easily outpace the number of qualified buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is that a crucial small business financing tool, home equity lines of credit, has been drying up as house values fall. Traditionally, small businesses have had a hard time obtaining commercial credit, and that is worsened in rough economic times, several brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A year ago, people were using home equity loans,'' Mr. Hottes said. ''And now they are drawing down their 401(k)s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers -- who historically have provided financing to sell their small businesses -- are doing so more than ever, said Julie Gordon White, chief executive officer of BlueKey Business Brokerage in Point Richmond, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, an unpleasant truth is that many, if not most, businesses do not sell. For decades, the conventional wisdom was that brokers sold about one out of five businesses they listed. But a new study by Louis O. Vescio, owner of Sunbelt Business Brokers in Melbourne, Fla., found that the percentage was only 10.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main reason, Mr. Vescio and others said, was that ''most small business owners keep bad records,'' so buyers cannot get an accurate financial picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidentiality can also hamper sales, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not like a house where you want everyone to know it's for sale,'' said Mr. Diglio, who has been in the business for two decades. ''You don't want employees, customers or competitors to know you are selling.''</p>

Sales of tea have increased every year for more than 15 years and show no signs of slowing. R. C. Bigelow, a family-owned company in Fairfield, Conn., is one of the country's biggest tea producers. Cindi Bigelow is the third generation of the family to take the reins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She recently talked about Bigelow's alliance with another big name in the industry, the company's foray into new media and its international thrust.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How is Bigelow doing in this economy? If coffee drinkers cut back on <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> when money is tight, do tea drinkers cut back on specialty tea as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The specialty tea category is only doing O.K., but we're doing extremely well. We're up at least 5 percent for the year ending June 30, and I don't take that lightly. We're not affected like <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> because people have to drive to <span class="companylink">Starbucks.</span> You don't need to make a special trip to buy our product. Bigelow Tea is still a premium brand that you can buy in a grocery store for about $3 a box. That's about 13 cents for a luxury cup of tea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've always prided ourselves on the fact that we don't spend a lot of money on advertising. We put it all into the tea and the packaging so that we protect the tea. So we're still reasonably priced for a specialty tea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Many companies are flocking to new media for advertising. Are you following their lead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are. That's a fun thing about a company our size -- we had more than $110 million in revenue in 2007 -- and the fact that we're family-owned. We don't have a lot of red tape. We've been involved in blogging and social networking and online videos for a couple of years, and we're having a ball. I'm young, 47, and it's fun for me to do videos so that people can put a face and personality to Bigelow Tea. There are not a lot of family-owned companies that are national. It's great that we have this opportunity to let the consumer get to know us, and it's another way we can get to know them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've always called consumers personally if they had a problem. So using the new media is an extension of a philosophy we already knew -- take care of your customers, talk to them. I create videos for YouTube and young people respond with their own. I watch a few every week and laugh. It's so great to see a 23-year-old from the middle of the country holding up her box of Bigelow Tea. How great is it to be able to see all kinds of people, with their own styles, wanting to talk about Bigelow Tea on the Internet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Two years ago you teamed up with Arizona Beverage Company. How is that working?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We have a wonderful alliance. We make their tea bags and distribute and market them, and they make our ready-to-drink beverages. From October to the end of April, Bigelow sold over 10 million cups of Arizona tea. They make ready-to-drink vanilla chai and mocha chai for us and distribute them on the East Coast. They are working with us on some other projects as well that have not yet been announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're also a family company and like to have fun like we do. They're quality-minded and have a great business model. There's never a time I meet with them that I don't walk out saying, ''Holy cow.'' Some people congratulated me on buying Arizona. Buy Arizona? Not so. It's a billion-dollar company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.If you don't have to worry about shareholders, what are the pressures on a family-owned business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I can't even imagine the pressures on a publicly owned company. One of our competitors, with whom we have a good relationship, is the publicly owned <span class="companylink">Celestial Seasonings.</span> Celestial has the pressure of financial reports, closing statements and the like. We don't have that. The pressure I feel is to be successful for the families of our 330 employees. And, of course, we have to take care of the consumer. You have to do due diligence on consumer safety day in and day out so you don't have any problems in that area. You don't worry about safety after you have a problem, you worry about it when you have none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Researchers occasionally reverse themselves on the health benefits of certain foods. Do the health benefits of your product still hold true?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I've been lecturing on the benefits of tea for 15 years, and the research has been consistent. It's not a new phenomenon. What you have to realize is that you're drinking the brew of a vegetable, and it's loaded with antioxidants. It doesn't matter if it's green or black. In March, a study reported that drinking tea while taking antibiotics boosted or enhanced the benefit of the antibiotic and is helpful in fighting bacteria that is not normally receptive to antibiotics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Have you not directed your efforts toward the international market over the years because of the difficulty of competing with countries that produce tea, like China, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Turkey?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Years ago we did not place much emphasis in this area, but we changed that about three years ago. Today it is a business that is bringing us much growth. In the last few years, that segment of our company has grown in triple digits.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expertise can be more important than cash when it comes to winning investments in China, managers of four of the world's biggest buyout firms said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Just bringing capital to China is not sufficient, with China itself having more than $1 trillion in reserves,'' Daniel A. Carroll, managing partner of TPG's operations in Asia, said at the Boao Forum for Asia, a nonprofit event modeled after the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ''It's about offering expertise, which is about management.''</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to get a share of the fast-growing Chinese economy, private equity firms are adapting to meet demands by Chinese companies that go beyond financing. They include management skills, help in solving regulatory problems in cross-border takeovers and access to a network that allows them to expand abroad. As a result, buyout firms, which usually aim for a controlling stake in a company, are seeking smaller stakes and investments in state-owned companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carroll's comments were echoed by managers at the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, who shared a panel. The conference was held for the first time in London as the city competes for clout in the Chinese market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''China is going to be a very, very important market for us long term,'' said Johannes P. Huth, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Kohlberg Kravis.</span> ''The macroeconomic environment is very favorable, and the entrepreneurial culture attracts us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global private equity firms have poured into China looking for ways to benefit from rapid economic growth, especially as growth in developed economies is slowing. Yet, competition for talent and investments is fierce and investment plans are limited by tight regulations that restrict the stakes of foreign firms in certain industries, including natural resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gerry Murphy, senior managing director at <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> in London, said investments in China generally involved more equity and less borrowed money, and were smaller than in developed markets. But private equity firms will want to exert the same influence over management decisions as elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew E. Wolff, a partner and managing director at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, said investments could range from backing private entrepreneurs to helping state-owned companies to reorganize ahead of an initial public offering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private equity investors also could advise companies on possible takeover targets abroad. Natural resources and renewable energy are two particularly hot areas the company is eager to invest in, Mr. Wolff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carroll agreed but added that a 25 percent limit on foreign ownership in natural resources firms meant that TPG had focused more on investments in companies one step removed from the sector, like mining services firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of the intensity of the competition among private equity firms for investments in these industries came when a Chinese businessman in the audience asked how his company could attract such funds. Almost all the private equity managers said they wanted to discuss a possible investment in his company.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT has not been an easy six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This column profiled three new small businesses at the end of last year and the start of this year -- Sweet Bites Bakery and Cafe in West Acton, Mass., started by Caitlin Adler; Tina Ericson's Mamaisms Gear, in Wilmington, N.C.; and Jeff Takle's RentingYourHome.com in Somerville, Mass. -- with the promise to report on their progress after six months and again after one year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None met all their goals, but Ms. Adler came the closest. She has built her cafe to $8,000 in revenue a week, up from $7,000 six months ago. But that is still $3,000 shy of her projections. She also expects to begin making a profit this summer, an impressive achievement for a new restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ericson, by contrast, has scaled back her ambitions to create a Web clothing store that doubles as a portal to an Internet center for women. She instead has spent most of her time making cold calls to boutique shops to sell her ''Mama says'' T-shirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Takle, just back from a trip to India to recruit low-cost legal talent for his property management software company, says that while he remains hopeful, his venture is foundering. ''It's getting dangerously close to needing investors just to survive, which is a bad place to be,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Adler has made improvements, like installing a commercial dishwasher, which saves on labor costs. She expects by August to be able to start paying herself a salary and her parents interest on tens of thousands of dollars in loans. She also said that she might make her father, a senior manager at the <span class="companylink">Boston Consulting Group</span> who spent Mother's Day washing dishes in her kitchen, an equal partner in the venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she has not toned down her ambitions. In July, she plans to reintroduce a line of wholesale gourmet brownies (like her trademarked Triple Chocolate Peanut Butter Orgasmatron) that she suspended last year because they were slow sellers at trade fairs. She is negotiating with a distributor to market them throughout the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While she is just getting her Web site, sweet-bites.com, up and running this week, she views it as a vehicle to sell her brownies and T-shirts and, sometime in the future, other items like coffee mugs with the Sweet Bites logo. She says she is still optimistic that she can increase sales to $11,000 a week by December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, she does limited catering, potentially a big moneymaker, because Sweet Bites does not yet have a walk-in refrigerator. ''It's crazy, I know,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long hours -- she has taken only one day off this year -- and the stress have taken an emotional toll. ''It's been a crash course for me on running a business,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ericson, whose venture sells T-shirts stamped with ''Mama says'' slogans like ''quit whining'' (which she speculates that grateful mothers just point to when their children get on their nerves), says that things are going ''very, very well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not necessarily as expected. When she started Mamaisms Gear (mamaismsgear.com) in December, she said she would be selling her T-shirts, other clothing like Hot Mama pajamas and a line of reusable containers on her Web site while creating an Internet community for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, she has given up everything but the T-shirts. And after discovering the difficulties of selling them on the Internet, she is marketing them to stores. So far, they are in 10 locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ericson also dropped a separate plan to start a consulting firm for the financial sector because of bad chemistry among some of the potential partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been very much a learning process,'' she said. ''The lessons are: Keep it simple, and don't overreach.'' She says she has also learned to keep her political and business interests separate, after realizing that links to left-wing blogs on her site might alienate potential customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she is undaunted. Sales in the first half of this year are approaching $30,000, and she thinks she can make her $100,000 target for 2008 and become profitable by December. Meantime, she has accepted a full-time job with a six-figure salary, working out of her home as vice president for business development of a publishing company in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ms. Ericson, Mr. Takle is trying to look on the bright side of his company's state, while not understating the challenges he faces. Reached in India by e-mail, he gave a frank assessment of RentingYourHome.com, which sells software that helps landlords manage their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd say things have gotten much more difficult in the last six months,'' he wrote. ''While there are a lot of positive developments, some of the fundamentals are in serious jeopardy. I chose to try double duty and run the company while at the same time go back for an M.B.A. to learn more about fund-raising, financials and how to take the company to the next level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He continued: ''Unfortunately, cash waits for no one. Sales have lagged behind projections, and retention of current customers, while improving over last year, isn't where it could be to make the company 'bankable.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said he had reasons for hope. The company recorded a 17 percent growth in revenue in the first half of this year, enough to cover operational expenses. It expanded its reach to 42 states from 35, it negotiated a partnership with a Web design and marketing company, and it found a source of inexpensive, high-quality legal research in India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still on track for building a self-sustaining, profitable company,'' Mr. Takle said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his setbacks have stung. His slowness in raising investment capital scared away a seasoned executive whom he was trying to recruit. Worse, his co-founder left the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what do the experts think? John Foley, the restaurant adviser for AllBusiness.com, gave Ms. Adler the same passing grade he did six months ago -- and sounded the same warning notes. Her plan to sell brownies and open an online store is like starting a second business, with all its attendant headaches, he said. On the other hand, if she threw all her energies into her new wholesale business and used the cafe primarily as a promotional tool for it, ''that might work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever happens, Mr. Foley added, ''she'll have gained a better business education than she could at the Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard Business School combined.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neal Thornberry, an author and associate professor of business management at Babson College in Massachusetts, was dubious about the prospects for Ms. Ericson's T-shirt enterprise. ''She's a typical start-up entrepreneur -- her enthusiasm clouds her judgment,'' he said. ''She's gone from a business to customer product company to a business-to-business distribution company, a huge shift.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicted that she would come to a ''crisis point'' before the end of the year, forcing her to decide whether to continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Janet Portman, a lawyer and an expert in landlord-tenant law at Nolo, a provider of legal information for consumers and small businesses, said her doubts about the viability of Mr. Takle's business model remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His jaunt to India to look for legal assistance is further evidence of his failure to understand the complexities of the legal world he was wading into,'' Ms. Portman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs are used to hearing from skeptics, and like most, Ms. Adler, Ms. Ericson and Mr. Takle all vow to push ahead. Ms. Adler, for one, says she has no choice. ''Being boss isn't always fun,'' she said. ''But I could never work for somebody else.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Steven C. Preston's signature accomplishment as head of the Small Business Administration was overhauling the agency's disaster loan assistance program, a program that was foundering under the crush of Hurricane Katrina claims when he took over nearly two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Preston has now moved on. He started this week as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. While he streamlined the way the S.B.A. worked, he left behind various problems that critics and small-business groups say are particularly troublesome in a weakened economy. They cite the need for greater availability of loans in particular.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And because his departure comes in the waning months of the Bush administration, it is unlikely that a permanent leader for the S.B.A., with a mandate to make major changes, will arrive before next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While they focused on disaster assistance, there has been criticism that the agency has ignored small-business concerns,'' said Karen A. Kerrigan, president and chief executive of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, which represents 70,000 small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's difficulties in getting hurricane assistance to small businesses and homeowners showed how years of cuts by the Bush administration had taken a toll. The S.B.A.'s budget this year, $482 million, was less than half its budget in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say the S.B.A. needs to broaden access to federally guaranteed loans, which carry lower interest rates and lower fees than their commercial counterparts, so that they are more attainable for entrepreneurs and small-enterprise owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minority business owners also complain the agency is not doing enough to help them find financing and contracts. Female entrepreneurs are angry that the S.B.A. has not done more to help deliver a higher percentage of contracts, even though the agency was ordered to do so by Congress eight years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Preston faced no opposition at his confirmation hearing for the job at HUD, Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of New York and head of the House Small Business Committee, gave his stewardship of the S.B.A. an incomplete. ''Unfortunately, he was not at the agency long enough to have a lasting effect,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jovita Carranza, now the acting administrator and a former executive of <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service</span>, is likely to run the agency until a new administration arrives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Mr. Preston's efforts to speed up disaster assistance, Congress recently pushed ahead with provisions, part of the farm bill, that amounted to its own overhaul of the S.B.A. disaster loan program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislation's provisions, said Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, would ''cut through red tape, increase resources, bring private lenders into the response and help bridge that gap while disaster victims begin the process of building their lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, the Senate voted to add $101 million to the agency's budget. The move was also supported by Senator Kerry's Republican counterpart on the committee, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. Both senators argue that the agency needs to step up its efforts since less capital is available elsewhere in the current sluggish economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a contraction in the lending program, which I think is antithetical to what the S.B.A. is supposed to be doing,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''This is a moment where the credit crunch requires the S.B.A. to fill the gap.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number and amount of federal loans under the main loan guarantee program, called 7 (a), has fallen to 50,546 through the end of May this year, from 63,945 loan approvals through the end of May 2007. The loan amounts dropped as a well, to $8.24 billion from almost $9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our overall lending volume is down 8 percent,'' Mr. Preston said in an interview last week. ''And the dollar volume from the riskiest lenders is down 34 percent because they have pulled back the most.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency, he said, has adopted procedures for greater automation, which should streamline lending and make it more attractive for banks to handle S.B.A. loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small-business owners like Frances Richards, who heads Arlean &amp; Company, a construction program management firm in Las Vegas, say they do not see any relief. Her efforts to tap into the area's commercial expansion have been thwarted by difficulties in getting a $25,000 loan to hire the employees necessary to qualify for a subcontract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm in a Catch-22 because I'm not going to get a contract unless I have the capacity to handle it,'' Ms. Richards said. ''But that requires more money than I can get from my credit cards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A. loan program is also contentious because of accusations of inadequate oversight of lending institutions. The agency's inspector general found recently that flawed oversight had resulted in a $329 million loss in recent years. Mr. Kerry and Ms. Snowe this month asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the S.B.A.'s system for monitoring lender portfolios and identifying risky lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole process of overseeing lenders is under review,'' Mr. Preston said. ''We'll be putting clear rules in place to determine what we should do for lenders,'' although he said he would not be around to see it through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most vociferous criticism has been about the S.B.A.'s handling of government contracts, about $400 billion yearly -- 23 percent of that is supposed to be for small businesses. The American Small Business League, which sued and won release of S.B.A. data, maintains that large corporations are receiving contracts meant for small business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the agency changed its rule to require businesses to certify their size every five years to prevent large corporations from winning contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Female business owners are pursuing legal action to force agency compliance with Congress's directive, passed in 2000, that they receive 5 percent of federal contracts. This year, the agency issued a regulation that included only four industries, infuriating female business groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, minority small businesses are even more irate at the S.B.A., though the agency this year started an initiative aimed at helping inner-city enterprises. For minority businesses, ''the S.B.A. isn't even in the picture,'' complained Harry C. Alford, president and chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. ''We are not looking for giveaways, but in contracts and loans we are looking for them to loosen rules and make them more accessible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So right now, we're not counting on the S.B.A.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the number of people without health insurance continues to rise, many states and Congress have begun to focus on one of the biggest causes: the growing number of small business owners and their workers who are unable to afford coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states are taking a variety of approaches. To help ease the burden of insurance premiums that have roughly doubled since 2000, some, like Arizona, are extending tax credits to small employers that provide medical coverage.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, including New Mexico and Montana, are exploring ways to let small businesses band together to amass the purchasing power of big employers. Massachusetts plans to let small businesses benefit from its state-supervised insurance program. And some states, like Colorado, have passed tougher laws governing what insurers can charge small companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''States are being aggressive experimenters, and those lessons learned are going to be invaluable to us in looking at national health reform,'' said Michelle Dimarob, manager of legislative affairs for the National Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress, meanwhile, is considering legislation that, among other steps, would make it significantly easier for small businesses to organize insurance-buying pools. Despite bipartisan backing in both the House and Senate, it is uncertain whether the bills can be passed in this, an election year. But proponents say the legislation would almost certainly be reintroduced next term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because smaller businesses cannot spread the costs and risks of an individual's high medical bills over a large work force the way a big company can, they often must settle for less-generous coverage that leaves workers with substantial out-of-pocket medical expenses. Many small employers simply choose not to provide health benefits, which can cost more than $12,000 a year for a family of four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 47 million uninsured people in this country, at least 20 million are employed by small businesses or work for themselves -- a figure that has increased by an average of more than 500,000 a year since 2000. That is why, even as the presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama are floating ideas for making insurance easier to obtain by individuals, there are also efforts under way to address the needs of small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Half of the uninsured people in our state are working for small business,'' said Nancy Wyman, the state comptroller for Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite broad interest in the issue, though, making significant changes at the state level can be difficult, politically and practically, as Connecticut's recent experience shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the state's Republican governor, M. Jodi Rell, vetoed a measure passed by the Democratic-led legislature that was meant to help small employers by letting them join a state-run insurance-purchasing pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big insurers lobbied heavily against the move, arguing that it would do nothing to stem the rising health costs that are reflected in high premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This debate continues to focus on the premiums rather than health care costs,'' said David R. Fusco, the president of <span class="companylink">Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield</span> in Connecticut, the state's largest insurer for small businesses. ''We have to look at the issue of the underlying cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut Democratic legislators have vowed to try again next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massachusetts, in its widely watched effort to overhaul health insurance, has focused so far on making affordable coverage available to individuals. But later this year the state plans to expand the program to small employers, letting them participate in the state-supervised marketplace set up to give individuals group purchasing power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the percentage of businesses with fewer than 200 employees that offer insurance fell to 59 percent last year, down from 66 percent as recently as 2002, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. And less than half of the smallest companies, those with under 10 employees, were providing coverage last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only does the cost of insurance tend to be a bigger burden for a smaller business, but Jon R. Gabel, a health policy researcher at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, estimates that small firms pay 18 percent more for the same insurance than big companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And employers that do continue to provide health benefits are tending to ask workers to pay more of the overall premiums. So even when small business owners offer coverage, their employees may not be able to afford to sign up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Lista runs the Pond House Cafe in Hartford, where he employs about 50 people, depending on the time of year. Some of his workers are dishwashers, making just $10 or $11 an hour. Although Mr. Lista pays half of the cost of coverage, his employees must nonetheless come up with as much as $150 a month for their share of health insurance. Some choose to go without.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When they're sick, they go to the emergency room,'' Mr. Lista said. One of his waitresses who has chosen not to take insurance, for example, recently ran up $15,000 in medical bills from an emergency room visit. ''She doesn't have the money to pay for it,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, Governor Rell has said that despite her veto she wants to work with legislators to address the concerns of small business. Legislators had sought a way for small businesses to join with the state's 200,000 employees to spread their risks and take advantage of the state's negotiating clout with insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the governor's recent veto, Connecticut had already taken significant steps meant to help small employers provide affordable health coverage. It was among the first, for example, to pass laws intended to limit the large annual jumps in premiums that tend to plague small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Connecticut was one of the first states to do it right,'' said Gary Claxton, who researches health insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even Connecticut has yet to find a way to reduce the potential risk to a small company or insurer if even a single employee develops a serious illness and runs up tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And small businesses in Connecticut and elsewhere still complain of the shock of sharply higher rates when, for example, they replace a 25-year-old man with a 35-year-old woman -- insurers know that women tend to go to the doctor more frequently -- or when a worker celebrates a milestone birthday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Virginia, a florist shop in Culpeper that covers three people had its premiums raised by more than 50 percent last year, after the owner turned 60. The business, which pays the full premium for employees, now spends nearly $1,800 a month on health insurance, up from $1,100, and it elected not to seek a reduction in rates by cutting benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cutting benefits is ''not fair to your employees,'' said Carol Inskeep, the shop's manager. Many small business owners say it is hard to understand how their insurers are pricing the premiums. ''The last few years have been puzzling,'' said Thomas Massingham, a florist in Dover, N.H., who employs three people and pays half of the cost of their coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Massingham has seen premiums go up by about 50 percent in some years, only to fall drastically after New Hampshire in 2006 began forbidding insurers from using the health of a company's employees to set premiums and put stricter limits on rate increases. Even so, this year he was faced with a rate jump of nearly 40 percent, to about $600 an employee a month, to keep the same coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By switching the type of plan and raising everyone's annual maximum out-of-pocket expenses to $2,000, up from $1,500 last year, he limited the premium increase to 15 percent. He and his employees will split the $500 monthly premium per person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State laws now typically make it impossible for businesses to cross state lines to create their own purchasing pools, and small companies have had little success to date in being able to band together in sufficient numbers within state borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the federal legislation would let businesses form such purchasing pools more easily, even across state lines. The legislation would also prevent insurers in any state from basing their premiums on the health status of employees -- a prohibition now on the books in only a minority of states. The legislation would also offer tax credits to businesses that provide coverage insurance to their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate version of the bill, introduced in April and supported by Democrats Dick Durbin of Illinois and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Republicans Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Norm Coleman of Minnesota, would give states the ability to regulate the insurance plans offered through the pools, to prevent them from being abused. A similar House version was introduced this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bipartisan legislation is supported by a number of small business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, as well as consumer groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states, meanwhile, will continue experimenting with their own efforts, according to Richard Cauchi, who follows state health initiatives for the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''There's certainly momentum and growing interest on the state level,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, Ms. Wyman, a Democrat who supported the measure the governor recently vetoed, continues to push for creation of some sort of state-directed purchasing pool. But she recognizes the challenges ahead. ''This is not an easy problem to solve,'' she said. ''We know it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm announcing my plan to provide real relief for small business owners crushed by rising costs, an idea championed by my friend Hillary Clinton, who's been leading the way in our battle to insure every American,'' Mr. Obama told the National Council of La Raza, a Latino group, at their annual conference here.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the mention of Mrs. Clinton's name, the audience of several thousand people cheered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, which would cost $6 billion a year, would provide small businesses a refundable credit of up to 50 percent on premiums for employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Senator John McCain, criticized Mr. Obama's health care proposal as a vague and expensive mandate, which would have ''a devastating impact'' on small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an obvious and crude effort to spackle together a quick political fix, but it lacks specifics, lacks funding and he lacks credibility,'' Mr. Bounds said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCain is scheduled to address the conference on Monday. He and Mr. Obama have been aggressively courting Latino groups, particularly in Florida and a swath of states in the Southwest, where the populations have increased in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Make no mistake about it,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The Latino community holds this election in your hands.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, the run is on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank stocks spun wildly on Tuesday in another bruising day for financial companies. Goaded by bearish analysts, investors seem to be abandoning American banks in droves.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a fraction of the nation's banks are expected to buckle under their growing burden of bad loans, federal regulators, bank executives and analysts agree that the vast majority of institutions are sound. Bank customers are not panicking, particularly since most of their deposits are insured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But shareholders, whose investments are by no means guaranteed, are running scared. It is becoming increasingly clear that even the strongest banks will be grappling with bad loans for years -- and that the outlook for the industry could worsen further if the economy and the housing market continue to weaken. The collapse of <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bancorp</span> last week fanned long-smoldering worries that even healthy banks confront significant challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketplace is passing harsh judgment on an industry that was a darling of Wall Street when home prices and mortgage lending boomed in recent years. The mood darkened further on Tuesday, when the <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corporation</span> was compelled to assert that it was sound as its share price was swept lower for a fifth day. <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> fell nearly 8 percent, leaving it down 76 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-stock <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500 Regional Banks index sank nearly 4 percent, extending its 11 percent decline from Monday. Financial companies like the <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> pulled the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a stark reversal of fortune for the banking industry, and for regional lenders in particular. Many regional banks, big enough to have some heft, but small enough to be managed effectively, rode the mortgage boom to higher profits. Many avoided the alphabet soup of complex debt investments that have cost big banks tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a year ago, many of these banks looked like attractive takeover targets, and investors placed hefty premiums to their share prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now all of that has changed, and the missteps the banks made in good times are glaring. Investors are recoiling from banks that overreached with what turned out to be ill-fated acquisitions. Lenders that need to raise capital are also being shunned, as are those that have made many loans to builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole allure of regional banks has gone out of fashion,'' said David Hendler, a research analyst at Credit Sights in New York. ''They used to have the best perfume in the business. Now, they have an odor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National City Corporation</span> of Cleveland, for example, expanded into Florida just before the bottom fell out of the housing market there. The bank recently raised $7 billion to shore up its finances, and said on Monday that its Tier 1 capital ratio, an important measure of a bank's financial health, ranked among the highest in its class. A bank must have a capital ratio of 6 percent to be considered well-capitalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite such assurances, National City has lost nearly 90 percent of its value in the last year. It sank 4.5 percent on Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other banks that once seemed like attractive takeover targets now look like pariahs. <span class="companylink">SunTrust Banks</span> of Atlanta, which was soaring a year ago on hopes that it might be acquired at a lofty price, has plummeted nearly 70 percent this year, as the prospect of a sale has been mired in losses. A year ago, SunTrust, rumored to be a target of <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, was trading at 1.5 times the value of the assets on its books. Today, it fetches a mere 0.5 times book value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the turmoil in the markets, some banks are struggling to raise capital from investors. So far, most investors who have bought into financial companies in the hope that the worst was over have lost big.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 52 fund-raising efforts tracked by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, investors have come out ahead at only two banks -- Fifth Third of Cincinnati and Western Alliance of Las Vegas -- where they injected money. The average deal was down 45 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are reluctant to sink more money into regional banks, fearing their investments will be diluted if the banks sell even more stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the whiff of bad news can send a stock falling. <span class="companylink">Zions Bancorporation</span>, a Utah-based lender which barreled into construction lending in once-hot markets like Nevada and California, planned to use its in-house brokerage arm to raise $150 million in a series of deals. But when it raised only about $47 million in its first attempt, investors concluded the bank was struggling to raise cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The stock has literally cratered,'' said Richard X. Bove, a prominent banking analyst. ''It has just fallen apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some bright spots on Tuesday. Shares of the <span class="companylink">First Horizon National Corporation</span>, the largest bank in Tennessee, jumped nearly 17 percent after the bank's chief executive offered assurances that the bank has enough capital. The stock is still down 67 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the losses deepen, many investors are asking the same question: Where's the bottom?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chip MacDonald, the banking lawyer at <span class="companylink">Jones Day</span>, said the rapid sell-off and the Treasury Department's actions to shore up the mortgage finance companies might suggest the market is about to turn the corner. ''I think the events of the last week might be a sign,'' he said. Many others see just another false bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: FEAR THAT FAILURES MAY SPREAD: Many banking experts agree that most savings institutions and banks will weather the financial storm. But the seizure of <span class="companylink">IndyMac Bank</span> last week by federal regulators pushed one measure of the problem -- assets at failed banks -- to its highest level since the early 1990s.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the new Wall Street -- it's the center of gravity,'' said Fares Noujaim, <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>'s new president of the company's business in the Middle East and North Africa, pointing up at the main building of the Dubai International Financial Center that covers the sky above him.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called the Gate, it seems more a giant slab of modern art than an office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dubai boom has been riding oil's ascent for years now. Its ultramodern skyline, which barely existed little more than a decade ago, has become a prominent symbol of the emergence of this once scrubby emirate on the western coast of the Persian Gulf as the Middle East's principal financial, trade and tourism center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the deepening bite of the credit crisis spreads from Wall Street and takes a global toll -- torpedoing once-buoyant markets from Shanghai to Stockholm -- the Gate has recently become an even more powerful beacon for a swarm of deal makers looking to stake their claim in one of the world's last remaining bull markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are staggering. Dubai's economic growth is running at roughly 11 percent a year and the government expects it to continue at that pace. Housing prices spiked 42 percent in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though it has little oil of its own, Dubai's welcoming social and investment climate, along with special zones with independent laws, has turned it into a trading entrepot on steroids, beyond Beirut in the 1970s and Hong Kong in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn of an unmanaged boom, as high inflation, a weakening currency and rampant construction stoke fears of a severe reversal to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for Mr. Noujaim, such concerns are for another day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bubble? What bubble?'' Mr. Noujaim asked, pressing his case that the global demand for oil, despite the recent dip in prices, would push its value even higher. ''This will be the next Singapore or Hong Kong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Noujaim is living in a nearby hotel as he struggles to find lodging in Dubai's supercharged real estate market. His new office is just becoming operational.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no matter: his BlackBerry is humming and at a time when the spirits of investment bankers worldwide are at their lowest ebb, he has euphoria to spare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a timeless similarity among investment bankers swept up in a bull market. The sentences come quicker, the workday pushes longer and the eye's gaze becomes all the more intense -- quite simply, the rest of the world's troubles seem far, far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dubai and the oil-fired economies in the region that it services have become just such a vantage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like the best of gold fevers, this buildup is fraught with a competitive edge that reaches straight to the chief executive's suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this decade, multiple trips to China became the de rigueur assignment among Wall Street chief executives panning for rich overseas deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it is the Middle East: John J. Mack of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and Lloyd C. Blankfein of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> have been here several times since the latest boom erupted a few years ago. Richard S. Fuld Jr. of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> has come once and John A. Thain, who took over at Merrill last year, is scheduled to arrive this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> highlights its 42 Dubai-based investment bankers and a flourishing office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has recently moved its co-head of investment banking, Alberto Verme, to the region; <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">UBS</span> are sending bankers over in bundles; and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> has sent a top fixed-income ally of Mr. Blankfein's to plant the firm's flag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And just this week Barclay's wealth management unit, Global Investors, established an office in the financial center here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom may be on, but it is by no means clear that the volume of deals and the opportunities in shallow and heavily regulated capital markets will be enough to sustain these aggressive expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for the corporate executives in the region, hit with a barrage of introductory phone calls, requests for meetings and proffered business cards, the question is this: Will Merrill, Morgan and Goldman be here when the inevitable correction comes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To listen to Georges Makhoul, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s Middle East business, the answer is a resounding yes. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> arrived here in 2005 and became one of the first American banks to establish a presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a full-service commitment,'' said Mr. Makhoul, as he led a visitor through the firm's bustling head office. ''You want to do it right,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chock-full of research analysts, investment bankers and traders, it is by far the largest presence among United States investment banks -- and a cause of skepticism, or perhaps envy, from its competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prove his point, Mr. Makhoul prints outs a sheet of paper, showing <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> as the top underwriter in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have over 150 people in the region,'' he said. ''That is an example of making the right bets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneath Mr. Makhoul's office, a warren of fancy store outlets promise no shortage of treats for flush investment bankers. In one, a well-coiffed banker eyes a Porsche wristwatch and does not bat an eye when a salesman quotes a price of $11,000. Next door, more bankers line up to be fitted for their English bespoke suits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just a march of bankers -- Dubai lures as many as 20,000 new people a month, a number that includes large numbers of workers from the South Asian subcontinent who make the bankers' beds in hotels and drive them around in the cool comfort of their Mercedes (about 90 percent of Dubai's population of 1.4 million is foreign).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We, too, come here for the money,'' said Mosrallah Khan, who works a 12-hour day as a taxi driver to earn enough to send home to his family in Peshawar, Pakistan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When night falls, the deal making continues even as the action shifts from the board room to the many bars and nightclubs located in the city's hotels. Islam is the emirate's religion; accordingly the sale of liquor is largely limited to hotels -- but that is about as far as restrictions go.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Sochos, a sushi bar that overlooks the Arabian Sea, the partying takes on a more relentless aspect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''God, this place is so much fun,'' said a young banker from a major Wall Street house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had one arm draped around a willowy Russian blonde wearing a short skirt and leather boots; in his other hand he juggled a drink and a BlackBerry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was close to 1 a.m. Work beckoned a few hours later and he seemed reluctant to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of the senior bankers sent to Dubai, the work schedule is so relentless that there is little time for such cavorting. Not only are they under pressure to produce fees for their revenue-starved firms, but the fact that Saudi Arabia starts its week on Saturday with the rest of the region following on Sunday means there are in effect no weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a charge they embrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For me, being here is very personal,'' said Wassim Younan, who came here in 2005 after running <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>'s powerful bond and commodities trading unit in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldman is the second-ranked adviser in the region and Mr. Younan makes learning the local etiquette a part of the orientation program for new arrivals to Goldman's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all have big balance sheets,'' he said, ''but it really comes down to the quality of your people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Younan is Christian Lebanese, like his peers at Merrill, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> -- where Makram Azar was recently appointed head of sovereign funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all being in their mid-40s, there is little fraternization among this highly competitive group. They all agree, though, that their familiarity with the region and its language confers an advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives you an edge,'' said Mr. Azar, a top media banker at Lehman who moved to Dubai this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if oil prices stay well above $100 a barrel, there may indeed be enough business for all. The current price of energy means that nearly $2 billion is moving every day from the pockets of consumers around the world to the oil producers in this region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look at all this growth,'' said Mr. Noujaim, as he sat immobile in a traffic jam in Riyadh last month, surrounded by skyscrapers, some recently completed, others still under construction. ''This could be America 100 years ago.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Smart, an Accenture executive, was skeptical the first time she stepped into her firm's new videoconferencing room in Chicago for a meeting with a group of colleagues in London. But the videoconferencing technology, known as telepresence, delivered an experience so lifelike, Ms. Smart recalled, that ''10 minutes into it, you forget you are not in the room with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accenture, a technology consulting firm, has installed 13 of the videoconferencing rooms at its offices around the world and plans to have an additional 22 operating before the end of the year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accenture figures its consultants used virtual meetings to avoid 240 international trips and 120 domestic flights in May alone, for an annual saving of millions of dollars and countless hours of wearying travel for its workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As travel costs rise and airlines cut service, companies large and small are rethinking the face-to-face meeting -- and business travel as well. At the same time, the technology has matured to the point where it is often practical, affordable and more productive to move digital bits instead of bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emerging trend, analysts say, goes well beyond a reaction to rising travel costs and a weakening economy. ''These technology tools are going to change the way corporations think about travel and work in the long run,'' an analyst at <span class="companylink">Forrester Research</span>, Claire Schooley, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Past predictions that technology could replace travel have been frequent and premature. The main difference today, analysts say, is that the technology is finally catching up to its promise. No single breakthrough explains the progress, but rather a series of step-by-step advances -- and steady investment -- in telecommunications networks, software and computer processing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results can be seen not only in the expensive new telepresence systems like those from Cisco Systems or <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, but also in more mainstream collaboration technologies -- Web conferencing, online document sharing, wikis and Internet telephony. The audio and desktop presentations in Web-based meetings, for example, are now more likely to be in sync and interactive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies of all sizes are beginning to shift to Web-based meetings for training and sales presentations. ''Only in the last two years has the technology gotten to point where it really makes sense to use it,'' said Alan Minton, vice president for marketing at Cornerstone Information Systems, a 60-person business software company in Bloomington, Ind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his sales force doing many product demonstrations online, Mr. Minton estimates the group's travel costs of have been cut by 60 percent and the average time to close a new sale has been reduced by 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one suggests that the face-to-face meeting is becoming obsolete, or that it is time for a requiem for the road warrior. Companies talk about using digital tools mainly as a way of making business travel more selective and more productive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the potential for digital displacement of business travel is substantial. A report last month by the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, a group of technology companies, and the Climate Group, an environmental organization, estimated that up to 20 percent of business travel worldwide could be replaced by Web-based and conventional videoconferencing technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most dedicated business travelers tend to be management consultants, investment bankers, accountants, lawyers and technology services consultants. Much of their work has to be done in person with clients. But these professionals are increasingly using online collaboration tools for work within their firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At I.B.M., Michael Littlejohn, a work force and technology expert in the company's global services unit, said two years ago, he was on the road 13 to 15 days a month. These days, he says, he travels 8 or 10 days a month. ''But my time spent with clients is not less,'' he said. ''To really understand a client's problems or to close a deal, you need face to face.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate training and education is a field many companies are moving online, in part to trim travel costs. Darryl Draper, the national manager of customer service training for <span class="companylink">Subaru of America</span>, used to travel four days a week, nine months of the year, presenting educational programs at dealers nationwide. Today, Ms. Draper rarely travels and nearly all of her training is done online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, Ms. Draper estimated, in six months she would reach about 220 people at a cost of $300 a person. She said she now reaches 2,500 people every six months at a cost of 75 cents a person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A range of companies offer the mainstream online communications and collaboration tools, including WebEx, Citrix, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, I.B.M. and others. The most rarefied offering, though, is telepresence videoconferencing. Today, it is an elite product supplied by a few companies, including <span class="companylink">Cisco</span>, H.P. and Polycom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed telepresence rooms, typically with three huge curved screens (and a fourth screen above for shared work), custom lighting and acoustics, cost up to $350,000 -- though that is down from $500,000, when H.P. sold its first system in early 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resolution on telepresence screens is even sharper than on high-definition televisions, and images can be magnified to inspect products. Engineers at the far-flung labs of <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices</span>, for example, scrutinize the microcircuitry on new chip designs using the company's telepresence systems. And the images of people on screen are life-size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Cisco</span>, which has more than 200 telepresence rooms, figures it is avoiding $100 million in yearly travel costs, and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from air travel by 10 percent. H.P. says air travel among its offices with telepresence rooms is down 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When used regularly, the rooms pay for themselves within a year, analysts estimate. Sales of telepresence systems will more than double this year to 627, estimates the market research firm IDC, and reach more than 8,000 by 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a certain paradox in telepresence, in that it is all to simulate the richest form of human interaction: people talking to each other, face to face.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is not a perfect substitute. Ms. Smart, the chief of human resources for Accenture, still travels about 10 days a month. ''You don't learn about other cultures in telepresence,'' she said. ''You get things from being there, over breakfast and dinner, building relationships face to face.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Two government reports have uncovered millions of dollars in federal contracts that were supposed to go to small businesses but instead were awarded to companies that had not qualified or had obtained the contracts fraudulently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one report, the inspector general for the Interior Department found that contracts listed as going to small businesses went to a dozen Fortune 500 corporations, including the <span class="companylink">Xerox Corporation</span> and the <span class="companylink">John Deere Company.</span> and the</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, based on a sampling of the department's small business contract awards in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, uncovered no fraud but found that large businesses received the contracts because of data entry errors, incorrect data and failure by contracting officials to verify the actual size of the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also said that in several cases, corporations appeared to have misrepresented themselves as small businesses on the federal contractor data base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xerox and John Deere said they were moving to correct those errors, and Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, called for all federal agencies to audit their small business contracting practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second report, by the Government Accountability Office, found that numerous private firms had tapped into the Small Business Administration's set-aside program for small businesses in economically distressed areas by falsely claiming they were located in a Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or HUBZone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten randomly selected companies in the Washington area, according to the agency, had set up virtual offices or rented mail boxes in poor communities solely to obtain a HUBZone business address. Over two years, those companies and others won more than $100 million in HUBZone contracts, according to the report presented to the House Committee on Small Business last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to wonder about a system that lets individuals self-qualify for a program of this size,'' said Nydia M. Velazquez, the New York Democrat who heads the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, the S.B.A. released a statement that outlined the steps it planned to take to correct the problems and verify that companies are eligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at the Interior Department said the inspector general's report uncovered only $5.7 million in misdirected contracts. That was a small fraction of the agency's overall small business contract awards, which totaled $1.39 billion in fiscal year 2006 and $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Earl E. Devaney, the department's inspector general, said what his audit team uncovered ''was the tip of the iceberg'' because it was based on a review of three-tenths of a percent of contracts from a cross-section of offices -- ranging from Indian affairs to surface mining -- in the huge department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are not just clerical mistakes that can be tagged on two little clerks,'' Mr. Devaney said. ''This is not one single report, but our fourth in the contracting area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P. Lynn Scarlett, the Interior Department's deputy secretary, said the department was ''working to correct these issues.'' Her office did not return further calls, and her statement was included in a response to the report by the S.B.A., which also monitors how well the federal government meets its small business contracting goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress has required that 23 percent of all federal contracts, which total more than $400 billion annually, be set aside for small businesses. Agencies are required to state whether they have met their annual contracting goals. But several inquiries, including one by the G.A.O. in 2003, have raised questions about the accuracy of the S.B.A.'s reporting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general's report ''is the latest maddening evidence that big businesses are being handed federal contracts that should be going to small businesses,'' Mr. Kerry said. He added that he would ''be sending letters to every federal agency asking them to audit their small business contracts and report back to the committee.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven C. Preston, the former administrator of the agency, adopted rules last year that small businesses recertify their size when they merge with a larger business or are at the five-year point in a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Small Business League, a small business association, said the problems with small business contracts went far deeper than even the inspector general found. The league's president, Lloyd Chapman, said large companies were getting the contracts not simply because of errors but because of ''the intentional diversion of federal small business contract dollars to Fortune 500 firms.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the Interior Department said it had awarded more than 55 percent of its contract dollars to small businesses. But the inspector general's evaluation said that contracting officers acknowledged that some of the companies were not small and ''were incorrectly coded as small.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the companies cited, John Deere, won more than $617,000 in small business contracts from the Interior Department in 2006 and 2007. The company, with 52,000 employees and revenue nearing $23 billion last year, said that it was moving to correct the errors in the government database that listed it as having $2 million in annual revenue and under 500 employees. The government defines a small business as one with fewer than 500 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A marketing unit of Deere had correctly listed the number of employees in that small business unit on a government form, and this number has been used by government agencies to define the entire Deere enterprise as a small business,'' said Ken Golden, a company spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Interior Department report also found that contracting officers ''failed to consistently check'' the central contractors registry to determine the company's true size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Xerox, William McKee, said the company's review of the central registry revealed ''several errors where business size was entered incorrectly'' from such agents, and said the company was going to correct the mistaken data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Xerox is not a small business, and has never attempted to portray itself as one,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gasoline prices may have moderated a bit lately, but business owners are still smarting from the run-up in prices this year.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Nicholson, owner of Company Flowers &amp; Gifts Too in Arlington, Va., was on Capitol Hill this week to tell members of Congress how his business has had to absorb higher costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Higher gas for our van alone runs more than $12 per delivery,'' he said, though he added that so far he has kept delivery charges at $9.50. ''We don't want to discourage our customers from sending flowers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he added, ''after a while I guess we'll have to raise prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plumbers, contractors, data couriers, florists, limousine companies and other small and midsize businesses that rely on driving are adapting to a volatile landscape in different ways -- whether through higher prices or creative, long-term fixes. Energy prices are still high enough, and the economy slow enough, that the changes made in the last few months by those businesses may well stick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the economic outcome remains uncertain, small-business owners are searching for innovative ways to reduce expenses and increase sales,'' said Bruce D. Phillips, senior fellow at the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the business owners say they are glad to make adjustments before the next problem arises. ''You can only see into the future so much,'' said David Rosenthal of Rosenthal Plumbing in Santa Cruz, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every six months or so Mr. Rosenthal tries crystal-ball gazing when it comes to fuel prices. If he's wrong about how much it will rise -- as he was this time with his recently published price list of services -- then his company has to offset the difference. ''I don't want to inflate prices to where it's uncomfortable to our client base,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Rosenthal Plumbing adopted global positioning system technology this summer to track its fleet of service trucks so it can deploy them more efficiently and increase the number of jobs technicians can handle in a day. It will soon install mobile navigation devices in each truck so that his employees can find the fastest routes and save on fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high gas prices this year cemented a decision by Sam's Limousine and Transportation in Houston to head in a new direction. It decided to sell its last two limousines, which seat eight. Replacing them are other vehicles to transport passengers, including party buses, sport utility vehicles and Town Cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party buses seat 16 to 20 passengers and have, according to the company's Web site, ''soft, black leather couch seating, a mirrored stargazer ceiling, opera lighting, laser lighting, strobe lighting, DVD screens and a custom stereo and sound system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Jones, vice president of the company, said he has recently seen ''an increase in larger groups pitching in and going out together,'' which makes the $130-an-hour rate affordable for a night out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is something that's been going on for a year now,'' Mr. Jones said. ''We have completely changed how we do business'' to accommodate those groups by buying four buses this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What small-business owners say they fear is that they will lose customers because of higher costs, putting even more pressure on their bottom line. In a recent survey by <span class="companylink">American Express</span>, the percentage of business owners reporting that they have lost sales, for reasons like an inability to deliver an order, has doubled to 35 percent from 17 percent last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The semiannual telephone survey of a representative sample of 621 owners this spring found that small-business owners are being squeezed by higher energy and gasoline costs. A third said they had raised prices, up from 26 percent who had reported raising prices last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RDS Delivery Service in New York, for instance, has raised prices because of fuel this year. If not for its moves to diversify the business over the last decade, it would be suffering the typical summer slowdown, plus the ill effects of rising fuel, which have hurt its small-business customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Zogby, its president, said the family-owned company added document storage and retrieval 10 years ago as well as critical parts storage five years ago to its courier businesses. The newest service, pick and pack, allows customers to store goods in its warehouses and have RDS pack orders and deliver them upon request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of this diversification is to build a ''longer and deeper relationship'' with customers, he said, and of course, not be completely reliant on its main business -- messenger and courier services in the New York region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, he said, he has seen more than a few smaller customers go out of business. One owner told him, ''If you're flat, you're ahead of the game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation, which surveys more than 3,500 owners via mail every four years about problems of greatest concern, reported in June that energy costs, excluding electricity, were the second most pressing concern after the cost of health insurance. Energy jumped two spots from the earlier survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary energy expenditure for 38 percent of the companies responding to the survey was to operate vehicles. Most small businesses cannot afford to switch to more energy-efficient vehicles, the authors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For four years, the economy provided a good, stable foundation for small business owners to do business,'' said Mr. Phillips, author of the report with Holly Wade, a policy analyst. ''But as it started to take a negative turn over the last several months, they felt the effects of rising costs of doing business as reflected by these results.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The VBP Group, of Scottsdale, Ariz., won the $1.2 million contract to manage a national training program for small businesses in September. The company was founded by Vernon B. Parker shortly after he left his job in 2006 as assistant secretary for civil rights at the Agriculture Department.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency confirmed on Wednesday that it had revoked the contract when it saw a draft of the inspector general's report, dated July 18, that found that VBP had not met the agency's requirements for the 8(a) contracting program and that VBP's approval was ''based on documents submitted by VBP that were false or of questionable authenticity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker did not return a call for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general investigated the contract -- 90 percent of the agency's budget to provide advice and training to small disadvantaged businesses seeking to win government contracts -- at the request of the House Small Business Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, VBP did not have the experience to merit a waiver from the program's requirement that contractors be in business for two years. Also, ''a more thorough validation'' of VBP's credentials, the report said, would have shown that its claims of Agriculture Department contracts were not valid and that bank deposit slips submitted from the department were for salary payments, not contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parker, according to the report, also ''falsely certified he was not a federal employee'' when he initially applied for contractor eligibility. But, the report said, he was, in fact, still employed at the Agriculture Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christine Mangi, the agency's spokeswoman, said, ''As soon as we saw the draft report, we took aggressive steps to terminate VBP's 8 (a) certification, cancel the contract, and develop and put in place stronger oversight procedures and training to see that something like this doesn't happen again.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Santanu K. Baruah, a former Commerce Department official, began serving this week as acting administrator of the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Bush appointed Mr. Baruah on Aug. 15 as acting administrator under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which allows him to remain in the post through the end of the current administration.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was nominated on June 26 but his confirmation ran into bipartisan concerns over several issues at the agency, particularly a multimillion-dollar provision for government contracts for female-owned businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, the agency issued a rule narrowly defining the women's government contracting program, which set off protests on Capitol Hill and among women's groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, accused President Bush on Thursday of circumventing the confirmation process and of undercutting efforts to open government contracting opportunities for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This nominee and the administration know that I am vehemently opposed to them moving forward with the unconstitutional women's procurement rule that makes it harder for women to access federal contracts,'' Mr. Kerry said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawmakers were further irked because the Small Business Administration sent a final draft of the women's contracting rule to the Office of Budget and Management. Its contents will not be officially released until October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents fear that despite having received some 1,600 comments since the rule was published in the Federal Register earlier this year, the agency has retained the narrow definition that elicited the protests in the first place. Critics say they believe that would flout Congress's 2000 mandate that female-owned businesses receive at least 5 percent of the $435 billion in annual government contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, who is the ranking minority member on the committee, tried to extract a pledge from Mr. Baruah on the issue at a meeting last month. Ms. Snowe said she ''demanded Mr. Baruah make a commitment to either withdraw this proposed rule or defer action on this issue until the next administration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baruah, who was assistant secretary for economic development at the Commerce Department, did not make a commitment. Even so, Ms. Snowe this week issued a statement welcoming his designation but urging him to ''rectify the administration's recent failure to implement a meaningful women's contracting rule.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although little known in the small-business community, Mr. Baruah spent more than two years at the Economic Development Administration, which gives development grants to communities that have suffered job losses for reasons like the movement of manufacturing overseas. Before joining the Bush administration, he worked for seven years as a senior consultant at the Performance Consulting Group in Portland, Ore., which had some big-name clients like <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> and <span class="companylink">Intel</span>. The firm closed in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baruah, 43, also served in the administration of George H. W. Bush, working as a legislative affairs officer in the Labor Department and as a confidential assistant for the Interior secretary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several small-business groups said it was beneficial to have an administration-selected agency head because the hurricane season was beginning, and a firm hand was needed to oversee the agency's disaster loan program. The program was overwhelmed after Hurricane Katrina, and the former administrator, Steven C. Preston, made overhauling the program a top priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen A. Kerrigan, president and chief executive of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, a small-business association, said Mr. Baruah's appointment would put the agency on solid footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kerrigan also said Mr. Baruah's economic development service gave him experience ''working with local communities and local businesses so he understands government interaction with communities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Small Business League, which has locked horns with the Small Business Administration over the awards of small-business contracts to large corporations, has been critical. Its president, Lloyd Chapman, has publicly worried that Mr. Baruah's goal is to either eliminate the Small Business Administration or fold it into the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chapman also said Mr. Baruah's lack of small-business experience meant he was not qualified for the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he took up the post last week, Mr. Baruah said in a statement that he planned to ''help S.B.A. carry on its mission as it navigates the height of hurricane season and deals with the current economic challenges and tightening credit opportunities for small business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said, through a spokeswoman, that he was too busy learning his new job for an interview, but the S.B.A.'s announcement emphasized that he ''has worked for small businesses, helped small businesses grow, and was raised by a mother who ran her own small business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be Ranee Baruah, who owned Ranee's Imported and Domestic Foods, a coffee, tea and spices store in Salem, Ore. It closed in the early 1990s, Mr. Baruah said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALI AFZAL, the 45-year-old owner of R. A. Fragrances and Perfumes, can enter a crowded room and tell who is wearing Jean Paul Gaultier, Givenchy or his personal favorite, Acqua di Gio from Armani.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Afzal's skills have not shielded him or the city's perfume district, which runs along Broadway from about 28th to 34th Street, from the nation's economic downturn. Behind the counter of his fragrant store near 31st Street, a modest space lined with boxes in pink, red and aquamarine, Mr. Afzal pointed out that the low value of the dollar hurts perfume merchants particularly because they buy their goods abroad. As a result, he has had to double some of his prices, and business has declined.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Afzal, a soft-spoken man with a closely cropped beard, was born in Pakistan and now lives with his wife and three children in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. One recent afternoon, as customers inspected the perfume boxes stacked nearly to the ceiling and haggled with his clerks over prices, Mr. Afzal talked about the life of a local perfume dealer. JOSEPH HUFF-HANNON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've owned this store for 10 years, and I've been in this industry for 17. Since this is the only job that I've had in the U.S., it's what I know. You have to keep on top of all the new perfumes, because new labels come out every month. One of the newest is Moschino Hippy Frizz; this has a fruity, summery scent. If you really want to be in this business, you need to have knowledge about the different scents, because there are very subtle differences. Some scents are citrusy, some are spicy, some are very bold, some are quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People feel better when they wear something that makes them feel nice, that makes them feel attractive. Who doesn't want to help people feel better?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here we do wholesale and retail; we know our customers well, and they are all complaining about the costs. One big problem now is that the prices are fluctuating so much. Something might cost me $20, and tomorrow it will cost me $22. A bottle of <span class="companylink">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span> that was $36 wholesale just a year ago, I'm now buying it for $56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar keeps falling, and as a retailer we don't have a lot of flexibility, because most of the perfumes are coming from Europe: Chanel, Drakkar Noir, Joop. We don't mark it up as much as they do at <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>. That's why people shop here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in this market, some customers are losing their trust because there are a lot more people selling fakes now, down on Canal Street, or out on the street here. That's another result of the dollar losing ground. People are getting priced out of the brands, so they are buying fakes instead. Earlier this year, some guys set up tables to sell bootleg perfumes right across the street from <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We used to have a lot of customers coming from South America, tourists from Brazil or Argentina, but we don't see many of them anymore. Now maybe because of the better currency exchange they can afford to buy it down there; they don't need to shop in New York. But most of our clientele is still Spanish-speaking. I speak a little bit of Spanish, a little bit of French. I learned it all working here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our busiest months are right before Christmas, but this past year was definitely slower. I have six people working with me in the store now. I'm lucky because I haven't had to lay anybody off, but I couldn't hire anybody else now either. Still, we all get along. Everybody works hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes I get very stressed out. Today I'm O.K., but there are many, many expenses -- salaries, electricians, so many different city taxes -- and our profit margin isn't that high. And in this neighborhood the rent goes up 15 or 20 percent every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past year they wanted to raise the rent 50 percent over three years. I negotiated something better, but at the end of the day this won't all add up. If our rents keep going up, and the price of perfume keeps going up, I don't know how long they'll be able to call this neighborhood the perfume district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the future I've been thinking of maybe just going into warehousing and shipping. But all of your orders come in by fax or e-mail, and I would miss having a store, talking to customers face to face. We have many regular customers, some of them have their own little stores, and they come in to buy three or four bottles of this or that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days the most popular perfume for women is Code, by Armani. Also Juicy Couture, that is a big one. The most expensive ones now are <span class="companylink">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span>, and the price has gone up and up and up. Many customers don't understand why. We have to explain that we aren't raising the price because we want to, but because we have to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My family is happy with my work. I bring my wife perfumes, and she wears whatever I bring home. She likes them all. My father is still in Pakistan; I visit once or twice a year. And yes, of course, when I go to visit, I always bring perfumes.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the stress that small-business owners face daily, it isn't surprising that they often think about hiring people they know well and believe they can trust: members of their family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision may have a happy ending, of course -- but not necessarily.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It might seem logical to look to those you rely on the most in your private life,'' writes Donna-Marie Coggins on smallbusinessdiva.com. But, she adds, appearances can be deceiving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because you get along in your personal life does not mean you will be compatible on the job, she writes. And the fact that you are no longer just the parent, sibling or spouse but the boss can damage the best of relationships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, she adds, there is substantial truth in the cliche that absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often the additional time spent together becomes a strain, even for married couples who've been together for years,'' she writes. ''There is definitely something to be said for time apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PROS AND CONS If you are ambivalent about hiring a relative, BusinessKnowledgeSource.comlays out the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are the cons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your relatives could take advantage of their status and not work as hard as they should.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other employees may be envious or jealous and think you are holding your relatives to a different standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal family disagreements may spill over into the workplace, making everyone uncomfortable. And, it says, ''Problems in the workplace may be brought home to the family.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And here are the pros:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You know what your relatives are good at -- and the places where they do not excel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatives may already know a lot about your company and how it works. That means you may not need to spend much time training them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your relatives may work harder than the average employee, because presumably they like you and do not want to let you down. ''They may be more willing to work longer hours (like evenings or weekends) when necessary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ESTABLISHING GROUND RULES It is possible to increase the odds that hiring a relative will work out, Gaebler Ventures, a business incubator and holding company, contends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It offers these suggestions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Establish clear dividing lines between workplace and personal issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Hold everyone -- family member and all other employees -- to the same standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Communicate with everyone in exactly the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we would add this: Make sure your relative is the best person for the job, before hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT COULD WORK For proof that a business that employs a lot of relatives can be successful, you need to look no further than the list of America's oldest family businesses. Family Business Magazine has listed, by founding date, the oldest 100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 1 , in terms of age: the <span class="companylink">Avedis Zildjian Company</span> in Norwell, Mass., which makes cymbals. It was founded in 1623. In fact, 17 of the companies on the list were in business before the American Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST CALL For a humorous look at the consequences of hiring relatives, consider the cartoons on the Web site of Grantland Enterprises, a communications consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of our favorites, a manager is lecturing an employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manager: ''The problem is when we hired your sister, we didn't know you were related. So it's your failure to disclose this fact that has caused the difficulty. I hope you have learned your lesson.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employee: ''I certainly have: Never try to do anything nice for your sister.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar power is in the midst of a boom in the United States. High energy costs are one reason. But what may be more important are generous state and power company incentives and rebates, as well as tax credits that make solar systems affordable to many more people and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This surge has, in turn, created hundreds, if not thousands, of small businesses, mostly contractors and installers.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are people like Glenn Barresi, an electrician in South Windsor, Conn., who got into the solar installation business in 2005, about a year after Connecticut instituted one of the most generous rebate programs in the country. His company, Solarbrite, has grown from two employees -- Mr. Barresi and his father -- to more than a half dozen. But, he said, if the rebates go away, ''I'm out of business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While industry groups and experts are not predicting a bust, they are raising concerns that growth is about to be tempered. The solar power industry is experiencing growing pains over how power is financed and distributed. In the end, larger companies may gain the upper hand, and the incentives could decrease or even disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think probably what we're going to see is the gradual disappearance of the very small one-, two-, three-person company that does everything,'' said Dave Ljungquist, associate director of project development at the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund, which administers the state's solar rebate program, has a list of more than two dozen approved installers, up from three when it began. ''We're going to see more larger companies where they have marketing specialists and where they can do enough business to get competitive pricing from distributors or the factory,'' Mr. Ljungquist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, estimates there are about 3,400 companies and organizations and 30,000 to 40,000 direct solar energy-related jobs in the United States, though calculating the overall economic benefit of the solar industry is difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Solar Center at North Carolina State University, which maintains a database, more than half the states now have rebates or incentives for solar power. Ninety-eight percent of solar installations are in those states, according to data compiled by Larry Sherwood, a consultant for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. California, with the longest standing, most highly developed incentive programs, has the greatest share of the activity, including several hundred installers. Perhaps more important, the state has a long-term commitment to the incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oregon, the number of installers has grown to 90 from 12 in about five years. And in an attempt to lure small manufacturers to Oregon, the state Economic and Community Development Department is offering incentives to businesses that make solar components like silicon, or devices like the inverters needed to transform solar energy from DC to AC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my mind, it's much better to have a program that's sustainable over time and not a program that puts in a bucketload of installations at one time and then shuts down,'' Mr. Sherwood said. ''Otherwise, companies come in and then they leave. You can't build a small-business infrastructure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey serves as an object lesson. Its generous rebate program had to be suspended after all the allotted money was spent. Contractors are finishing the backlog, but there is considerable uncertainty while the state's Board of Public Utilities develops a new program, at least part of which is likely not to involve rebates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Condit, the chief operations officer of Trinity Solar in Freehold, N.J., which evolved from a heating and air conditioning company, said the suspension of the rebate program was a worrisome reminder of the solar hot-water boom and bust of the mid-1980s. At that time, too, generous rebates and tax credits spawned dozens of small solar companies. Almost all went out of business when the programs abruptly ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For those who are here, we're hoping that doesn't happen'' again, Mr. Condit said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Chew said he had seen this kind of exuberance play out before. A survivor of the solar thermal era, he got back into the solar business, starting a company called SolarWrights in Rhode Island, when the state began an incentive program. He said he found himself on the brink again when it ended suddenly in 2006, but he survived by following the money to Connecticut, New York and eventually the rest of New England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New Hampshire just announced a new program, so we just opened up an office in Portsmouth,'' he said. ''We follow the incentives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's gone from one part-time employee -- himself -- to more than 60. Sales bookings last year were $5.9 million, more than double the year before, and he expects to hit $20 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Chew and others say incentives and rebates are only part of the solar small-business formula. ''I think the perception is that you have to always throw money at this industry,'' he said. ''The incentive should be a crutch to help the industry grow until the crutch is no longer needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffery Wolfe and his wife founded groSolar in Vermont in 1998. Today, the company has 90 employees, distributes solar products nationally and does installations in a number of states. Mr. Wolfe said he expected sales to reach $60 million this year, about double last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incentives, he said, helped him get to this point. But he added: ''It's a push and pull. Incentive programs create some market'' for solar that ''help create awareness that help create the culture that makes more demand for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal tax credits have also been playing a role in creating demand, especially for commercial projects where the credits are worth 30 percent of the cost of a system. The industry has been worried that Congress will adjourn without extending the credits past their Dec. 31 expiration. It is still unclear if legislation to extend and even increase some of them will pass before Congress recesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the credits expire, no one thinks the industry will disappear. The energy landscape is much changed and quality control much improved since the solar thermal debacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What may also determine whether small businesses will continue to dominate the industry are the so-called power purchase agreements. Those agreements are much like leasing a car. Instead of owning a solar system, a homeowner or business essentially leases power from a system on its property that is owned by another company. Such arrangements may be best managed by large companies, and there is already evidence that they are becoming popular alternatives, especially for commercial projects, when the initial cost is a stumbling block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, where the groundwork is being set for a unique commercial arrangement that will put a large amount of solar power into the grid, there is little concern that it will curb the enthusiasm for solar. Some 1,300 systems have been installed since the <span class="companylink">Long Island Power Authority</span> instituted its rebate program in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordian Raacke, executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, which provides contractor listings, said he received calls almost daily from companies that wanted to be added. ''This is the very beginning of what I think will be a very rapidly expanding market,'' he said. ''You ain't seen nothing yet.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH small-business loans and second mortgages scarce these days, some middle-age entrepreneurs are starting companies using their retirement savings, a novel financing method that they say avoids loan payments and early withdrawal penalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These business owners are effectively treating their start-up ventures as any other stock in their 401(k) portfolio, and in the process they are providing seed capital for their own budding enterprises. In some cases they are even paying themselves a salary as their businesses start generating cash.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a risky strategy, one that has business owners essentially betting their retirement on their company. But beyond that, it is a controversial, considering that the same person is serving as financier, chief executive and salaried employee. And because it is all being fueled by pretax retirement dollars, the tax consequences are unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that has not stopped several advisory firms and hundreds of their clients from promoting it as the ultimate start-up strategy that, during a widespread market crisis, lets you invest in the one thing you have control over: yourself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With credit tighter than it has been in decades, ''a banker friend told me that I'd have more luck robbing a bank than borrowing from one,'' said George Richards of Providence, R.I., who used the retirement financing tactic to invest the $150,000 he had in his Individual Retirement Account to buy a liquor store near Brown University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Richards, 46, turned his back on the corporate world after <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> cut his engineering job three years ago and he found himself in what he described as a dreadful job as a mortgage broker. He decided to take ''an undervalued grungy little college liquor store and make it a fun place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he added, ''I'm creating an asset I want to be a part of, instead of just stumbling along on a career path at some big company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Mickey of Chicago came upon the retirement-financing idea last spring as he sought to become an independent businessman for the first time by buying a franchise after about 20 years working for big companies. He zeroed in on Adventures in Advertising, a company in Neenah, Wis., that makes promotional items like pens, coffee mugs and golf balls imprinted with company logos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He needed $30,000 to buy the franchise rights, but with no track record as a business owner, he knew he could not get a small-business loan from a bank. A home equity loan was also not an option, because he had not owned his home long enough to build much equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So his franchise consultant suggested that he look to his 401(k) retirement accounts, worth about $160,000 combined. That gave him several options. He could simply cash out some of the balance, but at age 46 he would have paid a hefty penalty tax for early withdrawal. Or he could borrow against his holdings, but that would have saddled his young company with the overhead of monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't want to have a loan to pay off, and I didn't want to be taxed up the wazoo for cashing out the 401(k),'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That led him to BeneTrends of North Wales, Pa., one of the leading promoters of 401(k) start-up financing, which walked him through the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First he would start a C corporation, a designation that allows a company to issue private shares of stock. Then he would create a profit-sharing retirement plan within his corporation, making it eligible to accept pretax retirement contributions. Finally, he would roll over about half of his retirement savings, roughly $80,000, from his 401(k) into the profit-sharing plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the profit-sharing plan could buy the franchise rights and also provide working capital for his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since July he has landed about eight clients. Adventures in Advertising processes the orders and takes a fee of 6 to 10 percent. He paid BeneTrends about $5,000 for its services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company, Burly Bear Promotions, pays him a salary of about $100,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tactic that Mr. Richards and Mr. Mickey used to start their companies is so novel that many business analysts, tax experts and even Internal Revenue Service officials said they had never heard of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such expert, Edgar Adkins, a partner in the national tax office at Grant Thornton who specializes in compensation and benefits, said, ''It's an interesting concept.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, Mr. Adkins said, the trickiest part would be to make sure that the start-up company complies with a federal tax rule governing company-sponsored retirement plans. For such a plan to qualify for tax-deferred contributions and a tax deduction for the company, he said, it must be used for the ''exclusive benefit'' of employees and not primarily to benefit the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also warned against taking a sizable salary out of the company. ''Any tax deductions for corporations, for any expense like a salary, has to be an 'ordinary and reasonable' amount,'' he said. ''When you pay compensation, particularly when it's going to the owner, the I.R.S. looks closely at what's reasonable. The I.R.S. suspicion is that you are paying yourself a disguised dividend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference is that a dividend is subject to a corporate tax and another tax after it is paid to an investor. A salary, by contrast, is taxed as ordinary income, but the company can take a tax deduction, Mr. Adkins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.R.S. said it could not comment about retirement financing. But a spokesman, Dean Patterson, said in an e-mail message: ''We are looking at these types of transactions because they raise complex tax and benefit issues. Before entering into any tax arrangement, the I.R.S. always reminds taxpayers that they should discuss it with a trusted tax professional.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advisory firms that advocate retirement financing, including BeneTrends, SD Cooper and Guidant Financial, say they can shelter most of the profits from taxes by turning them back into retirement contributions, thus replenishing the initial retirement cash and deferring taxes. They also say that companies started in this way are more likely to survive the tough-going early years, because they are not weighed down by debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is always risky to bet your retirement on one company, big or small. But Mr. Richards, the liquor store owner, said he was comfortable with that risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would bet on myself and my abilities any day,'' he said. ''I don't know who I'd rather bet on than me.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VALUE-ADDED junk hauling may sound like a questionable product to sell: it assumes that people will pay hundreds of dollars to get rid of ratty sofas and assorted flotsam in professional and socially conscious ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its biggest selling points are friendly employees who presumably look more respectable than the local odd jobber, and who will, unlike the far less expensive city garbage collector, climb into that nasty basement or garage to haul out your junk.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet to the bafflement of industry experts, quality junk-hauling sells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Omar Soliman and Nick Friedman, the 26-year-old founders of College Hunks Hauling Junk, based in Tampa, Fla. The pair started the company in Washington five years ago and now employ 25 people there; they also have franchises in 15 metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sending out college students in golf shirts and khakis, College Hunks had $2.9 million in business last year. Mr. Soliman and Mr. Friedman said they expected sales of $4 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company charges by the size of the cargo: for an eighth of a truck, a quarter and so on, up to $500 for a full load, or $99 for a single item. Extra charges apply for some concrete, dirt, construction materials and other loads. And they will not remove some materials at all, like combustibles and other hazardous waste. The haulers promise to recycle and donate what they can -- and say that it's to their advantage to eliminate as much as possible this way, because they pay by the pound for whatever they drop off at the dump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of College Hunks' business comes from homeowners in upscale neighborhoods who discard many items that the company takes to <span class="companylink">Goodwill Industries</span> instead of to the dump. While some charities offer pickup services, they may be selective in what they accept and may not clean out a space, Mr. Friedman said, adding, ''Calling College Hunks gets the stuff out in one sweep.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 30 percent of the company's revenue comes from businesses -- property managers, for example, who hire the company to clear rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College Hunks has sold 36 franchises since January 2007, each requiring a minimum investment of $75,600, which includes a $25,000 franchise fee, to get started. ''In our minds, we want to have 80 to 125 franchise partners across the country,'' said Mr. Soliman, the chief executive. ''We think we can do that within three years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the beginning, their business plan called for franchising, as the least expensive way to expand the company. By the summer of 2006, when 12-month revenues were up to about $500,000, Mr. Friedman and Mr. Soliman had enough cash from operations to spend around $250,000 for lawyers and consultants to roll out a franchise plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the expenses were setting up a call center that could take orders from around the country and software that would allow customers to search online for College Hunks by ZIP code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also hired George Palmer, 63, as director of franchise development. ''I've been in franchising for more than 30 years; that's longer than the College Hunks have been on the face of the earth,'' Mr. Palmer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His job is to arrange support for the franchisees, including marketing materials designed for specific customers, like real estate agents, bankers or moving companies. He also hosts conference phone calls with franchisees, where tips are shared -- on good insurance rates, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the College Hunks plan sounds familiar, that is probably because a company called <span class="companylink">1-800-GOT-JUNK</span>? has already done it. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, <span class="companylink">1-800-GOT-JUNK</span>? sells the same services as College Hunks, and it has blanketed the United States and Canada with more than 300 franchises in the last nine years. It reported $121.37 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Friedman said College Hunks was already the largest junk-hauling business based in the United States, and that <span class="companylink">1-800-GOT-JUNK</span>? was the only competitor with more than a few trucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College Hunks -- whose phone number is a similar 1-800-JUNK-USA (its Web site is 1800junkusa.com) -- is undaunted by the competition. While Mr. Friedman said <span class="companylink">1-800-GOT-JUNK</span>? ''is the <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> of the junk-hauling business,'' he said his company just wanted to be ''the <span class="companylink">Burger King</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Franchise consultants say there is nothing wrong with that strategy. They point out that Wendy's did not enter the fast food market until about two decades after <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> invented it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College Hunks was conceived in the summer of 2003, when Mr. Friedman was a college intern at the International Monetary Fund in Washington and when Mr. Soliman started picking up junk for cash. The two, who have known each other since attending Sidwell Friends School in Washington, hauled junk together on weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They split about $9,000 that summer. Then Mr. Soliman returned to the University of Miami and Mr. Friedman to Pomona College in California for their senior years, but their phones kept ringing for hauling jobs in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Soliman drew up a business plan for College Hunks and entered it in the Leigh Rothschild Entrepreneurship Competition at his university. He took first place and won $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After graduating with a business degree, Mr. Soliman took a marketing job in Washington and used his prize money to restart the junk business on the side. Mr. Friedman helped, but he had an economics degree by then and a job at a consulting company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I created spreadsheets, economic research to help billion-dollar businesses make more billions,'' he said. Six months later, he left to join Mr. Soliman and the junk business full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They recruited haulers from the University of Maryland, in nearby College Park, and area community colleges, paying them $11 an hour, with bonuses of $20 to $50 a shift if a customer called in and complimented their work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's name notwithstanding, the haulers don't have to be hunky, Mr. Friedman said, but ''clean-cut,'' which he defines as well-groomed with no prominent piercings or tattoos. There is also at least one Hunkette, as they call a female hauler, and women also work in the corporate office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Soliman and Mr. Friedman designed a logo with a cartoonish muscle man and invented a slogan: ''Let tomorrow's leaders haul your junk today!'' They put out fliers and door hangers and handed out business cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before their 25th birthdays, they were ready to franchise, and they obtained a toll-free phone number with the word junk in it, paying a Michigan medical company $13,000 for 1-800-JUNK-USA. The number helped their marketing efforts immensely, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was easy to remember and sounds like a national company,'' Mr. Soliman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big waste-collection companies might pose formidable competition if they pursued junk hauling, but they haven't so far, and some of them openly disdain the idea of collecting junk from inside homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I question the need and the appropriateness of companies like <span class="companylink">1-800-GOT-JUNK</span>?'' said Robert Reed, a spokesman for Norcal Waste Systems, based in San Francisco. The company collects garbage for San Francisco and nearby cities, and it recycles about 60 percent of what it collects in its facilities, Mr. Reed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most homeowners get free or inexpensive pickup of bulk items from the curb once or twice a year as part of their city garbage collection, Mr. Reed said. So why would people spend $400?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most people are able-bodied and can haul their own stuff,'' he said. ''You just get a dolly, which most people have in their garage, and pull it out to the curb.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sentiments were echoed at the National Solid Wastes Management Association, a trade group whose members include large trash companies, and in Waste Age, a publication that covers the waste-hauling industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at <span class="companylink">1-800-GOT-JUNK</span>?, Launi Skinner, the president and chief operating officer, said quality hauling services were needed because ''everyone in our society has junk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sometimes it takes a sense of humor to move it. Among the College Hunks is Kevin Burns, a 21-year-old student who is also a full-time employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mr. Burns was working on a job at a small apartment in Tampa. Magazines, notebooks, plastic soda bottles, lamp parts, 1980s electronics and, inexplicably, feathers covered every surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While her 10-pound Chihuahua yapped furiously, the resident, Deirdre Blancett, asked the haulers to remove the sleeper sofa, the television, the computer desk -- pretty much all of her furniture -- and whatever was on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the job was about half done, Ms. Blancett's nephew, Brian Vans Evers, arrived. Noting the College Hunks sign on the truck, he spat tobacco juice and remarked that college students had time for junk hauling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burns introduced himself and finished filling the truck. Then he slapped a College Hunks magnet on the tailgate of Mr. Vans Evers's pickup and said he hoped he could work for him again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vans Evers looked at the magnet, just above his ''Yur Followeeng a Rednek'' bumper sticker. The house his aunt is moving into has more junk than this apartment, he said, adding that ''maybe we'll give you a call.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY of America's small-business owners are scrambling for cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although experts do not yet have hard data about how the financial turmoil of the last few weeks may hamper entrepreneurs' access to capital, many were already having difficulties getting financing before the escalation in the credit crisis.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, financing options for all stages of the small-business cycle are limited. Typically, start-ups and unprofitable companies have relied on credit cards and home equity loans. As their businesses thrived, they often turned to bank credit lines. And when it was time for the next big growth spurt, they usually got a small-business loan. But all of these options are less feasible now than they were a short while ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, after a quarterly survey of senior loan officers in July, the Federal Reserve reported that 65 percent of domestic banks said they had tightened their lending standards for small-business loans over the previous three months. At the same time, 70 percent told the Fed that they were charging more for those loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in an August opinion poll, two-thirds of entrepreneurs told the National Small Businesses Association that their companies had been hurt by the credit crunch. Todd McCracken, the organization's president, said that members tended to own larger and more profitable businesses, so he thought that the credit crunch was probably having an even greater impact on America's small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you think you might have a cash crunch, you should act now,'' Mr. McCracken said, adding that it would be better for many small-business owners to have cash on hand, even if that meant paying a little extra interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But small-business owners are not without financing options, even in these tenuous times, especially if they have strong enterprises with solid balance sheets. If, on the other hand, their businesses rely on a particularly shaky area of the economy -- like the housing or auto markets -- then some small-business experts advise them to reassess the wisdom of taking on more debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Above all, entrepreneurs will need more of a financial stake in their own companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bankers are more selective than they were a year ago about the businesses they choose to finance, and the owner is going to have to have more equity in the deal,'' said Ken Esch, a partner at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> in the private company services group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could also be a bad time for owners with established companies to take equity out of their businesses -- no matter how tempting that may seem, given the sinking values of their personal brokerage accounts or home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many small-business owners don't keep enough money in their businesses,'' said Robert C. Seiwert, the head of the Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking at the American Bankers Association. ''They take it out for lifestyle reasons. Bankers don't like to see that. They don't want to support someone's lifestyle in the form of a small-business loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiwert also advised owners to strengthen their business plans, especially if they had not recently updated them. ''They should have three scenarios -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- and they should be prepared to execute on all of them,'' he said. ''And if their business plan is based on expansion, I would revisit those assumptions given the economic uncertainty today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some small-business owners who are finding it difficult to get a credit line with a bank may be tempted to carry large balances on their business credit cards. But the terms can change suddenly, just as they can with personal credit cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William L. Treciak has spent the entire 20 years of his working life in the credit card payment-processing industry. Five years ago, he founded his own company, Electronic Data Payment Systems, which is based in Dover, Ohio, and processes credit card transactions for merchants. He found it ironic that even he was ensnared by escalating credit card interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Treciak said he was offered a small-business card with an interest rate of 11.99 percent in mid-2006. That was lower than interest rates on his company's bank credit lines at the time, so he took the deal. But then, he said, the card company raised his rates six times, to reach 34.99 percent this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, I paid the balance off and shut the card down,'' said Mr. Treciak, who added that he had never been late for a payment and had never given the company any other cause to raise his rates. ''I grew up in this industry, so I knew better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial experts say this situation demonstrates why small-business owners should opt for a small-business credit line at a bank -- if they can qualify for one. But even a bank credit line may not be a sure thing, especially if a small business encounters an obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Boothe, who owns Allstates Refractory Contractors, in Waterville, Ohio, said his bank closed his credit line after a difficult year in 2005, when he suffered his first loss since buying the business in 2002. In early 2006, Mr. Boothe's bank said it was closing his $50,000 revolving credit line and issuing him a five-year note for the balance of $47,000. This debt had a fixed interest rate of 10.5 percent, which he said was two percentage points higher than the credit line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boothe said that his business, which fixes industrial furnaces, had become profitable again over the last two years and that he had tried to open another credit line with several banks, to no avail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esch, of <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>, said business owners who were relying on short-term debt -- like revolving credit lines or credit card balances -- should try to convert it into long-term debt, like a small-business loan. ''Companies that converted to a long-term debt structure a year ago are much less dependent on the credit markets, which are very volatile today,'' Mr. Esch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the number of new loans backed by the federal Small Business Administration has dropped sharply over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the number of loans backed by a major federal loan-guarantee program fell 30 percent over the last 12 months. The average size of the small-business agency loans went up, though, because most of the shortfall had come from smaller loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank loan officers -- not the government -- make lending decisions for all Small Business Administration-backed loans, so the federal agency does not have data on whether tighter lending standards or a decline in applications led to this trend. But Eric Zarnikow, the associate administrator for the office of capital access at the Small Business Administration, said it was probably a little of both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we talk to loan officers, we are consistently hearing that demand is down,'' Mr. Zarnikow said. ''They are saying that small-business owners are less willing to take on additional debt, and the borrowers who do come to us are less creditworthy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is little doubt that some who might have qualified for small-business loans a year or two ago -- when lending standards were much more relaxed -- are finding it tougher today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Mr. Treciak, who owns the credit card processing company in Ohio, said his small-business loan applications had been turned down about eight times during the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Behar, who owns Jennifer's Homemade, a bakery in Miami, said she too was finding it hard to get her first traditional small-business loan. Ms. Behar, who describes herself as a ''self-taught baker,'' sells her chocolate biscotti and rosemary flatbread in fashionable grocery stores like Dean &amp; DeLuca andWhole Foods Market, and on jennifershomemade.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Behar started her business in 2005 with a home equity loan and a small-business credit card from <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. She qualified for a bank credit line of $50,000 in 2006. After her revenues doubled in 2007, she asked her bank to double her credit line to $100,000, which it did in April. But Ms. Behar said she had been turned down by several banks for a loan to help finance her company's growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If owners can't get the credit they need for their businesses, they might consider giving up some equity. Mr. Treciak and Ms. Behar said they were considering selling a stake in their companies to investors or venture capitalists -- an option both said they probably would not have considered had they received business loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Behar has asked the Global Entrepreneurship Center at Florida International University for advice. ''They are helping me figure out how much money I really need, and how much I am willing to give up,'' she said ''Certainly I want to control the business and run it the way I want to.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GIVEN the economic climate, small-business owners may be loath to make major purchases of new equipment or furnishings this year. But for those with money and an inclination to spend it, now is a good time to buy, as Congress enacted generous tax incentives for this year only. Businesses considering major expenditures may realize significant tax savings if they act promptly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 allows businesses to take an immediate write-off of up to $250,000 for equipment purchased this year, double the amount allowed in 2007. Businesses that place the assets in service this year are entitled to an additional 50 percent depreciation.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and certified public accountant, gave this example: ''Say a small business bought $600,000 worth of equipment and placed it in service -- it could write off the $250,000, and half the remaining $350,000. That's a total first-year write-off of $425,000. The remaining $175,000 would have to be depreciated. If it's seven-year equipment, that would mean writing off $25,000 a year over the next seven years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the tax code, seven-year equipment includes office furniture and fixtures, safes, refrigerators and dishwashers and certain manufacturing machinery. Depreciation periods can vary, based on the equipment involved. Computers and copiers, for example, are given a five-year depreciation period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., pointed out that a taxpayer must have earned income to claim the equipment write-offs, but that any earned income, not just that from the business, will suffice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an example, he noted the case of a person who lost his job recently and decided to open a restaurant. The cost of equipment and furnishings exceeds the income he expects the restaurant to earn this year, but because he received a salary for several months and because his wife is employed, as joint filers they will be able to write off the restaurant equipment against that income, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immediate write-off and resulting tax savings could give many businesses a welcome cash-flow advantage during a tough economic period. Of course, many businesses are too small to make such big purchases or simply do not have the need. But tax professionals say other fourth-quarter opportunities for tax savings are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., and author of ''J. K. Lasser's Small Business Taxes,'' said that even the smallest businesses may need to buy a car, truck or van, and the stimulus act grants a special first-year depreciation allowance for business vehicles in 2008. For cars it is $10,960; for trucks and vans, it rises to $11,160.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both limits are $8,000 higher than the previous first-year depreciation limit. As a result, many businesses that had once thought it better to lease vehicles may now want to consider buying them, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent laws may also provide tax breaks for certain small businesses, Ms. Weltman said. Under the military tax bill enacted in June, small businesses that employ and continue to pay National Guard and Reserve members who are called to active duty may be able to claim a tax credit of up to $4,000 per eligible employee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for first-time homebuyers with income of up to $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for couples filing jointly. A partial credit is available to those with up to $20,000 more in income. This could benefit people who have a cramped home office in a rental apartment and are considering buying a home or apartment at today's depressed prices, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A credit reduces taxes dollar for dollar, making it more valuable than a deduction, which simply reduces taxable income. This credit may be claimed on home purchases after April 9 of this year and before July 1, 2009, but taxpayers should be aware that the credit must be repaid, starting within two years, at a rate of up to $500 annually for 15 years. The home must be the buyer's principal residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to a tax-deferred retirement plan is always one of the best ways to reduce taxes in the year of the contribution while laying the foundation for a secure future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avery E. Neumark, a partner in the New York accounting firm Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin &amp; Company, says he is advising owners of small businesses to set up 401(k) retirement plans if they have not already done so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal law does not require businesses to offer retirement plans to employees, but it forbids those that offer plans from discriminating in favor of top executives. Consequently, many small businesses, especially those that employ large numbers of unskilled workers, have traditionally shunned sponsoring plans, fearing their expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appeal of a 401(k) is that workers, as well as the owners, pay for their own retirement contributions through salary deferrals. Participants may defer up to $15,500 this year, and those 50 or older may defer an additional $5,000. ''If the company wants to match contributions or not, it's their choice,'' Mr. Neumark said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Neumark added that a solo practitioner or a business with only a few professional employees might want a defined-benefit plan and a profit-sharing plan, as well as a 401(k), because those individuals can put away far greater amounts, something that appeals especially to people approaching retirement age. For example, a 50-year-old earning $225,000 might put $175,000 into a defined benefit plan, $20,500 into a 401(k) plan and $13,500 into a 6 percent profit-sharing plan for a total of $209,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy in turmoil, no one can predict what will happen with tax policy next year. Still, with the potential for tax increases, many professionals favor action this year to take advantage of low rates on capital gains and most dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kess, the New York lawyer and accountant, advised closely held incorporated businesses that are in a position to pay a dividend to do so before the end of the year. If some of the company's stock is owned by family members like children or elderly parents who are in the 10 or 15 percent bracket, they will owe no tax on the dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current long-term capital gains tax rate of 15 percent might also make it advantageous to sell a business now, Ms. Weltman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN this factory town in south-central Michigan, hard hit by the decline of the auto industry and home to a population whose health grimly lags well below national averages, several dozen small-business owners have joined forces in a wellness campaign that rivals those of the country's giant corporations.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fewer employees to rely on, small businesses are particularly vulnerable when workers take sick days or function poorly on the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they're not healthy and alert, they can't do things like designing projects,'' said Mike Shirkey, owner of Orbitform Group, a machine tools company with 55 employees in Jackson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, Mr. Shirkey compares the wellness program with the ''measure and improve'' approach that he applies to manufacturing. Two years ago, Mr. Shirkey helped persuade other business owners in Jackson to join a CEO Roundtable, a forum and self-help group for top executives that is trying to address employees' health as a crucial part of corporate strategy, rather than as simply a cost-management problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Mercer, president of R. W. Mercer, a Jackson-based contractor that builds small factories, doctors' offices and other commercial buildings in the Midwest, said he was so taken with this approach that he was urging his small subcontractors, each with a handful of employees, to join the wellness roundtable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, businesspeople share ideas and encourage one another, but each business makes its own health-care decisions and pays for whatever coverage it provides; there is no pooling of employees for insurance purposes or to achieve other economies of scale, and no government contribution to the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the strategy works, the result will probably be healthier workers and lower medical costs, and that will be striking, when many small businesses are unable to provide any health coverage at all -- and one in seven Americans is uninsured. At least half of them work for small companies or are self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promoting wellness is especially urgent in Jackson, whose residents have more health problems than people living elsewhere, according to a recent survey paid for by the Allegiance Health system, which operates the local hospital; the county health department; and other local agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jackson County, 70 percent of adults are overweight or obese, compared with 63 percent nationally, and 14 percent have diabetes, well above the 9 percent national rate. More than 1 in 4 is a smoker, compared with 1 in 10 nationally. Many people in the county do not realize they are taking serious chances with their health, the survey found; they do not have insurance and cannot afford health services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson's economic health is shaky as well. As the city's population has declined slowly to about 34,000, median household income has fallen to $31,000, a third less than Michigan as a whole, and the countywide (metropolitan area) unemployment rate has climbed to 9.7 percent, compared with 9.1 percent statewide in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, Jackson has several claims to fame. It calls itself the birthplace of the Republican Party, noting that on July 6, 1854, the party formally organized itself and held its first convention here, according to the city's Web site; among those in attendance was Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson was a major rail hub and the onetime headquarters of Buick Motors, and it remains home to a state prison, now more than a century old, that looms over the city like a medieval fortress and was for decades the largest prison in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Jackson's wellness initiative succeeds, the small city may once again be at the forefront of a national trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several states, including Maryland, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, have recently required insurance companies to offer wellness benefits to employees of small businesses, and a foundation-financed business group in Colorado, with encouragement from Lt. Gov. Barbara O'Brien, is also planning a wellness program for small- and medium-size employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the broad national debate about health care, Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate for president, has proposed a tax credit for small businesses to help them pay health insurance premiums for their employees. His Republican rival, Senator John McCain, has called for every family to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay for insurance, while making employees' health benefits taxable as income. Mr. McCain has recommended incentives to reduce costs, including disease management and health and wellness programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter what kinds of changes are made in the health system, many policy experts are counting on wellness and disease-management programs to slow the relentless rise of medical costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jackson, the two largest employers are Consumers Energy, the local power company; and Allegiance Health, the local hospital, and the latter has been especially involved in the initiative. ''We hope we can develop ways for the providers and payers to work together,'' said Georgia Fojtasek, a nurse with a doctorate in education who is the chief executive of Allegiance Health. Allegiance administers the wellness program and spends $2 million annually to support community health projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the small-business participants in the wellness program is Bob Lefere, president of the Pioneer Foundry, which is paying for a nicotine patch to help a 30-year-old mold maker quit smoking. He was the last smoker on the foundry's 15-person staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The link between smoking and dangerous lung and heart problems is widely recognized, and some large companies require workers who smoke to pay higher premiums unless they at least try to quit. Pioneer Foundry, a union shop for 50 years, already provides for annual physicals and 12 months of infant care under its contract with the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union. Mr. Lefere said that when contract talks open next year, he might propose adding a health club membership for workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orbitform has already installed a fitness center, with exercise machines and showers that workers can use at lunchtime and before and after work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Great Lakes Industry, which makes power-transmission equipment and auto parts, Larry Schultz, the president, marshaled some fellow exercise enthusiasts to clean up a storage area and transform it into a small fitness center. Mr. Schultz also got rid of the candy machines and offers free fruit and vegetable snacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running on one of its treadmills helped Gary Lykins, a shipping and customer service manager at Great Lakes Industry, shed 45 pounds he had gained after he left the factory floor for a more sedentary job. ''I run 100 miles a month on that thing,'' Mr. Lykins said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great Lakes Industry and Orbitform also pay for health coaches, provided by Allegiance Health, who meet several times a year with employees and their spouses to guide them toward goals like losing weight, eating healthy food and lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of things you just don't think about until somebody sits down with you and explains,'' said Robert Dean, 36, a machinist who works the night shift at Great Lakes Industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife Sarah, 28, said she had not smoked for almost two years after they met with a coach for the first time. ''We both smoked before that, and we tried to quit a lot of times,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Dean, who operates a day care center for 11 toddlers, said she put on weight after she and Robert were married. ''I didn't have to fit into my dress anymore,'' she said. ''It was kind of a mental thing.'' Now, with daily exercising and dutifully eating fruits and vegetables, she has slimmed down. ''I fit into a size 8,'' she said. ''I haven't fit into an 8 since sixth grade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great Lakes Industry, which is self-insured, offers single employees a $681-a-year reduction in their health insurance premiums if they participate in the wellness program. Married employees get the same reduction and an additional $681 discount for their spouses, who are required to join. The deductible is also waived, and co-payments for medical services are halved to 10 percent for participating workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health coaches help establish goals for the workers, who are expected to ''make an honest effort'' to reach them, Mr. Schultz said. The coaches give special attention to people with chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Great Lakes Industry added fully paid health ''prevention benefits,'' including immunization shots and physical exams. Participants must select a primary-care doctor and follow her recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 95 percent of its 65 or so employees participating in the program, health costs for Great Lakes Industry employees average $7,363 each last year, including $200 for the coach. That was down from $9,158 in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''return on investment is difficult to measure,'' Mr. Schultz said, because a small company's health costs were likely to be erratic from year to year, with variables like births, accidents and illnesses. He is estimating an average cost of $8,095 for 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe we have at least flattened or dampened the trend line,'' he said, referring to annual cost increases. His employees have been paying 14 to 20 percent of total costs, and he does not want to shift more of the costs to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are factory folks,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''Health care is an important benefit. I don't believe the solution to the cost problem is to shift more to families. If they are actively participating in improving their health, we as an employer can afford to provide them with a rich benefit plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His daughter, Dr. Amy M. Schultz, began learning about health insurance when she helped out at Great Lakes Industry as a teenager; now she is director of prevention and community health at the local hospital, and she works with Prof. Dee Edington, director of the University of Michigan Health Management Research Center, which advises the Jackson programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Participants fill out questionnaires about their medical history and health-related behavior, and the health risk appraisals and analyses for the employers are conducted through the U.M. Health Management Research Center, Dr. Schultz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Sponsler, the president of Orbitform, said he was ''a big proponent'' of the program. He is 6-foot-3 and weighed 248 pounds when he learned that his blood pressure was high, he said. Now he gets up early and works out with a friend (who happens to be his cardiologist). When he gets to work at 6:30 a.m., he eats his own concoction of cereal, nuts, olive oil, flax seed and cinnamon for breakfast. He said he now weighs 231 and his blood pressure is managed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fojtasek of Allegiance Health said businesspeople on the hospital's board, like Mr. Shirkey and Mr. Schultz, had encouraged the hospital to push for health improvements in Jackson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy employees are good for business in more ways than one, Mr. Schultz said, adding, ''We treat our customers and each other better when we are feeling good.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the special Small Business section on Oct. 1 about Web sites that match investors with start-up companies misstated the amount of money that Growthink, a venture firm, invested in eAssay.com, a jewelry- purchasing business. The managing partner for Growthink, Jay Turo, said his firm did not invest the $500,000 that the match-making Web site Raise- Capital.com said it invested, but he would not specify the size of the investment. (Mr. Turo was contacted for comment about the $500,000 amount before publication, but he did not deny or confirm the amount at that time.)</p>

All he needed was capital, and quickly. But he had exhausted his credit with conventional lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, in Los Angeles, Jay Turo and his company, Growthink, were looking for profitable investments.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the Web site RaiseCapital.com, founded in March 2007 and based in Port Washington, N.Y., they found each other. Without even a face-to-face meeting, Growthink, a venture investment firm, put $500,000 into Mr. Sheftel's business, eAssay, this year and is already seeing returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a financial counterpart to online dating services, companies like RaiseCapital, Go4Funding and Go Big Network are giving small businesses a new way to meet prospective investors. And with turmoil in the financial markets, credit tightening and uneasiness about the conventional financial system, these companies hope to provide opportunities to invest, to lend and to borrow -- and to find a market for these services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you have a bunch of smart, ambitious people suddenly flood the market, it makes sense that a lot of new companies will be formed,'' said Bob Goodson, the chief executive of YouNoodle, which is trying to bring together entrepreneurs and investors. ''Investments in start-ups are highly volatile, but at least it's a sector that's upfront about the risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Bertsch, president and co-founder of RaiseCapital, said: ''Most people, to get in front of a venture capitalist, need to have a connection or be a Stanford graduate. Our investors are not going to be all over you for a balance sheet or your exit strategy. They're looking for something that suits their interest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these sites are gathering places for investors who want a stake in companies, while others are for people who want to lend money. Whatever success they may realize, they are not expected to replace traditional venture capital or angel investing anytime soon. And whether the sites will take hold or which kind will win out is uncertain, for all of their anecdotal success stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone has a slightly different take on things,'' said Adeo Ressi, a serial entrepreneur who started TheFunded.com, a Web site where start-up chief executives can discuss investors and match them with other entrepreneurs. ''It's not clear who the winner will be or even what the right approach is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal issues loom on several fronts. Companies must be cautious when offering investments to the public, and they have to be careful not to act as brokers, which are highly regulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies' approaches vary widely. RaiseCapital and others try to arrange equity investments in businesses. Prosper, Zopa, Lending Club and others bring together would-be lenders with small-business borrowers. Ideablob, an outgrowth of Advanta, which issues small-business credit cards, and Cambrian House, a Canadian company, both allow potential investors to vote on ideas and help shape businesses. SellaBand, a Dutch company, helps musicians get financial backing from fans online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still other companies, like TheFunded and YouNoodle, are trying to build social networks in the entrepreneurial community, in the manner of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or LinkedIn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How the companies expect to make money also varies. Some, particularly lending firms, earn a commission on each transaction. Others rely on premium services, sponsorships or vendors that pay for access to their sites' users.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents compare the new companies to blogging, which allows the general public to publish online. The new financing companies hope to allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to bypass the limited-access corridors along Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road, where venture capitalists decide which start-ups get money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People need a platform like this as an extra measure to obtain funding,'' said Mr. Bertsch, the president of RaiseCapital. ''In some cases, it's a company's last means of survival.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bertsch said inquiries from new visitors to the site had jumped 21 percent in one month recently, to nearly 8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When someone seeks a loan on Prosper, the site's participating lenders ''decide who and what get funded, rather than an elite group of bankers,'' said Chris Larsen, Prosper's founder and chief executive. At Prosper, based in San Francisco, applicants state why they want a loan -- to start a business, pay down credit card debt, buy a house, pay for school -- and how much they want, as well as the interest rate they hope to pay. Prosper runs a credit check and publishes the rating, and members can bid to participate in the loan, as if it were an item for sale on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system worked perfectly for Marc Matthias and Benny Rivera, who needed $25,000 in April to start Diverse Desserts, a cake- and dessert-design company based in Manhattan. They needed money quickly, and they had taken out all the conventional loans they could, Mr. Matthias said. At Prosper, they received their loan in a week, at 11.5 percent interest, from more than 400 lenders who put up $50 to $500 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosper has made more than 27,000 loans, totaling $170 million, since Nov. 1, 2005. Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry publication, said Prosper's pace of about $100 million in loans this year was ''a decent start, but that's 20 houses in Los Angeles. It's not a lot. It could be the tip of the iceberg; it's hard to know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crucial question, Mr. Bruene said, is how much regulation the government will impose on both the lending and the financing sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Kornfield, a lawyer at <span class="companylink">Fenwick &amp; West</span> in San Francisco who advises YouNoodle, said private companies needed to be careful about any form of general advertising regarding the sale of their securities, including the solicitation of investments online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Private companies are not supposed to advertise the sale of their securities,'' he said. He added: ''Investors can figure out what companies are doing on Web sites like YouNoodle, and then they can talk offline. But to go out and say, Here I am, invest in me, that's not a smart idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bertsch, the president of RaiseCapital, said confidently, ''The government does not monitor transactions between private individual investors and private business opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the key to success may be whether a company can get attention and attract the interest of investors, then continue the ensuing dialogue in a private forum, similar to the dating services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manoj Duggirala, 23, was pursuing a master's degree in material science and engineering at Stanford when he signed up on YouNoodle because he had an idea for a business, but no connections. Through YouNoodle, he found an investor, Jan Leeman. After a courtship of several months, Mr. Leeman invested $70,000 in Mr. Duggirala's company, GiveandTake, an online shopping firm that has not yet opened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What is appealing about YouNoodle to me is the university connection,'' said Mr. Leeman, an entrepreneur turned angel investor. ''There are at least half a dozen stories of two grad students from Stanford starting something that turns into something wonderful.'' Even though he attended Stanford and lives near the campus, ''it's difficult to get access to what the students are doing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At YouNoodle, Mr. Goodson said that, according to the National Venture Capital Association, $30.5 billion in venture capital was invested in 2007, and the University of New Hampshire has estimated that angel investors put in another $26 billion. ''That's a colossal amount, and it's nearly all done without the use of technology,'' he said. ''People are still sitting down face to face and giving each other pitches. That's a lot to be distributed without a more intelligent use of technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One YouNoodle investor is Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal (now owned by <span class="companylink">eBay</span>) and a managing partner of the Founders Fund venture firm. ''There's something strange about venture capital'' operating much as it did in the 19th century, he said, ''when it's investing in all of these 21st century technologies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheftel, at eAssay, was running a wholesale jewelry business in New York, R. Sulimani, when the economy began to sour. People were selling their ''broken, old, outdated jewelry'' to raise cash, he said, and he knew he and his partner could buy it, refine it into gold bars and sell it for a small profit -- if they could expand. But without the option of a bank loan, he ''decided to try out RaiseCapital,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called a few prospective lenders he had met on the company's site; one of them was Mr. Turo, managing partner of Growthink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Turo said he was drawn to RaiseCapital as a way of looking beyond Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. One Growthink investor had already asked Mr. Turo about opportunities in jewelry, and within a few weeks Mr. Turo had provided Mr. Sheftel with half a million dollars. Mr. Sheftel was then able to increase his revenue to $250,000 to $300,000 a week from an average of $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two have still not met in person; Mr. Turo said that for an investment this size, and the modest risk involved, a meeting was not necessary.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Christine Bierman, a small-business owner, has been to the Rose Garden and met President Bush. She has received awards from the federal government for how she runs her company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after 28 years in business, Ms. Bierman says, she has yet to win a six-figure federal contract that would catapult her company, a distributor of industrial safety supplies based in St. Louis, into the higher-earning ranks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she is not alone in her frustration. Last year, female small-business owners were awarded only 3.4 percent of annual federal contracts -- even though the latest statistics show women own almost half, or 10.1 million, of small businesses nationwide, and generate about $2 trillion in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Women have spent years trying to open up the system of awarding government contracts. The Women's Business Ownership Act, which laid the groundwork for women to participate in government contracting, is now 20 years old, yet women are still getting only a sliver of the contracting pie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, Congress directed that female small-business owners receive 5 percent of federal contracts each year, now estimated to total $435 billion. But putting that mandate into effect has been a continual battle between lawmakers and the Bush administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the Small Business Administration posted the final version of the rule meant to deal with Congress's order. The rule said the 5 percent set-aside covers contracts in 31 industries, an increase from the agency's original proposal to include only four industries, which Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the ranking Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee, called a ''sham proposal.'' Still, the new number represented less than a third of the 140 industries eligible for government contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Snowe was among the 16 female senators to write to S.B.A. last week to urge a better remedy for the shortfall in contracting opportunities for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push for more contracts for female-owned businesses comes as increasing numbers of women are running their own companies and looking for ways to expand. Many women, including Ms. Bierman, argue that a lack of defined guidelines for contracts for female-owned businesses -- along with complacency, inertia or just the inconvenience of switching suppliers -- have reduced the opportunities for women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've knocked on doors for 20 years,'' said Ms. Bierman, whose company, Colt Safety, sells products including safety glasses, masks and respirators. ''But procurement is a confusing and time-consuming maze that's so difficult to get through.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organizations like Women Impacting Public Policy, a bipartisan group representing about 500,000 businesses owned by women, have started programs to help women navigate the complicated contracting system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Federal government contracts are an enormous opportunity for women to help increase their revenues by billions each year,'' said Barbara Kasoff, president and chief executive of the group. ''Right now only 67,000 women-owned businesses are registered with the government, which is less than a quarter of the total number.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her group's program, called Give Me 5, started with Open, the small-business service of <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. Give Me 5 provides a comprehensive brochure, seminars, events and online education to women business owners on how to register, qualify and identify their areas of expertise for federal government contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Women's Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Women Business Owners also offer assistance. And last May, the S.B.A. began running an online discussion and offering an online course to encourage women -- more than 8,000 signed up -- and other groups to participate in the contracting process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many women remain flummoxed by the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurie Simon, chief executive of Ombrella Consulting in Seattle, which helps companies like <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> introduce new products and systems, said she was ready to compete with big companies for contracts but was not sure how to go about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've taken the first step -- registering on the C.C.R.,'' Ms. Simon said, referring to the government's Central Contractor Registration database, which requires information like the company's taxpayer identification number from the Internal Revenue Service and determines the firm's areas of expertise under a system of six-digit codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Give Me 5 program offers a checklist with all the registry's requirements so that small businesses can assemble all the financial data needed to complete the process more smoothly and rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Schnack, president of Mary Schnack Media Services in Sedona, Ariz., enrolled in an early version of the Give Me 5 program and said it pushed her to ''get my financial house in order.'' That made registering easy because she already had obtained items like her company's unique identifying number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet. And now she is moving on to search for subcontracting opportunities for her public speaking and media training service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, I had looked at federal contracting, but I felt my business was so small that I wondered what was the point?'' she said. ''I could spend the same amount of money on business I really had a chance to get.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last five years, she said, she has been looking harder at government contracts as a way to expand her business. When she meets other female business owners, she said, ''We all talk about how difficult it is to track down what's available and to know exactly who you are competing against.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schnack recently sat down with Ann Sullivan, head of government relations for Women Impacting Public Policy. Ms. Sullivan helped her figure out which government codes applied to her business, who her competitors were and how to go about combing through fedbizopps.gov and other online sources to find contracts that she could realistically bid for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Female business owners said one of the stickier points in the contracting process was figuring out whether to be certified, which means accumulating certain detailed financial information and dealing with an on-site visit from the certifying agency. Groups like the United States Women's Chamber of Commerce certify female-owned businesses. The National Association of Women Business Owners plans to start a certification service with the Women's Business Enterprise National Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's central contractor registry allows small-business owners to certify themselves, but some have raised questions about whether all such entries are legitimate. The women's chamber of commerce group issued a report last week that said 27 of the 50 firms owned by women listed as the top recipients of government contracts had male chief executive officers. Margot Dorfman, the chief executive of the women's chamber, said that finding undercut the credibility of the self-certification program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key, Ms. Kasoff and others say, is for Congress to pass new legislation specifying firm guidelines for federal government contract awards to firms owned by women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the area for growth, and we need to understand it,'' said Ms. Kasoff who said that in the next year, the new Give Me 5 program was seeking to double, to nearly 150,000, the number of women registered as eligible for government contracts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Oct. 2 about the difficulty many businesses are having in procuring credit quoted incorrectly from a comment by Thomas N. Hund, chief financial officer of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, about the company's borrowing strategy. He said, ''We will continue to borrow to fund expansion'' -- not to fund ''maintenance,'' which is financed from cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Oct 17 2008 </p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some small companies say they are no longer able to get loans from newly cautious banks as credit tightens across the country, and even those who do qualify are increasingly reluctant to borrow and expand, fearful of overextending themselves in the midst of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Petrucci, whose small factory near Chicago makes metal molds that other manufacturers buy to form plastic parts, says his bank recently offered him an additional loan. Though orders for his molds are still plentiful, Mr. Petrucci says he will borrow only to upgrade existing machinery, not to expand.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are bracing for the downturn that is coming,'' Mr. Petrucci said. ''It is coming; there is no question about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Snyder, another businessman, is more optimistic, but his bank refused two weeks ago to grant another loan to his fledgling medical supply company near Denver. So he turned to a commercial lender, which has offered credit -- at 30 percent a year. Mr. Snyder does not want to borrow much at that rate. ''We desperately need more capital to grow our sales,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small businesses in America -- the 27 million companies employing fewer than 500 people and in most cases fewer than 20 people -- account for half of the nation's output. A downward swing, whether caused by expensive borrowing or pessimism, could weaken the economy and shrink employment. Small businesses employ 40 percent of the work force, the Census Bureau reports, and they outpace large companies in generating new jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are sitting on their hands,'' said Chad Moutray, chief economist of the Small Business Administration. ''Either they can't get the capital or they don't want the capital. They read what is happening, and frankly they are scared.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the current turmoil in the credit markets, big established businesses generally have far greater access to credit than their smaller cousins. For borrowing, small businesses often rely on banks, credit cards and small-business loans. Big businesses have substantial bank lines of credit that they can draw down as needed if they have trouble issuing new debt, usually a less expensive option. While the markets remain cool to financial companies and those with any hint of debt problems, many corporations have been able to sustain their financing, often by selling commercial paper, a form of short-term financing, albeit at higher rates than a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, a giant freight line with 40,000 employees and $20 billion in annual revenue, the biggest concern is the rising cost of all its credit, said Thomas N. Hund, the chief financial officer. ''We will continue to borrow to fund maintenance,'' Mr. Hund said, ''and if we saw growth in the economy next year, we would have an appetite for a greater expansion plan. But we don't see growth, and we are going to be extremely cautious in our investments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of bracing for harder times is evident in little ways, at companies large and small. George Wendt, the owner of Chicago Metal Rolled Products, which forms steel into supports for stadium roofs, school gymnasiums, large canopies and the like, has reduced the steel he keeps in inventory over the last month, buying only what is immediately used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That decision, multiplied across many companies, means suppliers will make less and stockpiles will shrink. There will be less production to drive the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago Metal is saving money, and so far its customers, mainly commercial construction companies, continue to buy the curved steel supports. ''When you just watch the news, everything sounds pretty gloomy,'' said Mr. Wendt, who employs 85 people at a plant in Southwest Chicago. ''But so far our market is still relatively strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Petrucci, who owns B A Die Mold in Aurora, Ill., employing 17 people to make his metal molds, also says the financial crisis has not touched him. What is more, the banks, having shed what they consider risky borrowers, are actively selling loans to those they consider creditworthy, and that includes Mr. Petrucci's company. With $2 million in annual revenue, almost no debt and enough orders to keep busy through January, Mr. Petrucci's lenders are coming to him, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate they offer has risen to 7 percent, a percentage point more than in mid-September, but the lenders are persuasive. Mr. Petrucci says he will soon borrow $200,000 to replace an aging computer-controlled lathe and to acquire the latest in electrical cutting gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not going to increase capacity; we are buying this equipment only because we want to do things better,'' he said. ''We are gambling that this financial disaster is going to have a controlled solution, and hopefully it won't impact us too greatly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Die Mold's trial by fire came in the 2001 recession. Half of Mr. Petrucci's roughly 140 competitors in the Chicago area went under, and Die Mold's staff shrank to 17, the present number, from 28. Orders picked up by middecade, but Mr. Petrucci, a mechanical engineer who founded Die Mold in 1968, says he resisted the temptation to expand his operation to its former size and risk going under in the next downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would have to be very severe to hurt us now,'' he said, adding, for example, that his automated grinding machines operate unattended at night, and if orders were to shrink substantially, he would turn off the machines overnight as a first step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superior Medical Supply, which Mr. Snyder, who is 30, and two relatives founded in 2004, buys all sorts of medical equipment and supplies from manufacturers, and resells them to nursing and ambulatory care facilities, private doctors and surgical centers. The customers normally pay within 60 days, Mr. Snyder said, but he must pay his suppliers in 30, which means he needs credit to bridge the gap -- and more so than ever as sales rise toward the $6 million mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on, a community bank gave Superior a $100,000 line of credit. Last year it raised that to $175,000. But when Mr. Snyder sought another increase late last month, he was turned down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are being told that the company does not appear strong enough to take on additional financing,'' Mr. Snyder said. To qualify for more credit, he said, Superior would have to increase the $500,000 the partners now have invested in their company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they turned to the Liquid Capital Corporation, which lends against ''receivables.'' That means Superior gives Liquid Capital the right to collect the money owed by Superior's customers, and Superior, in return, gets a line of credit. Mr. Snyder would like to draw down $240,000 to keep his company's expansion on track, and Liquid Capital says it is ready to lend that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Snyder is reluctant to borrow so much, at 30 percent annual interest, so he will draw down only $150,000. ''We don't want to expand at a rate that causes instability for our company, and borrowing $240,000 at 30 percent would do that,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing reluctance by conventional banks to lend is reflected in Liquid Capital's loan activity, which has increased 40 percent since August, to $200 million, the company says. The National Federation of Independent Business, in its monthly survey of 600 members, found in August that 10 percent were having more difficulty getting bank loans than three months earlier. That was the highest level since the 1990-91 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In late summer, conditions did get tougher,'' said William Dennis Jr., the federation's director of research. ''Our members are nervous about going to their banks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are also nervous about their sales. Michael Frome, 40, a partner in Fromeco Scale Avionics, says they are way off. He and a partner lease space in a hangar in Sandy, Ore., where they and three employees build parts for remote-controlled model airplanes -- not the balsa wood variety, but steel planes with wing spans up to 10 feet. Hobbyists buy them for $5,000 to $10,000 and often race them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month ago, Mr. Frome realized that the hobbyists, most of them men over 50 with six-figure incomes, had all but stopped buying the planes and replacement parts -- including a new electronic device, developed by Fromeco, that logs flight data. Sales plummeted from a $1 million annual rate to half that level, and they are still falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Frome attributes the sudden drop-off to the sophistication of the hobbyists, whom he describes as conversant with Wall Street, investors themselves and shocked more than most by the current debacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think my customers are quickly reducing their discretionary spending to near zero and squirreling away money,'' Mr. Frome said. ''Fear and uncertainty grip them.''</p>

While other states are laying off workers and cutting programs, Wyoming has enjoyed billions of dollars in surpluses in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a sort of relaxed composure here that other towns in America are not enjoying as the race for president enters its final chapter. Many voters here seem to agree: whoever wins is not likely to stand in the way of Wyoming and its natural gas fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have the opposite economy of the rest of the United States,'' said Steve Aaron, who was eating dinner at the Coyote Creek steak house across the street from the Astro Lounge. Mr. Aaron works in the court system and is a part-time minister. ''But we still wonder and worry about what's going on around the rest of the country,'' he said, ''even though people in the oil fields are making more money than they ever have in their lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fortunes here stem from the state's enormous supply of natural gas -- its reserves are second only to Texas -- and its role in supplying not only a demanding domestic market but other nations as well. Wyoming, the home state of Vice President Dick Cheney, has benefited from the Bush administration's energy policies, which opened up land for natural gas drilling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men making $15 an hour five years ago now take in as much as $26, and it all makes for very deep pockets for the workforce, much of it drawn from out of state. There is not very much to do in this town but work, and that is enough for most people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was drawn here for economic reasons,'' said Colt Felmlee, 24, who was interviewed at the steak house. Mr. Felmlee, a foreman for an oil fields service company, moved here from Montana, where the wages are not as high. ''I don't find it hard to relate to the rest of the country's problems because I've been there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Felmlee said he believed Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, was the candidate who most supported his industry. ''I think with him in office I would continue to do well,'' he said. ''I think in general the oil industry supports McCain. Not many people would take a strong opposition to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other oil workers said they supported Mr. McCain as well, but others said they were for Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think he'll be a stronger leader,'' said Cory Rock, as he sucked on a cigar at the strip club. But while the state's governor, Dave Freudenthal, is a Democrat, this mostly Republican state is almost certainly in Mr. McCain's column.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the industries that serve oil workers -- steak houses, title brokers and bars -- have done well in the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I find it odd that we are so for finding alternative sources of energy when this is where the money is,'' said Meesa, a stripper in the club who came from Idaho and asked to be identified by only her stage name. She makes about $500 a night. ''The guys here are paid hand over fist for extremely hard labor,'' she said, ''and there is no where to spend it here but on us.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THESE may not be the best of times to start or run a small business, but Christopher Hazlett's struggle to hang tough through one crisis after another may hold lessons for the legions of entrepreneurs caught between a stumbling economy and crippling credit squeeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, his upbeat attitude should offer them solace, and maybe even a bit of inspiration.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a rough year for Mr. Hazlett, founder and president of Integrate Consulting L.L.C., a software design firm in Hoboken, N.J. First, during the market turmoil last January, <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span>, <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> and almost all his other clients walked away from their contracts in just two weeks. His company's revenue projections for 2008 fell from six figures to close to zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, he spent a disheartening four months trying to find new business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admitting defeat, he made a big gamble to save his company by switching from his comfortable perch of doing software design for Fortune 100 companies to the uncharted territory of developing a Web product for a market that includes churches and synagogues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His timing is not optimal. He is introducing a software program called Event Clipboard on Friday in the midst of the American financial system's current nervous breakdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Mr. Hazlett, 31 years old, nervous?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of all, I feel exuberant,'' he said. ''I wake up in the morning saying, 'Yes! I wonder what's going to happen today?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It helps that the entrepreneurial urge is in his genes. He formed a theater group in college and made money creating publicity posters and Web sites. Though he weighed a career in acting or the Navy, ''I always knew I wanted to start my own company and create something from nothing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In jobs after college as a fund-raiser and later as a marketer for a couple of architectural firms, he said, ''I got bitten by the bug to make software to make it easier to do things.'' Once, he said, for example, he redesigned an operational system that allowed his employer to create photo portfolios for clients in five minutes instead of eight hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he also inherited his father's fierce work ethic. He started Integrate in June 2005 while simultaneously studying for a master's degree in communications at Rutgers University and holding down a part-time job as a data analyst at <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, he exhibited that tell-tale trait of the entrepreneur, boundless self-confidence. After graduating in December 2005, with hardly any savings, he threw himself full-time into Integrate, with <span class="companylink">Johnson &amp; Johnson</span> as his first big customer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not that I had any huge background in computer science,'' he says. ''I just knew what I could do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had already learned from a couple of mistakes in his start-up's early stages. The first was creating a bar code system to manage inventory for a machine shop. The problem was that the owners did not show much interest in it. The lesson, from that, he said, was, ''If people aren't going to use it, don't make it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second was signing a lopsided contract with a client. The lesson there, he said, was to find a good lawyer and make sure you know exactly what you are getting into when you enter into an agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, with all his energies centered on Integrate, he prospered. He signed a big contract with <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> and a few smaller deals. He hired an assistant, who, like him, worked out of her home. The money rolled in -- in the low six figures in 2006 and again in 2007, with phone bills his biggest expense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while all this was happening, Mr. Hazlett was also committing a classic blunder of the fledgling entrepreneur: putting his eggs in too few baskets. He said his gut instinct warned him of the danger, but after landing a big job with yet another big corporation last November, he stopped worrying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, it all fell apart. ''In early January, we had 12 months of work in the pipeline,'' Mr. Hazlett said. ''But in just two weeks, all our active clients backed out of their contracts. We went from euphoria to fear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a futile search for new customers, he decided to develop a new product, event-planning software for small and medium-size organizations. Using the open-source Web framework Ruby on Rails, he spent six months writing and fine-tuning Event Clipboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a lot of faith in it, in my gut, based on my research,'' he said. ''We fill a niche that didn't exist,'' which he defines as groups within large corporations, nonprofits, including houses of worship, as well as small and medium-size businesses. Smaller organizations can subscribe to a personal account, which costs $20 a month, while the most advanced version sells for $160.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Mr. Hazlett said, he has recruited nearly 50 beta testers, ''and their reaction is very positive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day of reckoning approaches. But he said that the road he had traveled so far had hardened him for whatever lies ahead. These are among the other lessons for running a business that he has absorbed over the past year, he said:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be frugal. Mr. Hazlett never sought outside financing, and has no debt. In Integrate's heyday, he thought about renting an office, but concluded there was no compelling reason to do so. He cut his salary last year, and even so, puts much of it into his personal savings account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Switch to a new product or service if the one you are marketing is not selling. ''I saw that we could only do one of two things: change or close our doors for good,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be patient. ''It takes time to get it right,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for opportunity in tough economic times. It was corporate cost-cutting that hurt him last year, he says, and so he is marketing Event Clipboard as a tool for the budget-conscious to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm hoping that by the end of 2009 we'll have 250 accounts,'' he said. ''I think it's going to go.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Small Business Administration, assessing the government's success in awarding contracts to small businesses, said Wednesday that $83.2 billion went to those companies in the last fiscal year, a record amount. And it said that the government was close to complying with a law requiring that nearly a quarter of federal contracts go to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics quickly responded that the figures failed to reflect the full picture of federal contracting.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They argued that small businesses were still not getting their fair share of government contracts. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine and the ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, was among the critics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As small businesses represent 99 percent of all firms nationwide and will be vital in leading economic recovery effort,'' she said, ''it is crucial that these enterprises receive every job-creating and capital-generating opportunity in the federal contracting marketplace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A.'s lack of effective oversight, she said, has been ''indefensible.'' Only three of the 24 government agencies met all their contracting goals for five categories of small businesses, including service-disabled veterans and women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, the New York Democrat who heads the House Small Business Committee, questioned the accuracy of the contracting figures and said, ''Small firms lost out in nearly $4 billion in opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency's acting administrator, Santanu K. Baruah, who began the job in August, emphasized that the S.B.A. relied mostly on information provided by the agencies like the Defense Department, which actually award the contracts and track them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baruah noted that the S.B.A. had made an effort to ''scrub the data'' of flawed coding and other problems that have led to large companies being listed as small businesses. The agency adopted new rules, as of July 1, 2007, that require more frequent certification to keep corporate subsidiaries from masquerading as small firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baruah conceded that some $5 billion in contracts had been miscoded as having been awarded to small businesses, a figure reported Wednesday in The Washington Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, he noted that ''$5 billion represents a 6 percent error rate,'' a figure which he defended as ''within the realm of reasonable, although that does not mean we should excuse errors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.B.A.'s statistical scorecard was started last year to measure governmentwide compliance with the Small Business Reauthorization Act. The 1997 law requires the government to award 23 percent of federal contracts to small businesses, which are defined in several ways, including employing fewer than 500 workers. The S.B.A.'s scorecard said 22 percent had been awarded.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Silicon Valley has always been a land of big, bold dreams. In the first Internet boom its start-ups either grew fast or died trying, sometimes spectacularly. The casualties of the bust, like Pets.com and Webvan, became legendary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this downturn, say investors and entrepreneurs, start-ups are adopting a strategy that they hope will let them hang on instead of flame out.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To preserve cash, many tech start-ups are rushing to lay off employees and cut expenses. They are shelving their dreams of <span class="companylink">Google</span>-size riches and getting small, humble and thrifty, all with the more modest goal of surviving the coming economic winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, an unprofitable Internet start-up like Zivity, a social site that revolves around photos of models, might have turned into just another dot-bomb. Though it has paltry revenues and just 20,000 registered users, the company pays only $8,000 a month to rent its offices in San Francisco and has received $8 million from investors. This month it laid off 8 of its 22 employees -- saving enough money to stay alive through 2011 and survive even a prolonged recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we have a valuable product,'' said Cyan Banister, Zivity's co-founder. ''We should be able to weather the storm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in normal economic times, a majority of start-ups fail. But the same factors that have made it so easy to create Web 2.0-style start-ups -- low fixed costs, access to inexpensive overseas programmers and cheap ways to advertise online -- also make it relatively easy for even faltering companies to cut back their operations to the bare minimum and hang on through a slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web start-ups ''don't fail in the same way they used to fail,'' said Brad Burnham, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, adding that the previous generation of Internet companies lived hard and died young. Knowing when to pull the plug on the current crop of more frugal companies is now ''different, more subtle, more problematic,'' he said. ''They don't run into a wall.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Web companies in this new generation are so efficient with capital that venture capitalists ''may not have the plug in our hand,'' Mr. Burnham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only certainty in Silicon Valley is that survival is quickly becoming more challenging. The growth in online display advertising, which helps fuel the new Internet ecosystem, is declining. Venture capitalists and other investors in start-ups, like hedge funds, are cutting back. The market for initial public offerings remains closed and potential acquirers -- <span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> and the rest -- are deep in their own problems. Many entrepreneurs and deal makers agree that a shake-out is indeed coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Venture capitalists have begun preaching frugality, urging the start-ups they have invested in to cut costs and get profitable. Their advice shares themes: cut employees, do not count on raising more money and move quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrepreneurs appear to be listening. AdBrite, an online advertising network in San Francisco that raised $35 million in venture capital, recently laid off one-third of its staff, or 40 employees, to get to profitability next year. The company's chief executive, Iggy Fanlo, ran the e-commerce site Shopping.com during the first dot-com bust, and he said he recalled how wave after wave of layoffs sank morale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had gone through this before and we had death by a thousand cuts,'' Mr. Fanlo said. ''I wanted to credibly look people in the eye this time and say we are profitable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day seems to bring a new round of layoffs. In the last two weeks, the music site Imeem, the social search site Mahalo, the visual search engine Searchme, the real estate site Zillow, the Internet radio site Pandora and the social network Hi5 all cut as much as a quarter of their employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many entrepreneurs, the lone goal has become survival. At Seesmic, a video blogging service, the day of reckoning -- when it runs out of the $6 million it raised in May -- will come in three years. To make the money last, Loic Le Meur, the chief executive, recently laid off seven employees, or one-third of his staff, and cut all projects not directly related to the video service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I can't make this work in three years it will be a failure,'' Mr. Le Meur said. ''If I can and I get through this, it will be much stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even companies with less than stellar track records and revenues say they can live through a protracted slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lala, a music site based in Palo Alto, Calif., has scrapped two music services and recently began a third site in conjunction with the major labels. The company raised $35 million three years ago and, thanks to financial prudence, has $20 million in the bank. It recently delayed plans to double its staff and it put its excess office space up for sublet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lala's founder, Bill Nguyen, expressed a measure of relief at the chill in the Valley. ''This whole economic crisis allows me not to have to grow,'' he said. ''I view this as a free hall pass.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wholesale resetting of expectations might be the biggest change to settle over Silicon Valley. Instead of aiming for blockbuster public offerings or market-shaking acquisitions, most entrepreneurs now just want to endure. But if not enough people use these start-ups' services and revenue does not grow fast enough to attract potential acquirers, mere survival may not look so good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Faraday Media, a Palo Alto start-up that is trying to create a personalized version of the Internet for its users, there is no revenue, no office space (the five employees work from their homes) and little chance of raising any capital from the newly miserly angel investors who would otherwise support a start-up of its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Saad, Faraday Media's founder, said the company saw no reason to give up.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If these skeletal start-ups do succumb to the downturn, firms like Sherwood Partners, which specializes in bankruptcy consulting and shutting down companies, will be waiting. Sherwood Partners has not yet had the kind of activity it witnessed during the last bust, but Martin D. Pichinson, a partner at the company, is preparing for a burst of new business as many start-ups acknowledge that just because they can survive does not mean they should.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Failing start-ups ''are already out there, and we are starting to close some of them, when investors say it needs to be done,'' Mr. Pichinson said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley are still shell-shocked from the dot-com collapse, and the latest economic crisis is bringing back memories of the wave of failed start-ups. This time, they have vowed to act quickly to avoid making the same mistakes again. At a ''crisis roundtable'' hosted by VentureBeat on Wednesday on how to manage start-ups during a recession, venture capitalists and start-up founders discussed how start-ups can survive and what they learned the last time around.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- The plight of American small-business owners has become a theme in the presidential election. But if small-business owners in the United States think they have it bad, they should talk to John Banwell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Banwell owns a cleaning business in Weymouth, a seaside town in southern England. He recently contacted his bank to renew his $:20,000 overdraft -- a $31,800 short-term line of credit -- only to learn the interest rate had almost doubled.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Banwell tried to tell the manager of his HSBC Bank branch that he needed the money to pay his four employees and his bills while he waited for customers to pay him. He received a written apology, saying there was nothing the bank could do about his rate, which had risen to 7 percent above prime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Banwell was able to borrow the money from a friend instead, but that did not solve his long-term problem: how to keep his business alive as credit tightens in the middle of an economic downturn. ''Fuel and material costs have gone up and we'll have to increase our prices, but I'm afraid it may erode sales,'' Mr. Banwell said. ''Money definitely should be made available where needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic downturn is making life tougher for businesses of all sizes. But Britain, famously called ''a nation of shopkeepers,'' has a special place in its heart for small business. And Mr. Banwell's experience is at the heart of a battle that has erupted between representatives of small businesses and the government over how much help small firms should receive as the country enters its first recession in 17 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backed by a strong business lobby, the opposition Conservative Party and the nation's two biggest tabloid newspapers, small businesses are demanding cheaper credit and tax breaks after a multibillion-pound government bank bailout failed to immediately free up credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though small businesses account for more than half of Britain's gross domestic product and employ more than 13 million, their plea is controversial. They face, arguably, the same problems of higher borrowing costs and declining consumer spending that afflict larger rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts said smaller businesses were more vulnerable to a downturn because they depended more on financing. ''A large company has more options to raise money,'' said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities in London. But others said smaller firms were actually at an advantage because they were more flexible and could adapt better to slowing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be true, but small businesses say they are feeling the pinch as banks introduce charges for processing overdraft applications, increase their fees for managing accounts or request additional collateral for loans, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes are a result of higher interbank lending rates, a deteriorating economic outlook and the banks' more conservative attitude toward risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British government tried to free up credit by making its bailout of <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>, <span class="companylink">Lloyds TSB</span> and <span class="companylink">HBOS</span> this month dependent on the banks' returning to ''2007 levels'' of lending to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, met with executives of other mayor British banks last week to persuade them to reduce borrowing costs for smaller businesses. Instead of freeing up lending, the entreaties led to criticism by some investors that the government was repeating the mistake it made during the boom: encouraging borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Businesses are anticipating banks will be supportive, reflecting the support they have received themselves,'' Neill Thomas, head of debt advisory at KPMG in London, said. But ''the reality for companies is the tap remains blocked. We expect only a trickle of liquidity to return to debt markets in the period through to Christmas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be bad news for many of Britain's 4.7 million small businesses, and it would infuriate those that helped turn small businesses from net borrowers to net depositors over the last 17 years. Smaller companies now keep $:1.48 billion with their banks, making them one of the biggest group of depositors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them is William N. Mullings, who runs a small jewelry store in London founded by his family in 1798. He is upset that the government bailed out the banks, which are now still reluctant to lend. ''If you are running a business, any business, you should be able to do so without the help of the government,'' Mr. Mullings said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher borrowing costs are not the only problem for smaller businesses. They also struggle as customers increasingly fall behind with payments, sometimes up to several months. Late payments can be a matter of life and death for smaller businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue has started to threaten the Labor Party's traditionally cozy relationship with small business and has moved small businesses into the center of a lively political debate about economic competence between Britain's two major parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is keen to be seen as a supporter of small businesses because they are perceived as ''struggling, small and hard-working,'' said Robert A. Blackburn, professor of small-business studies at Kingston University in London. ''There are a lot of votes in small businesses and there is a realization that this is quite a powerful group of people,'' said Mr. Blackburn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also widely believed that it will be small businesses that will lead Britain out of recession. ''People running Britain's small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,'' the government's secretary for business, Peter Mandelson, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popularity of Prime Minister Gordon Brown has already taken a hit because many voters blame him for creating the borrowing-and-spending boom during his time as chancellor of the Exchequer that is now pushing the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government pledged to pay its own bills to smaller businesses in no more than 10 days but David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, called for more drastic steps. In a letter to The Sun newspaper, Mr. Cameron suggested that small businesses be allowed to delay their value-added tax payments to the authorities, and be given a cut in some tax rates, to help them cope with ''the economic downturn made in Britain and designed by Gordon Brown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demands by the Federation of Small Businesses went even further, including a $:1 billion rescue fund for small businesses backed by the European Investment Bank, and a policy of publicly naming customers who pay late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his cleaning shop in the south of England, Mr. Banwell seemed to take a pragmatic approach: ''I have no problem with having to tighten the belt and don't think banks should be forced to lend more -- they are businesses too -- but the belt-tightening needs to be evenly spread.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small merchants have long chafed at the fees they must pay banks every time a customer swipes a debit or credit card. But now, with business slowing and every dollar important to their bottom line, some merchants are pushing for changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The merchants are lobbying for legislation that would compel banks to negotiate fees with them and are supporting a second measure that one of its sponsors calls a ''credit card bill of rights for merchants.'' At the same time, some merchants are seeking class-action status for litigation claiming antitrust violations by banks and the <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span> and Visa card networks.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan L. Carsrud, professor of management and entrepreneurship at Florida International University in Miami, said small-store owners have little choice but to accept the cards. ''If a mom-and-pop merchant doesn't like paying them, it can't just stop taking cards -- it would bleed customers because Americans have been socialized to use plastic,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although all merchants are facing real problems about profitability,'' he added, ''this may be a life-and-death matter for the small ones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical merchant card payment has two parts: an ''interchange fee,'' which includes an average 1.7 percent of the sale price and a flat per-transaction fee, and a separate fee that goes to the merchant's bank. Take, for example, a driver who pays for a $1,000 car repair with a credit card. The bank that issued the consumer's card receives an interchange fee of $17.10 (including a 10-cent flat fee), while the repair shop's bank gets $4, or four-tenths of 1 percent of the total sale. The repair shop pockets $978.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, merchants paid $61.56 billion in electronic payment fees, up from $48.58 billion in 2005, according to the Nilson Report, a payment systems industry newsletter. The report estimated that lenders took in 82.5 percent of those dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What merchants are getting for their money is convenience, risk management and guaranteed payment,'' said Denise Dunckel, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Visa Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various factors make every interchange fee unique. If the magnetic strip on the consumer's card does not work and a cashier has to enter its number manually, for example, a higher charge results. If the card ''rewards'' the consumer with cash back or airline miles, that, too, has a higher charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond setting fee schedules, card agreements also reach into merchants' daily operations. Merchants who take cards are supposed to accept them for purchases of any size. But to protect profits from customers who use plastic for everything -- a recent Visa television advertisement campaign humorously suggested that only social malcontents pay with cash -- some small merchants break the rule and set minimum amounts for card purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why shouldn't you be able to set a minimum?'' asked William Dennis Jr., senior research fellow for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington. ''Some of these small guys may actually lose money on a $2 or $3 credit card charge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitch Goldstone, who owns ScanMyPhotos.com, a photo-imaging venture in Irvine, Calif., and blogs about interchange fees at www.WayTooHigh.com[http://www.WayTooHigh.com], said he decided to challenge the fees in 2005 after learning that fees on reward cards were going up. ''I can barely understand them and I'm a lead plaintiff in the merchant litigation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit card industry contends that merchants are getting good value for their contribution to the rewards card programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Merchants derive significant gain from the electronic payments system, which has evolved new features such as rewards programs,'' said Trish Wexler, spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington. ''Ultimately, merchants benefit from rewards programs because people buy more when they use cards. Higher fees for rewards cards are justified because merchants and consumers both share in their expense -- but merchants want to pass their fair share to consumers, who'd be hit with higher credit costs and reduced rewards if the merchants succeed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who has sponsored one of the measures in Congress, said he planned to reintroduce a ''credit card bill of rights for merchants,'' as he calls it. ''Our American merchants are paying the world's highest interchange fees, a fast-increasing cost of business for them, with literally no protections,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The congressman said the merchants told him about their card problems when he set up tables at Vermont country stores. ''Some Vermonters who owned multiple gas stations said that to deal with rising gas prices and interchange fees, they wanted to experiment with cash-only at some and the status quo at others, but were told this would violate their card agreements,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the House Judiciary Committee, with bipartisan support, narrowly passed legislation that requires banks and merchants to negotiate interchange fees. The measure is sponsored by Representatives John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the committee, and Chris Cannon, a Utah Republican who was defeated in the summer primaries. Small banks and credit unions testified that fee reductions would take away badly needed income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth J. Clayton, director of card policy for the American Bankers Association in Washington, called the bill ''a dramatic proposal by big retailers to use political muscle to lower their costs.'' Smaller retailers, he said, ''are being put up as poster children to show how challenging it is for them. But behind the scenes are big-box stores that see an opportunity to lower their costs of participating in the electronic payments system that benefits them greatly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Carsrud said that while card fee reductions would save large merchants the most in terms of absolute dollars, small ones would gain, too, because they have few options to reduce costs. ''They can't easily raise prices now, and they may not survive if they slash payroll or marketing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Federation of Independent Business and the National Small Business Association, also based in Washington, remained neutral on the Conyers-Cannon bill and on a companion measure sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the National Small Business Association, Molly Brogan, explained in an e-mail message: ''While we recognize the significant issues surrounding the inability of small businesses to properly negotiate interchange fees -- especially with the nation's top 10 banks controlling 88 percent of credit-card receivables -- we are focused on broad credit card reform. Given our diverse membership, interchange fees impact our small businesses differently -- some members rely on credit card rewards, offered at the cost of our other members who are forced to pay for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Mann, a law professor at Columbia University and a credit specialist, said he expected that there would be ''a tremendous push in Congress in 2009 to adopt important credit card reforms'' because of the increased sensitivity to banks' lending practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, ''Merchants' card problems -- even though especially pressing for small ones -- do not top most legislators' agendas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not far from the Capitol in Washington, the owner of the Cleveland Park Valet dry cleaner, Robert Kotchenreuther, said he counted on customer relations, not legislation or litigation, to keep his card fees down. ''I hate credit cards,'' he added, ''but I'd lose too much business not taking them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kotchenreuther said he had ''quite a few customers who are very understanding and caring and pay by cash or check because they know it costs me each time I use the card machine.'' He estimated that he paid $5,000 to $6,000 in card fees each year -- money, he said, that could ''help me upgrade my 1994 van with 125,000 miles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kotchenreuther carries two cards of his own: a small-business credit card and a Upromise credit card that rewards users with college tuition dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Kotchenreuther said he could not remember the last time he used either card. ''If I go to another small merchant, I know he has to pay a fee to use his machine, and I don't like that -- I pay cash.'' Nor does he pay with cards at bigger businesses. ''If I need a hotel room or rental car,'' he said, ''I'll use a card to hold them and pay cash when I get there.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are two schools of thought on this one: One, it's a recession. No one is buying. So in order to get new customers and keep current customers happy, you lower your prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, she writes, despite the talk that deflation -- a period of declining prices -- may occur sometime in the near future, most business are facing rising costs, especially if they purchase commodities. That, she says, gives them ''every right to pass along these increases'' to their customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given recessionary pressure on one hand, and rising operating expenses on the other, Ms. Murray says she chooses raising prices. ''If people see the value in your product or service, they will keep buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE THAN HIGHER PRICES For small businesses worried that a price increase will drive away customers, Entrepreneur magazine says there is a way to gain the benefits of a price increase without actually charging more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices don't exist in a vacuum. Like the earth under your feet, a price is supported by the value the customer perceives in the product or service to which the price is attached. Thinking about price and value in this way makes it clear that this is at least a two-dimensional problem. That is, you can change the pricing and leave the value alone, or you can change the value and leave the pricing alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food companies are the perfect example of this. They often leave the price unchanged, but give you less. Coffee used to be sold in 16-ounce containers but is now sold in 13-ounce cans at the price companies used to charge for a full pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar business analogy may be to keep your prices the same, but have lower-priced people -- senior associates, instead of partners -- do the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HEDGE YOUR BETS If you are going to raise your prices, set them higher than you have to, suggests Karen E. Klein, writing on businessweek.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That way, if your customers balk, you can reduce the price increase a bit and still end up with the increase you need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's an example -- ours -- of how that might work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose you want to raise prices 8 percent. You would announce a price increase of 10 percent, knowing that if customers object, you could offer them ''special terms'' of some sort that reduces the actual increase to the 8 percent increase you want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, if no one objected, you would keep the full 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST CALL With his tongue only partly planted in his cheek, Hesh Reinfeld suggests that if you want to get more from your marketing spending, learn to hate your customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reinfeld, a small-business consultant who also writes a humor column, says that his ''success is tied to being able to serve as many clients as possible.'' But he adds, ''There are only 24 hours in a day. By analyzing my work schedule and those of my employees, I found that we spent way too much time with clients we liked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reinfeld said he found that for every hour of billable work, he and his staff spent another, nonbillable hour talking to clients they liked about their children or playing golf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people made great potential friends but terrible clients,'' he says. ''I usually lost money on each one of those consulting contracts. On the other hand, when I despised a client, I'd do the work, and then get out of his office. I didn't ask any questions about the boar head on the wall or the photo of him bicycling with the president at what looked like Camp David.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he turned a profit as a result.</p>

That was better than analysts' forecast that it would remain unchanged, but well below the survey's historical average of 27.1 points. ZEW said a government rescue package for Germany's financial sector and an economic stimulus package appeared to have helped brighten investors' outlook for the next six months.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALL eyes may be on the crumbling titans of Wall Street, but rarely has the future been so uncertain for millions of current and would-be owners of small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unfolding financial crisis and the election of Barack Obama as president are remaking the landscape of small business -- a vast, sprawling area of economic activity that has been an engine of job creation and a bulwark of employment.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small business includes a wide variety of enterprises like self-employed artists and writers; pint-sized flower shops and family roofing operations; real estate investors with dozens of rentals; and companies with hundreds of employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small businesses are particularly fragile, and they fail at a pretty high rate,'' said Leonard Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank in Washington. ''Even if they get credit, they may not have time'' to build themselves into sustainable businesses if consumer spending remains weak, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey in September of 4,200 small-business owners by MerchantCircle, a social networking Web site for small companies, four of five respondents said either that the federal bailout of financial institutions would not help them or that they were unsure whether it would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the election intensified scrutiny of Mr. Obama's tax plans. He has pledged to raise taxes on households earning more than $250,000. He has also pledged to create a $5 billion Small Business Rescue Plan, similar to the Treasury bailout, to be run through the Small Business Administration, as well as to scrap capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and provide them with a small tax credit on their health care costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While more than 35 million taxpayers report small-business income of some kind, according to the Tax Policy Center, the Small Business Administration says there are only 6 million small businesses in the United States, a definition that includes companies with 500 or fewer employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus among many leading tax policy analysts who hew to a conventional definition of small business is that few, if any, of the 6 million small-business owners would see an increase in taxes under an Obama presidency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It won't have much of an effect, if any, on them,'' Mr. Burman said. He added that only 1.4 percent of small-business owners made enough money to fall into the top two income brackets, where Mr. Obama has said he would increase taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax issues aside, the economy has many small-business owners worried. Take Jennifer Neufeld, who with her husband, Jamyang Lodoe, opened an art gallery of Tibetan and Burmese paintings and antique furnishings in Rhinebeck, N.Y., in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't tell you how many people have come in the last couple of months and said that a year or two ago they would have bought a piece of art or furniture,'' said Ms. Neufeld, who ran a profitable advertising company in Moscow for more than a decade. ''But with the current situation, they're just not buying, or they're getting something token.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neufeld said she knew of ''at least five small businesses'' in Rhinebeck, a town about 100 miles north of New York, that had closed or were on the verge of closing. ''Right now, I am way more concerned about how we're going to make money than what taxes I'm going to pay.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAUGHT in the credit vise of 2008 that is threatening their livelihoods, small-business owners are turning in droves to an age-old source of commerce: the exchange of goods and services, or barter, to hold on to their precious cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New money is not flowing to Main Street. Since October 2007, there has been a decline of almost 30 percent in loans approved for small businesses, the Small Business Administration reported.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies short on cash are often forced to let workers go, and in October alone companies with 50 or fewer workers eliminated 25,000 jobs, according to the ADP Small Business Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During recent history, we have seen these businesses adding jobs while larger-size businesses shed them,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which prepares the report. This is the first decline in small-business employment reported by ADP since November 2002, he said, and the largest percentage decline since the economy was emerging from recession in early 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, barter exchanges are working hard to sign up participants. The exchanges range from publicly traded entities like International Monetary Systems and the <span class="companylink">Itex Corporation</span> to smaller operations like U-Exchange.com. Many are reporting double-digit increases in membership, as well as a bump in transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Itex, for example, registrations jumped 36 percent in October, said Steven White, the chairman and chief executive. The exchange, founded in 1982, has more than 24,000 member businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bartering has grown with the times and is now much more than ''I'll take yours, if you take mine.'' Often, these days, multiple parties meet through online exchanges and amass credit that can be used for future transactions (more like ''you take mine and I'll take someone else's later.'') Drawing on the reach of the Internet, many exchanges include participants from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes barter so appealing during an economic crisis? Barter specialists point to three attributes. First, a member business can find new customers and use excess capacity. Second, a satisfied barter partner often refers cash-paying customers to the small business. And third, the participants can conserve hard-to-come-by cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken and Angela Lineberger, owners of the Wine Tailor winery and retail store in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., said sales would be flat this year had they not been active in the Itex exchange. Thanks to bartering, overall sales are up 8 percent, Mr. Lineberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are customers who wouldn't normally seek out their wine, Mr. Lineberger said. ''We just had a couple drive over 100 miles to buy six cases of our wine because they're Itex members,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Itex customers pay the full retail price, he added; they are not discount buyers. The Linebergers use Itex dollars they accumulate in sales to pay for pest control, electrical work, accounting and legal services. ''It's nice to move those over to Itex,'' he said, because it frees cash. They also use it for vacations and other personal transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For tax purposes, barter is treated like ordinary sales, and its value must be reported. The barter exchanges record all transactions and report them to the Internal Revenue Service. Of course, informal bartering among small companies and independent contractors has gone on for decades, and some report the revenue and pay taxes, while others prefer to operate within the underground economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bartering is estimated to generate more than $3 billion through exchanges in the United States, said Robert B. Meyer, who edits BarterNews.com, a trade publication. That does not include corporations that barter directly, he said. Official tallies are hard to come by, he said, because there are more than 250 exchanges and the systems are decentralized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of exchanges are available online, some national and some regional. Some charge membership fees and annual fees, while others do not. Often, there are transaction fees of up to 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners should do the normal due diligence when looking for an exchange, said David Wallach, president of the International Reciprocal Trade Association's global board. For references, check with people or businesses in your area that use an exchange, and before entering into a transaction, vet your potential partner with the Better Business Bureau. The association, a nonprofit group that promotes barter and trade, has a test for businesses, ''Is Barter for You?,'' on its Web site (irta.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Keogh, who runs his own construction firm, Jade Stone Construction, in Pearl River, N.Y., just completed his first barter transaction through International Monetary Systems (imsbarter.com).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The construction business has always been feast or famine,'' said Mr. Keogh, 47, a native of Dublin who has been in the New York region for 22 years. During a recent bad stretch, Mr. Keogh was scrambling to drum up new customers through advertising, <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and even roadside signs. I.M.S. Barter saw the <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> post and contacted him. After he researched the company, Mr. Keogh said, he decided to give it a try, agreeing to paint a house for $5,000 -- $1,000 in cash and $4,000 in I.M.S. trade dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dalsimer subsequently referred Mr. Keogh to two new customers. One of them will provide Mr. Keogh's next project, painting a two-bedroom apartment in Somers, N.Y., in another part-cash, part-barter arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to be careful how much you trade,'' he said, because you don't want your business to become dominated by bartering. And each side of a transaction carries that 6 percent fee, cutting into profit. Experts recommend that a business use barter for no more than 5 to 15 percent of sales to avoid crowding out cash business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many barter exchanges offer credit to members who have been turned away by lenders in the real economy; in its recent credit-line review in October, International Monetary Systems issued $2.7 million in trade credit to its network of 18,000 businesses, adding to an existing $55 million in established credit lines, said Krista Vardabash, its director of marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We base our credit on the products and services that the member businesses have to offer, not on their cash accounts or how they look on paper,'' said Donald Mardak, the chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, bartering is not mainstream, said John C. Moore, a founder of U-Exchange.com. Still, traffic at the site, which is run by Mr. Moore and his co-founder, Barb Di Renzo, has spiked 70 percent this fall, he said, with an influx of participants from Spain, South Africa, Britain and the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new member at U-Exchange is R House Construction, owned by Rich Rowley of Tacoma, Wash. In a recent post on U-Exchange, he offered new home construction, remodeling, home repairs, real estate work orders, home maintenance and commercial improvements. In exchange, Mr. Rowley is looking for vacations, real estate, homes, land, dining, medical care, dental care, a boat, a motor home, groceries, gas, entertainment, a ski pass and tickets to Mariners baseball games or Seahawks football games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far he has had no takers, but he said he remained optimistic. ''We have to learn to adapt to the changing landscape,'' Mr. Rowley said. ''Part of that is bartering. The exciting thing is this is another part of the puzzle that gets us to where we're going.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife, Kathy Robinson, came up with the idea of bartering as their business dropped off, said Mr. Rowley, who usually builds two houses a year and sells them. This year, he sold only one house; the other remains empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the U-Exchange post does not work out, Mr. Rowley said, he has arranged privatelyto do renovation work on a vacation home in Ocean Shores, west of Seattle, while he and his wife stay in another beach home. ''We really like to travel,'' he said. ''We don't want to be denied that just because the economy is going south.''</p>

Employees are known as Googlers, new employees are Nooglers and gay employees are Gayglers. Now that the company has been around for a decade and employs upward of 20,000 people, another group has earned its own name: former Googlers are known as Xooglers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the Xooglers (the name is a contraction of ex-Googlers but is pronounced ''zooglers'') are young, entrepreneurial and, thanks to <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s soaring success, wealthy enough to start their own second acts. Some are starting companies in Silicon Valley and beyond, and others are helping to finance those ventures.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With investment money scarcer because of the financial crisis, many Xoogler entrepreneurs have tapped into a network of affluent and technically skilled investors -- their former co-workers, some of whom still work at <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Angel investing is slowing down a great deal,'' said Adeo Ressi, the founder of TheFunded.com, a Web site on which entrepreneurs rate Silicon Valley's venture capitalists and angel investors. ''For many, an investment by a former colleague may be the only shot they have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Vassallo, a principal at <span class="companylink">Foundation Capital</span>, a venture investment firm, said: ''My friends call it 'the <span class="companylink">Google</span> money tree.' You get some half-baked idea, you talk to five people at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, and each of them gives you $50,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xooglers believe not only in their ideas, but also in the network they have cultivated, as well as the <span class="companylink">Google</span> culture, which informs their new ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Google</span> was just a massive explosion and sucked in all this talent,'' said Avichal Garg, a former product manager at <span class="companylink">Google</span> who is now co-founder of PrepMe.com, a start-up aiming to take on the test preparation industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of these people are leaving who are relatively young and ended up with fair bit of money,'' he said. ''They didn't walk away with $20 million, but they walked away with $2 million. And now the cost of running a new company is so low that essentially <span class="companylink">Google</span> financed their start-up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garg raised a six-figure sum from former <span class="companylink">Google</span> colleagues for his business. He is now part of a network of Xooglers trying to promote tighter links among the alumni community. The group meets quarterly, and while it has attracted only about two dozen people thus far, each meeting brings new participants and draws them from farther away. Aydin Senkut, a former senior manager at <span class="companylink">Google</span> who now runs his own angel investment firm, Felicis Ventures, said Xooglers from New York and overseas came to Silicon Valley for a gathering on Nov. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>'s effort to build an entrepreneurial culture almost by definition anticipates an early exit by many workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I look at the people coming into the company, and many of them are very entrepreneurial,'' said Alan Eustace, <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s senior vice president for engineering and research. ''I believe if you come in and have that entrepreneurial track record, you will get a chance to advance that. You'll have an edge, and you'll learn an awful lot at <span class="companylink">Google</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Gianforte, chief executive of the software maker RightNow Technologies, said many people wanted to start their own businesses, but business schools did a poor job of preparing them. ''Places like <span class="companylink">Google</span>,'' he said, ''are really the best learning ground for the skills you need to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xooglers cite many lessons learned at <span class="companylink">Google</span>. ''Never take the status quo,'' Mr. Senkut said. ''And fact-based decision-making -- always rely on data. Never make an emotional decision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> imparted ''an emphasis on thinking big,'' added Elad Gil, who was a product manager at <span class="companylink">Google</span> and now has a start-up, MixerLabs. ''The ambition of the company got rubbed into the employees as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees recalled product strategy meetings in which the <span class="companylink">Google</span> founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, aggressively challenged employee proposals. Though grueling, the confrontations were never personal, they said, and always focused on the merits of the ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a start-up, you bring that same analytical approach: How do I get users? What decisions do I make?'' Mr. Gil said. ''I think a lot of Xooglers take that with them when they start their own companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says he is also trying to uphold the same high standards in hiring that he saw at <span class="companylink">Google</span>. ''It takes longer to find the right people, but when you find them, they're really exceptional,'' Mr. Gil said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Xooglers said the company also helped its employees develop self-confidence. ''I find the people at <span class="companylink">Google</span> very inspiring,'' said Anna Patterson, who left <span class="companylink">Google</span> with a colleague, Russell Power, to join Cuil, a new search engine started by her husband, Tom Costello. ''They teach you to believe in yourself and to follow through with your ideas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Singerman, a former engineer at iGoogle and now a partner at Founders Fund, a venture capital firm, cited another lesson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that <span class="companylink">Google</span> made crystal clear was release early and release often,'' he said. ''Iterate, iterate, iterate. The Web allows you to do that quickly, and <span class="companylink">Google</span> was masterful at that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bret Taylor, chief executive of FriendFeed, a start-up that lets people track what their friends are doing across various social networks, said his time as a product manager at <span class="companylink">Google</span> had taught him the importance of speed and stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s products ''runs faster, returns results and works the way you expect it to work,'' he said. If a piece of software was not working right, the developer kept at it until the flaws were worked out or the project was dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That lesson came to us very early on at <span class="companylink">Google</span>,'' said Mr. Taylor, who co-created <span class="companylink">Google</span> Maps. ''If page views were slow, that was the only thing you were allowed to work on. It's something that a lot of entrepreneurs don't value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of Mr. Taylor's first meetings at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, in 2003, he said that Mr. Page had told him, ''It's O.K. if you fail, I just want you to fail quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a big-picture level, Mr. Eustace, vice president of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, said the company promoted ''a missionary view'' of the world. ''You really do want to change the world on some dimension,'' he said. ''It's not just about money, it's about doing something you think is important. The people that leave and the people that stay share that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> does not reveal its rate of attrition, but the company says it tries to keep its employees. It still offers most engineers the fabled ''20 percent time'' -- the chance to spend one day a week working on projects that are important to them. Often, the company hires people without having a specific task for them, figuring they will come up with something worthwhile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''no matter how hard they try to promote an entrepreneurial culture, some things just can't happen at a big company, and people get frustrated and move on,'' said Alex Gould, an instructor at Stanford University and an entrepreneur and former venture capitalist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a common refrain, and often the Xooglers' only criticism. Dominic Preuss joined <span class="companylink">Google</span> in March 2004 in New York, when the company employed 1,400 people, but by the time he left in November 2007, to start FunCoop, an online distribution network for casual games (financed mostly by Xooglers), that was no longer the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was no longer a small, nimble company where everyone was trying to change the world,'' Mr. Preuss said. ''<span class="companylink">Google</span> is the most nimble, most malleable 20,000-person company out there, but it still is a 20,000-person company. A lot of the bureaucracy and politics that are inherent in a big company started to kick in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successful companies have long spawned spinoffs and start-ups. Former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> employees have started a number of ''Baby Bills,'' nicknamed for Bill Gates, in and around Seattle. But according to Tony Audino, a former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> executive who is chief executive of Conenza, which builds and manages online communities for big companies, ''it didn't happen until 15 to 20 years later,'' after the company was well-established and had built up a solid managerial core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> is rewriting the rules and accelerating the pace. Only time will tell if the Xooglers' start-ups will achieve the success of the most notable Silicon Valley alumni network, PayPal. After <span class="companylink">eBay</span> acquired PayPal, founders and employees went on to start LinkedIn, YouTube, Slide, Yelp and Founders Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Singerman, the former iGoogle engineer, is a partner at Founders Fund, which is headed by Peter Thiel, a PayPal founder. Mr. Singerman says he thinks that the <span class="companylink">Google</span> network will have the same success as PayPal's, because of the number of ''smart, driven people dedicated to making their company work, no matter what.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FriendFeed is perhaps the best example of the network in action. Bret Taylor left <span class="companylink">Google</span> with his colleague Jim Norris, and they became entrepreneurs-in-residence at Benchmark Capital, a venture capital firm. While seeking financing for FriendFeed, they pitched their idea to Paul Buchheit and Sanjeev Singh, two Xooglers-turned-angel investors, who had worked on Gmail. They were so impressed that they invested in and joined the company. FriendFeed's first $5 million came mostly from Mr. Buchheit and Mr. Singh.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST spring, Edward Ip, the owner of IUG Business Solutions, a company that sells point-of-sale systems to retailers, gave a party for about two dozen suppliers at his offices in Lower Manhattan. The event was catered -- with a twist. The caterer was a client of Mr. Ip's who was more than $10,000 behind on payments, and the job provided an opportunity for the caterer to lower his debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess that means I'll work for food,'' Mr. Ip said.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Collecting money owed is no laughing matter for small businesses, especially during this economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, the Silicon Valley company that makes accounting software for small businesses, surveyed 751 owners of businesses with fewer than 10 employees. Nearly 42 percent of the respondents said that getting paid on time was a top concern, and a third reported seeing more overdue or uncollected debts over the last year, averaging about $1,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since early fall, Mr. Ip, who is also IUG's president, has also experienced slower payments, with 20 percent of his clientele having fallen behind and owing, on average, between $2,000 and $3,000. ''We have worked with many of our clients for years,'' he said. ''It's not that they don't want to pay, but times are tough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently Mr. Ip has even helped some of the companies that owe him money to get new loans, which in turn allowed Mr. Ip to be paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcus Muniz, president of Boxes Etc., a company based in Orlando, Fla., which sells preassembled shipping containers and supplies, has also sought to be paid. Last month, about 30 percent of his 1,000 clients were 60 days behind in their payments, with the average debt about $7,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a trickle-down effect,'' said Mr. Muniz, referring to clients who had anticipated using the cartons to ship goods that in the end had no buyers. ''We are trying to negotiate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has resorted to delaying some shipments until customers make a payment. And, thanks to his business office's reminders that credit card payments are accepted, about 15 percent of his financially strapped customers now pay that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the fees Mr. Muniz must pay to credit card companies reduce his profits, he said bearing that cost was better than receiving no payment at all. And he said that credit charges allowed clients an extra 30 days to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of my clients are embarrassed,'' Mr. Muniz said, adding that they felt remorse over not being able to pay, as well as ''pride in wanting to pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this year, Yin Chang, owner of Phoenix Marketing Communications in Montclair, N.J., which focuses on technology businesses, found herself with a client owing a five-figure amount. Ms. Chang worked out a payment plan and even offered to reduce the debt further if the client sent new business her way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience led her to incorporate new terms in her standard contract, which all clients must sign. She now adds 20 percent interest to all payments that are 60 days past due, and she cuts off services to clients with bills 90 days past due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel a little safer,'' Ms. Chang said, adding that her clients had not been deterred by these new measures. ''I don't think any C.E.O. would sign a contract like that unless they felt confident they could pay.'' Her strategy has also caught on. Three of the five business owners she regularly meets with, and who are especially worried about start-up companies' ability to pay on time, have added similar clauses to their contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The minute business owners fail to recognize that by providing goods and services they become their customer's bank, they put themselves at risk for inappropriately underwriting their customers,'' said Morris Bocian, a business consultant and owner of Creative Business Planning in Livingston, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To protect itself, a company can set a policy that allows it to be paid on a continuing basis as goals are achieved, he said. Or businesses can collect payments in advance, mitigating the risk that the customer will not pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bocian cautioned, however, that a contract was only as good as a business owner's willingness to live by it. ''You put your company at risk the moment you fail to enforce the terms,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although in the last six months only a few of Mr. Bocian's clients said they had been worried about slow payments or that companies that owe them money might go bankrupt, he expects anxiety to heighten. ''Ultimately, the fear is that their receivables will become uncollectible,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When such a possibility arises, experts say, it is important to act quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Your ability to collect is greater when debt is new, because once a company is out of business there's nothing to collect,'' said Jocelyn Nager, the president of Frank, Frank, Goldstein &amp; Nager, a law firm in New York. Her company collects bad debt under a contingency arrangement; they are paid only if they collect. ''You want to be the first of all creditors to get paid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often a company that is owed money will hire a collection agency, which is legally allowed to pursue debtors by phone or in writing, Ms. Nager said. But if the agency is unsuccessful, it may subcontract the work to a law firm, which means additional fees for the client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's less costly to hire a collections lawyer directly, and it's often the more expedient move, because commercial claims are usually not paid without a lawsuit,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often getting paid comes down to how much the client needs the services of the creditor, said Ken Morrow, a certified public accountant and the owner of Bookkeeping USA, which has offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn. He recommends that his clients go to small claims court to collect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moment a company realizes its clients do not intend to pay, because they won't set a time frame for or an amount of payment, it's off to court,'' Mr. Morrow said. In most cases, he said, companies wait until the last minute and pay before the court appointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Jensen, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, said small businesses were paying more attention to back office functions, like tracking every dollar of accounts receivable. ''You need to become more organized and rigorous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ip is sticking with what works. He is planning another event this year and if necessary, he said, he will work out a catering arrangement with another food company that owes him money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to maintain good relationships and be creative with payment arrangements to show good faith, he says. What's more, Mr. Ip said, he felt strongly that even in a sluggish economy, businesses needed to keep growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being flexible with our clients helps them,'' he said. ''And it also helps us.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN before the current market meltdown, many of the 165 employees at Torch Technologies, an engineering company in Huntsville, Ala., were worried about their retirement savings. So Julia Michaux, the company's human resources manager, asked <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span>, the manager of the firm's 401(k) plan, to hold two group workshops last month to discuss financial advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, as long as the Fidelity representative was coming down from Nashville, Ms. Michaux slotted in four hours before the workshops for individual meetings with employees, 30 minutes each, to talk about any financial concerns on the employees' minds.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fidelity did not charge either Torch or the employees for these sessions because when Torch shifted its retirement accounts to Fidelity two years ago, Ms. Michaux said, the company ''negotiated some free training.'' But she said she might be willing to pay $500 in travel costs for the representative to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone would like to have a financial planner looking at what they're doing and saying, yeah, you're doing the right thing, or you ought to be doing this,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tough times like these, when small businesses have to pinch pennies, employee perks are an obvious line item for cuts. Yet companies seem to be maintaining, and even adding, this particular perk -- one-on-one, personal financial advice, similar to the kind of attention wealthy people pay thousands of dollars a year to receive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason this benefit is largely immune to cost-cutting is that companies usually do not pay extra for it. And small-business managers say the advice helps them as much as their staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does us no good to have stressed-out employees with problems outside work that affect their work or lower their productivity,'' said Garry Markle, vice president of the Spiratex Company, a plastics manufacturer in Romulus, Mich. Spiratex brings in two advisers for its 127 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Principal Financial Group</span>, a financial services firm based in Des Moines that specializes in small and medium-size businesses, says the number of individual meetings has been growing 20 percent a year since the company began holding them in 2003. <span class="companylink">Principal Financial</span> now works with 380,000 employees at 1,700 companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countless small companies and independent advisers also provide this service; typically they also administer the small business's retirement plan. They simply tack on a few extra hours to a regular visit, as Fidelity did at Torch, using that time to meet for 15 to 30 minutes with each interested employee. While the adviser may try to focus on the company's benefits menu, the discussion can range over the employee's entire financial portfolio, from budgeting to life insurance to saving for children's college tuition to estate planning -- and, these days, market panic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin S. Howard, a partner at Cherry Street Partners in Madison, Conn., who has been hired at six very small companies, says he discusses ''current market conditions and how it's affecting them and their goals.'' He also offers timeless guidance: ''Their homework assignment might be to develop a budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not charity that leads financial advisers to offer these sessions free. ''The service kind of pays for itself,'' said Luke Vandermillen, head of the advisory program at Principal. ''We tend to attract more clients as a result of this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Price, manager of the Manhattan branch of the brokerage firm Edward Jones, has been trying to reach beyond her retail clientele by offering free one-on-one meetings at small businesses -- so far, without success. Her strategy: ''The employee could decide to become a client of mine. Or perhaps they'll tell their sister or their brother, who has more specific needs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a Principal representative met last spring with the 50 employees of the Righter Company, a general contractor in Columbus, Ohio, nearly all of them ended up buying added insurance from Principal, according to Righter's president, Brad Nadolson. He admits that he was at first a bit concerned about the pitching of products by the advisers at the sessions. ''But the financial planning they do speaks for itself,'' he added. ''As long as it was low pressure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the meetings are usually during working hours, businesses must consider the cost of lost work time -- $1,000 and up, managers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many executives, the service is worth the lost work. D. Holly Lifke, vice president of human resources at Society Insurance in Fond du Lac, Wis., has not paid Principal for its annual employee meetings, which started in 2007, but she says she would be willing to pay up to $100 an hour for extra visits during this financial turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The counseling has already produced results: Over half of Society Insurance's 252 employees have sat down with Principal, and employees are now saving 8 percent of their salary, on average, up from 6 percent. ''We have employees that now feel more confident in their ability to retire and their ability to save for their children's education,'' Ms. Lifke said.</p>

Caiazzo Plumbing and Heating, which their grandfather -- Joe, naturally -- started in 1951. They do not earn anything close to $250,000 a year: Big Joe, who is 25 and handles construction, makes $17.50 an hour; Little Joe, 24, who does ''jobbing'' -- last-minute calls like boiler inspections, new water heaters, no heat and sewer stoppages -- $18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither lasted very long in community college; both learned the trade they love riding the truck, from the time they were big enough to hold a flashlight over Dad's shoulders to the high school summers they spent as apprentices. Now, though it will be years before they invest up to $10,000 in the licensure exam, they are the teachers, training younger brothers, cousins and other green Caiazzo recruits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I go home with cleaner pants now,'' said Big Joe, who was wearing a burgundy company T-shirt over jeans that, while freshly laundered, had dirt stains deep in the denim. ''I am a lucky plumber. They know I work hard, but at the same time, I know they're not going to fire me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little Joe has the dirtier job; he wears sneakers and carries his boots, so as not to muck up people's carpets. He is not worried about the economy because ''plumbing's a business that people are always going to need.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once the winter hits, pipes start freezing and people need their heat a lot more,'' he said. ''The business can go under, but you can always go out and get a job and say, 'I know this.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator John McCain may have lost the presidential election, but he succeeded in adding ''Joe the Plumber'' to the American lexicon, making a household name of Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, the Ohio journeyman whose question about taxes led Barack Obama to say he wanted to ''spread the wealth around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wurzelbacher apparently has a book deal in the works and has hired the management firm that handled country, rock and pop musicians including Grand Funk Railroad, Leon Redbone and the Gatlin Brothers. At cafepress.com, you can buy a Joe the Plumber trucker hat ($11.99), baseball jersey ($29.99) or baby bib ($7.99). In the waning days of the campaign, Republican rallies were wallpapered with ''I Am Joe the Plumber'' signs, Spartacus-like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on Halloween, 12-year-old Finlay McCracken, whose father, Todd, is president of the National Small Business Association, popped a pillow under a T-shirt that read ''Joe's plumbing,'' put a plunger through his belt loop and collected candy in an old plastic bucket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's better than a plumber?'' Mr. McCracken, of Arlington, Va., said when asked why he thought the character had so captivated the public imagination. ''A plumber is someone who, yes, has a great deal of skill to do the job, but it doesn't require a Ph.D. It's something that even an American who doesn't go to college can aspire to and be a part of the American dream, but not part of the elite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it had been Joe the Business Consultant -- because he's a small-business owner, too -- that wouldn't have worked out so well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Wurzelbacher's question concerned Mr. Obama's plan to raise taxes on people earning $250,000 a year, the median wage of the nation's 436,000 plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters in 2007 was $44,090, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mr. Wurzelbacher was talking about buying the business where he worked, and, indeed, 12 percent of all plumbers are self-employed. Broadly speaking, about three-quarters of small-business owners report business income as personal income; of these 11 million owners, about 4 or 5 percent make more than $250,000 a year, Mr. McCracken said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a 2005 survey by the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors Association -- whose president, of course, is a plumber named Joe (Schmitt, of Englewood, Ohio) -- about a quarter of its 4,000 members have less than $500,000 in annual revenue, and 29 percent have more than $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. Caiazzo has $3 million in annual revenue and 29 employees (six of them Caiazzos). It has a 4,000-square-foot warehouse on a semi-industrial four-lane stretch in central Brooklyn. It has 12 trucks -- vans, really -- and its work is roughly 30 percent new construction (<span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> are among the major corporate clients), 35 percent rehabbing (including Matt Damon's downtown loft), 25 percent ''jobbing'' and 10 percent installing fire sprinklers. Lately, the company has been busy updating <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> franchises -- for up to $15,000 each -- to accommodate the fancy French coffee drinks the chain has added to its menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm very active in the paperwork industry part of it,'' said the company president, 57-year-old Anthony Caiazzo -- the oldest son of the Original Joe and the father of Big Joe. ''I had two fights with inspectors yesterday -- I'm going to win them both. I'm on a subcommittee to the New York City buildings department. I'm the blue-collar guy who comes up and sits with all the architects and engineers and says, 'Guys, you're thick, you don't know what you're talking about.' I'm probably one of the few up there who can still clean out a sewer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''Yeah, I'm successful, but I'm not a businessman. I'm more like, 'Let's go out and make money today.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wages at Caiazzo, a nonunion shop, start at $8 an hour for, as Anthony Caiazzo put it, ''a guy who knows nothing'' and top out about $52,000 a year (he declined to discuss his own salary and that of his brothers; the three are the co-owners). Twelve of the 29 workers are in their 20s, six in their 50s; 16 have been with Caiazzo more than five years, four of them more than 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of these guys start out from scratch, they start out on the truck,'' Anthony Caiazzo said. ''Education I don't ask about. Driver's license is what I insist on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance -- health, auto, liability, worker's compensation -- is the company's biggest expense after payroll and materials: about $400,000 a year, double what it was in 2000. The company offers health benefits, splitting the premiums with employees, but many of the workers do not participate in the plan because, Mr. Caiazzo said, ''the young guys don't want benefits; the young guys want the money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Joe the Plumber, the big jokes about plumbers were that they kept you waiting longer, and charged more, than doctors. The waiting, Little Joe explained this way: ''I work on old houses, so you touch old pipes, they start leaking.'' Of the clients, he said, ''They're usually nice until we give them the bill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back at the office, Uncle Anthony gets the complaints. Why did it cost $120 to install a nickel washer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I say, 'Well, bring your sink down to me, I'll charge you $25,' '' he explained. ''Going from one spot to the next spot is time, and someone's got to pay for it.'' And those fancy $2,500 cameras that see through walls, so you don't have to tear up the whole thing to find the problem spot? ''It costs money to buy 'em,'' he said. ''It's got to cost money to use 'em.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Joe and his girlfriend, a social worker, live with his parents and his four siblings in the Long Island home where he grew up. He and Anthony often cook dinner together in the kitchen they recently renovated, and they're planning to turn the basement into a suite for the young couple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When gasoline prices were high this summer, Big Joe parked his pickup truck and counted on friends for rides; now, given the economy, he feels pretty lucky to be getting plenty of overtime and to have enough money for a recent weekend in Pittsburgh to visit old friends. He went to Nassau Community College for a year and a half to please his mother, a nurse, but really never considered any other job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Plumbing is like a puzzle, and I have to figure it out,'' he explained. ''Mentally that's tougher than doing the work.'' Standing among the metal beams and plywood that would someday be a <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, he pointed to a spot on the floor, ''This is a mop sink.'' Then, to an identical-looking spot, ''This is going to be a hand sink right here.'' Of a square between metal bars, ''This is the bathroom area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Joe does not miss the two years he spent overhauling the Queens Plaza subway station (''It's hot in the subways in the summer; it's sweltering''), and he is the right guy to ask if you want to know where the bathrooms are in a bank (''By my fourth or fifth <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, it was a piece of cake''). A bad day is driving to New Jersey to pick up a part rather than getting his hands dirty. Or getting his hands too dirty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The worst part is cleaning out a grease trap,'' he said. ''There's nothing fun about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little Joe, too, counts the worst days as those spent in traffic, shuttling from Brooklyn to Staten Island to Long Island and back. ''When you're working, the day goes a lot quicker,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After high school, thinking ''maybe I should not start working for the rest of my life already,'' Little Joe enrolled in Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. But September brought ''a stretch of real good waves'' in the Rockaways, where he still lives with his parents, so he skipped a lot of classes, and then he skipped them all. ''I could have studied business,'' he said. ''But I could learn that off my father or my uncle -- they've been doing it for years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the annual boiler inspections required for all public-access buildings in New York -- 10 or 15 minutes jotting down model numbers and filling in a page-long safety checklist that requires no tools beyond a flashlight and a pen -- Little Joe likes fixing boilers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You think; you use your brain,'' he explained. ''You're going from control to control to see why it's not firing -- a boiler is just one big circuit. I like using my head.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, about that election:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Joe watched all three presidential debates, and got up early to vote -- for Mr. Obama. ''I'm not making $250,000 a year, so I'm not going to be taxed like that,'' he noted. Anthony Caiazzo voted for Mr. McCain because, he said, ''there's some things about Obama's ways that just don't sit right with me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Little Joe, who gets the Joe the Plumber treatment virtually every time he introduces himself on a service call -- which is to say four or five times a day -- did not vote. ''I don't know enough about it, never really took interest in it,'' he shrugged. ''I think it's all just an act.''</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY community bankers have money to lend to small businesses now -- but they are being more demanding than they were a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They don't have to ratchet back as much as the larger banks, because they don't have the huge write-downs,'' said Paul Merski, the chief economist of the Independent Community Bankers of America. But he said the uncertain economic climate is prompting local bankers to be more cautious, either by writing smaller loans or by requiring more collateral.</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been happening across the country, at financial institutions large and small, according to the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which the Federal Reserve conducted in early October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 75 percent of domestic banks reported tightening their lending standards for small businesses -- defined by the Federal Reserve as companies with less than $50 million a year in sales -- since the prior quarterly survey in July. And 60 percent of the bankers said they were granting smaller credit lines to small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a time when it really helps small-business owners to have a relationship with a local bank,'' Mr. Merski said, ''so they can go in there and sit across from a live human being and talk through the conditions and terms of their loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert C. Seiwert, the director of the American Bankers Association's Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking, said that some local bankers were ''proactively going after customers on their wish lists who are at banks that are having some problems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seiwert advises small-business owners to talk to their current bankers about what kind of money would be available to them, and on what terms. ''Don't wait until you need the money,'' he said. ''And if you don't like what you hear, shop around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community bankers in various parts of the country were asked to provide snapshots of the small-business environment and financing options in their regions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Southeast</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida was among a handful of markets where home prices rose the most during the real estate boom. Now prices are collapsing across the state, said James H. McKillop III, the president and chief executive of the Independent Bankers' Bank of Florida in Lake Mary, with $450 million in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The construction industry benefited greatly when housing prices were rising. And that meant that you weren't just employing the plumbers and the electricians, but all of the people who served them,'' Mr. McKillop said. ''Now, there's a negative multiplier effect. So a loan to a dry cleaning establishment, or a mom-and-pop grocery store, becomes more problematic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McKillop, who is a board member of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, says he sees a similar pattern in Atlanta and its suburbs. Even parts of the Southeast where home prices did not skyrocket during the boom -- like Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama -- were being hit with a slowdown in home construction and automobile sales, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So six months ago, Mr. McKillop's bank began tightening its lending standards for many typical small-business owners like hairdressers and car dealers. In some cases, the bank asked for more collateral to secure some existing credit lines if the customers' credit had worsened. Some small-business owners needed to put up more collateral because they had used their home equity to secure credit lines, and now their homes were ''under water,'' meaning borrowers owed more on them than they were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booming oil and gas industry along the Western Slope has cushioned Colorado somewhat from the nationwide economic slump. But if oil and gas prices keep falling, that could hurt the local oil field service companies and their suppliers, said John Ikard, the president and chief executive of FirstBank, a private bank holding company in Lakewood, Colo., a suburb of Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FirstBank, which has $9.3 billion in assets, owns 26 separately chartered banks in Colorado, Arizona and California. It does much of its lending in Denver, where until recently Mr. Ikard was the chairman of the city's chamber of commerce. He said that Denver was in better economic shape than some Western cities where home prices had declined more, like Phoenix and Las Vegas. But even in Denver, Mr. Ikard said, restaurant bookings appear to have fallen off. ''You used to have to make a reservation to get into one of the better restaurants,'' he said. ''Now you can just walk right in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ikard said he was more concerned about Vail, Colo., where he said there had been a big decline in vacation home construction. In addition, advance bookings there are so bleak that he has heard this might be the ski resort's worst winter season in 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ikard said that FirstBank had plenty of money to lend and that he saw this as an opportunity to cherry-pick the best small-business customers away from other banks. But he said that his loan officers could also be more demanding of applicants today than a year or two ago, partly because there is less competition from other lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midwest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit may be the epicenter of the American automobile industry, but its fault lines spread into Michigan and western Ohio, where many small businesses supply parts and services to Detroit's Big Three automakers. Art Johnson, a banker in Grand Rapids, Mich., said he would be hard-pressed to think of a community in his state that was not touched by the troubled auto industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson is the chairman and chief executive of the United Bank of Michigan, a private bank with $420 million in assets. It has 12 branches in the western part of the state, where several large furniture makers have their headquarters, including Herman Miller, <span class="companylink">Steelcase</span> and Hayworth. ''They have a lot of excess inventory now, although it's far less dramatic than the auto industry,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one bright spot in the Midwestern economy has been agriculture. But commodity prices have been falling recently. Mr. Johnson said that would hurt not only the farmers, but also the small businesses that build grain elevators or sell farm tools, seed and fertilizer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said that small-business owners had started coming into his bank seeking a new lender because their old bank had turned them away. ''If it's a creditworthy customer, we are going to put an offer on the table,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-business owners are also walking into <span class="companylink">Northeast Bank</span>, based in Lewiston, Me. ''In some cases, we are taking back customers that we used to have, but they left us for a big regional bank because maybe the rate was a little better,'' said James D. Delamater, the president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Northeast Bancorp</span>, a publicly traded bank with $600 million in assets and 11 branches in Maine. ''But now the customers are coming back to us and saying, my bank will no longer lend to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism is the heart of Maine's economy, so many of the local small businesses are hotels, restaurants and recreational outfits. ''The hotels used to get bookings three years in advance,'' Mr. Delamater said. ''But everything is last-minute now. I think people are waiting to book because they aren't sure they can still afford a vacation. And they're obviously looking for deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Northeast Bancorp</span> has a bigger sandbox in which to play because it participates in small-business loans originated by lenders across the country. In some cases, the bank will keep the loans on its books, while in others it collects a brokerage fee for selling them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Delamater said that a year ago the bank had about 40 of these relationships with other lenders, but today it is closer to half that number. He said that some of the commercial loan originators the bank had worked with had either gone out of business or were making fewer loans. ''Now most of our loan participations are with other community banks like us,'' he said.</p>

<tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>LP</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holiday Season</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking Cheerless</p>
</td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="top" class="index"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gloomy outlook unveiled this week by the electronics giant <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> and a plunge in September retail sales show that consumers are in full retreat. December could be the first holiday season on record in which retail sales decline. That would threaten many retailers' ability to make full-year profits and further knock investor confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales figures are expressed in nominal dollars. That means that when inflation is present, reported sales can rise even if they decline in inflation-adjusted terms. Since the Census Bureau began keeping records in 1953, there has never been a December in which nominal retail sales fell below the previous year. That's because deep recessions have coincided with periods of high inflation. From 1979 to 1981, for example, retail sales rose in all three years in nominal terms, even though they dropped sharply in real or inflation-adjusted terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, though, nominal retail sales are dropping fast enough that year-over-year sales growth may drop below zero in December, despite rising prices. In September, for example, nominal sales were 1 percent below the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales decline is accelerating. <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>, whose competitor <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span> filed for bankruptcy protection this week, reported nominal comparable-store sales that were down 7.6 percent in October after a 2.4 percent fall in September. Even <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores</span>, which benefits from belt-tightening by consumers, reported an increase in comparable-store sales of only 2.4 percent in October, a 2.5 percent decline in real terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the Thanksgiving effect may keep December's nominal retail sales growth positive. The holiday is late this year, pushing some sales into December from November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decline in retail sales is arguably desirable to improve the savings rate and rebalance the economy. However, since many retailers' profitability for the year depends on holiday season sales, a Christmas with the first nominal retail sales decline in at least 55 years could be a serious short-term blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Expectations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrastructure may look to be an asset class that has escaped the market turmoil. Investors poured $21.5 billion into infrastructure funds in the first nine months of the year, more than in 2006, according to Probitas Partners, a California research firm. Probitas estimates that in the next year, $94 billion of funds will be searching for investments. What's more, investors are expecting 12 to 15 percent annual returns, a higher goal than before the credit crisis hit. They could be disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds need higher returns than ever because the yield on other long-term investments has risen. A 10-year bond recently issued by <span class="companylink">Altria</span>, the tobacco company, came with a 10 percent yield. But it's hard to collect high enough returns on such projects as lenders become less willing to accept high leverage. The equity portion of investments has doubled to 40 percent since last year. Debt is more expensive, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, infrastructure assets like airports and highways aren't completely insulated from economic woes. They may have relatively stable cash flows. But traffic at BAA, the British airports group, was 5 percent lower in September than a year earlier. Road traffic has fallen in past recessions, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make the numbers work, infrastructure investors would have to pay much lower prices for infrastructure assets, perhaps some 30 percent below last year's levels for the funds to achieve a 12 percent return at the lower leverage levels that now apply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices of stocks and commodities have fallen more than that. State and local governments or companies might be forced to sell cheap. And while the expected flood of infrastructure buyers should bolster asset prices, some big players like Australia's Macquarie look less active lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the example of the Pennsylvania Turnpike isn't encouraging. Many analysts thought the $12.8 billion price was rich. But politicians vetoed the deal. Any suspicion of selling a trophy asset on the cheap is not good politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another way that these funds could hit their targets. Most are assuming they can refinance the debt on better terms in the next two or three years, increasing returns. That might happen. But in the short term, something has to give: the cost of debt, the price of assets, or investor returns. The last looks to be the most likely casualty.</p>
