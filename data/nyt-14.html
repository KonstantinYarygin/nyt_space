</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM J. BROAD and KENNETH CHANG </div><div>891 words</div><div>29 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration on Monday unveiled a space policy that renounces the unilateral stance of the Bush administration and instead emphasizes international cooperation, including the possibility of an arms control treaty that would limit the development of space weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, both China and the United States have destroyed satellites in orbit, raising fears about the start of a costly arms race that might ultimately hurt the United States because it dominates the military use of space. China smashed a satellite in January 2007, and the United States did so in February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new space policy explicitly says that Washington will ''consider proposals and concepts for arms control measures if they are equitable, effectively verifiable and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration, in the space policy it released in August 2006, said it ''rejects any limitations on the fundamental right of the United States to operate in and acquire data from space,'' a phrase that was interpreted as giving a green light to the development and use of antisatellite weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy also stated that Washington would ''oppose the development of new legal regimes or other restrictions that seek to prohibit or limit U.S. access or use of space,'' a phrase that effectively ruled out arms control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In secret, the Bush administration engaged in research that critics said could produce a powerful ground-based laser, among other potential weapons meant to shatter enemy satellites in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the Obama policy underlines the need for international cooperation. ''It is the shared interest of all nations to act responsibly in space to help prevent mishaps, misperceptions and mistrust,'' the new policy says in its opening lines. ''Space operations should be conducted in ways that emphasize openness and transparency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Marquez, director of space policy at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Monday that the policy was reverting to a less confrontational approach that the United States had championed in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The arms control language is bipartisan language that appeared in the Reagan policy and George H. W. Bush's policy and the Clinton policy,'' Mr. Marquez said in a White House briefing. ''So we're bringing it back to a bipartisan agreed-upon position.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Abramson, a senior analyst at the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington, said the new policy ''sets the stage for progress in space arms control -- without getting into specifics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, diplomats from around the globe have gathered in Geneva to hammer out a treaty on the ''prevention of an arms race in outer space,'' which would ban space weapons. Arms control supporters say that China and Russia have backed the process, and that the United States during the Bush administration dragged its feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, John Mohanco, a State Department official, told the diplomats in Geneva that as long as attacks on satellites remained a threat, ''our government will continue to consider the possible role that space-related weapons may play in protecting our assets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Obama administration has stopped the saber-rattling and started what might end in a new kind of peaceful accord -- though with plenty of caveats and vague conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the new policy calls on the United States to ''lead in the enhancement of security, stability and responsible behavior in space,'' it also says that any resulting arms treaties would have to be equitable, verifiable and enhance the security interests of the United States and its allies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those are the gates,'' Mr. Marquez told reporters, ''that the arms control proposals must come through before we consider them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House said the State Department would make more details public in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama said in a statement that the new policy was ''designed to strengthen America's leadership in space while fostering untold rewards here on Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the civilian use of space, the policy, which is 14 pages long, puts renewed emphasis on the commercial space industry, reflecting the administration's desire to get the National Aeronautics and Space Administration out of the business of launching astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listed first among the administration's space goals is to ''energize domestic industries.'' That contrasts with the top goal of the 2006 Bush administration policy, to ''strengthen the nation's space leadership,'' and that of the 1996 Clinton administration policy, to ''enhance the knowledge of the Earth, the solar system and the universe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush policy asserted that the government would buy commercial services ''to the maximum practical extent'' and refrain from federal activities that would discourage or compete with commercial options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama policy retains those provisions and, in addition, calls on federal agencies to ''actively explore the use of inventive, nontraditional arrangements'' like creating public-private partnerships, flying government instruments on commercial spacecraft or buying data from commercial satellite operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial space section of the Obama policy also includes provisions for promoting American commercial space industry in foreign markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the Bush administration highlighted national security concerns, like preventing unfriendly countries from obtaining advanced technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of that approach said the same technologies could often be bought from other countries, adding that the limitations hurt American aerospace companies without improving the nation's security.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the space shuttle era will end a little later. NASA announced Thursday that the launching of the last space shuttle flight was now intended for early next year. With two flights remaining, the shuttles had been scheduled to be retired by September. But the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which was to be taken to the International Space Station next month, ran into technical difficulties, pushing that mission to late November. That flight has now been further pushed back, to Feb. 26, 2011. The launching of the second-to-last shuttle mission has also been delayed, to Nov. 1 instead of Sept. 16.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO -- The Japanese are calling it a miracle. The Hayabusa space probe returned last month from a seven-year, 382-million-mile round trip to an asteroid, giving a much-needed confidence boost to a country worried that its technological prowess might be waning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Japan is still holding its breath. Did the mission accomplish one of its main objectives?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary tests on a capsule retrieved from the probe have shown no signs of the precious samples of the 4.6-billion-year-old asteroid that the Hayabusa was supposed to retrieve -- samples that scientists around the globe had hoped would hold new clues about the formation of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, known as JAXA, followed up with better news. Scientists had detected traces of vaporized material inside the container, some of it possibly from the asteroid, Itokawa, which goes around the sun on an elliptical orbit that crosses the paths of both Earth and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hayabusa capsule yields gas,'' declared one newspaper headline. ''Vapor gives us hope,'' read another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June 13 return of the Hayabusa, which drew heavily on Japanese industrial expertise, has fanned hopes that this nation has not lost its edge in technology and manufacturing. The American journal Science has called Hayabusa -- the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid and return to Earth, as well as the longest round-trip mission to outer space -- a ''trailblazer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese companies hope the mission can translate to sales in the steadily expanding market for space technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the nonprofit Space Foundation, based in Colorado, the commercial and governmental global market for satellites and other space infrastructure grew to $261 billion in 2009, up 7 percent from 2008 and 40 percent over the last five years. But Japanese companies so far have failed to gain much traction as prime contractors in the global satellite communications market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEC, which built the probe's advanced ion engines, wants to sell its technology in the United States, to NASA as well as to commercial customers through a joint venture with the American aerospace firm <span class="companylink">Aerojet</span>-General.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ion engines use electric fields, instead of chemical reactions, to propel rockets and satellites. They are less powerful but more efficient than conventional chemical engines and can last for years before running out of fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information technology behemoth Fujitsu, meanwhile, is aggressively marketing its communications systems, which are credited with guiding the Hayabusa spacecraft back to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And IHI, which developed the probe's heat-resistance technology, says it hopes to build on the mission's publicity to double the revenue from its space-related business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An expert panel was appointed earlier this year to advise the government on ways to help double Japanese companies' earnings from their space businesses to at least 14 trillion yen ($158 billion).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Achieving big goals is always accompanied with adversity, but where there's a strong will, there's a way,'' NEC's president, Nobuhiro Endo, said at a shareholders' meeting on June 22, showing off a scaled model of the Hayabusa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan, the fourth country after the United States, France and the former Soviet Union to put a satellite into orbit, in 1977, has since launched a string of successful rockets and has been intent on being a space power. But its aspirations have more recently been usurped by China, which put a man in space -- a feat Japan has not yet managed on its own -- and it has also incurred a series of setbacks, including a Mars probe launched in 1998 that failed to reach orbit around that planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency -- known as JAXA -- with a budget of about 230 billion yen for 2010 ($2.6 billion), is still relatively tiny compared with the United States' NASA and its $18.7 billion budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched on a Japanese rocket in May 2003, the Hayabusa (translation: peregrine falcon) had a benighted journey. After the probe landed in 2005 on the Itokawa asteroid, which is about a third of a mile long and shaped like a potato, its sample-capture mechanism went awry. To the public's dismay, JAXA officials said they were not sure whether any samples had been collected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, the probe's robotic rover, meant to take photos and temperature readings on the asteroid, inexplicably floated off into space and was never heard from again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse yet, after Hayabusa took off from the asteroid, all four of NEC's ion engines shut down. So did all 12 of the chemical-fueled rocket engines made by another space industry giant, <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</span>. The probe was left drifting in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, for more than seven weeks, for reasons still not clear, there were no communication signals from the probe. Public dismay quickly turned to derision and, eventually, indifference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 49th day of radio silence, the Hayabusa control room finally made contact with the probe, Junichiro Kawaguchi, the mission's leader, recalled in an interview. But scientists intent on remotely reviving the failed engines succeeded only in getting the undamaged half of one ion engine to work with the undamaged portion of a second engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Hayabusa limping along, JAXA had to drastically alter its original plan, which had called for the probe to approach Earth, eject its capsule of samples back into the atmosphere and then remain in orbit awaiting orders for a new mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the equivalent of only one full engine made it impossible for the probe to muster the propulsion to escape Earth's gravitational pull. The probe itself would have to re-enter the atmosphere in a ball of fire, with only the heatproof sample capsule surviving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could see the sparks as the probe disintegrated,'' Mr. Kawaguchi said of the June 13 re-entry. ''It was a miraculous return, yet I had very mixed emotions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Hayabusa's fiery return, three years later than the originally scheduled capsule drop, has generally been hailed as a national triumph. Fans flocked to public viewings, some decked out in handmade costumes meant to resemble the probe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, as JAXA continues to slowly open and examine the capsule, officials say it will take months to determine whether it contains any asteroid samples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Japanese space experts choose to see the glass as more than half full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What Hayabusa has shown is the reliability of Japan's technology,'' said Hiroaki Akiyama, a specialist in planet geology at Wakayama University in western Japan. ''Traveling to the asteroid, making a landing and then returning to Earth is in itself a near miracle,'' he said. ''The return of the probe has proven that Japan's space program might not be big, but it is one of the most advanced in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fear lingers that after its million-mile errand of retrieval, the Hayabusa falcon has returned with empty talons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there are no meaningful asteroid samples, space enthusiasts fear that public disappointment could lead the government to slash spending on basic space exploration programs. Most directly at stake, as Tokyo tries to rein in public spending, is a second Hayabusa mission planned for around 2014 to journey to another asteroid -- this time in a search for water or organic matter -- looking for clues not just to the Earth's beginnings but to the origins of life itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Democratic government, which took office in September and is now led by a new prime minister, Naoto Kan, is talking a fiscal hard line. The Democrats had threatened to scale back this year's approximately $1.9 million budget for the Hayabusa 2 program to less than $565,000, although Mr. Kan has recently said he will consider reviving financing for the next Hayabusa project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while initial polls after the Hayabusa's return showed renewed public support for increased space spending, doubts are already surfacing in the news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Apart from making it back to Earth, there aren't any results to show,'' the influential Nikkei Industrial Journal said in an editorial on Monday. ''With three out of four engines breaking down, there is no proof that the technology is reliable. And it's extremely suspect that any sand from the asteroid was collected -- the goal of the mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Kawaguchi, the Hayabusa project leader, and other space industry insiders say the real failure will come if Japan gives up so easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, there were problems, but we learned how to overcome those -- that's the whole point,'' he said. ''We've sent a message out to the world that Japanese technology still leads.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 7, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about Japan's Hayabusa space probe misstated the mission's precedents. The Hayabusa was the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid and return to Earth, and it was the longest round-trip mission to outer space and back. But it was not Earth's first visitor to an asteroid or the longest space mission yet. The article also erroneously attributed a distinction to Japan in placing a satellite in orbit. It was the fourth nation to do so, following the Soviet Union, the United States and France -- not the third. (It was third, after the United States and the Soviet Union, in placing a geostationary satellite in space.) The article also misstated, in some editions, the tardiness of the Hayabusa capsule's return; it was three years behind schedule, not two.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW did you celebrate World U.F.O. Day?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You didn't?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dang. Nobody seems to remember any more that July 2, 1947 was the day of the Roswell crash in the New Mexico desert (a spacecraft from another world, say some; a test balloon, says the government) that became the touchstone for those who believe aliens have come to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they certainly don't remember that World U.F.O. Day is celebrated by some on June 24, to commemorate the first widely reported U.F.O. sighting by Kenneth Arnold, a pilot who claimed to see what he would call ''flying saucers'' over Mount Rainier the same year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From those days, our cultural love affair with little green men has gone through the stages of many passionate relationships -- the fear and hopefulness of ''The Day The Earth Stood Still'' in 1951; the quirky cuddliness of Ray Walston as ''My Favorite Martian'' in the '60s. We laugh, we cry, and then we scream again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Off screen, however, we seem to have drifted apart: sightings rarely capture the popular imagination. Now that cellphone cameras are all but ubiquitous, there isn't a moment that can't be snapped -- so if the truth really were out there, we'd see it. And we haven't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say that the number of sightings has dwindled. Groups like the National UFO Reporting Center receive hundreds of reports each month, and The Weekly World News supplies the latest in otherworldly headlines. (''Alien Tells Larry King to Leave CNN,'' the newspaper reported on June 29.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The community of sighters has really expanded through digital technology -- on a global basis,'' said Neil McGinness, the chief executive of Weekly World News. ''It really speeds up now because the chatter on the Web -- it just burns like crazy.'' And The Weekly World News, the happy home of Bat Boy and other paranormal stories, is happily receptive. Alien stories draw readers and reader comments -- ''probably more so than any other phenomenon,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these days, U.F.O. sightings rarely cause a stir outside of Mr. McGinness's pages or Web sites for buffs, says John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org. ''The 'Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky' no longer resonates with the public the way it did when a tricorder or talking computers seemed miraculous,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when incidents break out of the buff ghetto nowadays, smarty-pants killjoys often come up with perfectly reasonable explanations. Take the recent spiraling light over Australia, which many took to be a U.F.O. It was quickly tied to the launch of Falcon 9, the spacecraft created by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's company, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Plait, the creator of the debunk-eriffic Bad Astronomy blog at Discovermagazine.com, says that on the one hand, digital media ''may be hurting the cause of reality: such nonsense gets spread much faster than it used to.'' But ''it's easier for the correct explanation to spread as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that in March, people marveled at a bright object over Lake Erie and Cleveland. Mr. Plait wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Could it be an alien visitor from another world? No, I don't think so. In fact, I think it is another world. Venus, to be specific.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic problem, Mr. Plait said, is that people rarely look up into the dark sky and know what's normal, much less abnormal. The singer James McMurtry summed it up nicely in his song ''Levelland'':</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mama used to roll her hair</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back before the central air</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We'd sit outside and watch the stars at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She'd tell me to make a wish,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd wish we both could fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't think she's seen the sky</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since we got the satellite dish. ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the odds are steeply against humans being the only life in the vastness of the universe. The blunt reality of distance measured in light-years, however, makes travel between the stars unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, we hold on to the mysteries left to us, savoring guilty pleasures like Larry King's alien (check the picture -- that could be a family resemblance) and not trying too hard to understand phenomena like the Marfa lights. On this planet, where a hole in the ground of our own making spews millions of gallons of toxic slush, surely it's O.K. to hope that there's intelligent life, well, somewhere.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contrast in tone between the new national space policy unveiled by President Obama last week and the policy adopted by the Bush administration four years ago is striking. The Bush policy was jingoistic, unilateral in approach, and resistant to arms control in space. The Obama policy is cooperative, international in approach, and open to a verifiable arms control treaty to restrain the development of space weapons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of an arms race in space or a space-based conflict is not science fiction. China knocked down one of its own satellites in 2007, and the United States did the same the following year. (Beijing offered no explanation for smashing a weather satellite; Washington said it needed to destroy the disabled spy satellite before it tumbled to earth and vented its toxic fuel.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has a clear strategic interest in curbing the spread of weapons that could destroy satellites from the ground or from perches in space. A treaty is the best hope of doing that. The military relies heavily on communication and intelligence satellites -- more so than other nations' militaries. The American economy is also hugely dependent on satellite communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new policy states that Washington will consider arms control measures that are ''equitable, effectively verifiable and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies.'' Those are important conditions that should be possible for negotiators to meet. The policy also calls for ''openness and transparency'' in conducting operations in space, and for responsible behavior by all nations to help prevent ''mishaps, misperceptions and mistrust'' that could lead to conflict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any hawks who fear the administration may shrink from defending American interests in space ought to be mollified by assertions that all nations have the right to use space for national security activities and that the United States stands ready to defend its space systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new policy calls for wider international cooperation in exploring space, studying climate change, and tracking and removing orbital debris that poses a risk to spacecraft passing through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It reinforces President Obama's plan to rely more heavily on commercial companies to carry cargo and astronauts into low earth orbit, abandon another landing on the moon, and develop new technologies to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 and to the orbit of Mars by 2035. Many members of Congress are resistant, and the president will need to persuade them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its welcome call for international cooperation, the paper does not invite other nations to join in those trips to distant worlds. Any policy that purports to promote peaceful collaboration in space ought to enlist other nations in these challenging and costly missions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching of a new Air Force space surveillance satellite has been delayed due to a software problem in a rocket similar to the one that will lift the satellite into orbit. The Space-Based Space Surveillance satellite was scheduled to lift off Thursday from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. No new launching date has been set. Air Force officials said Tuesday that tests revealed a software problem on another Minotaur IV rocket. No other details have been released.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW ORLEANS -- Republican and Democratic leaders on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation are moving toward an authorization bill that would reverse large swaths of President Obama's proposed changes to NASA's human space flight program, a ranking Republican involved in the talks confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill, which lays out the direction of the nation's space program for the next three years, would add at least one more space shuttle flight, speed development of a heavy-lift rocket and move ahead with building a spacecraft to venture beyond low-Earth orbit. It would also slow down a rush to invest in commercial rockets by requiring companies to demonstrate their capabilities before receiving large contracts for delivering astronauts to the International Space Station, said a staff member who was not authorized to speak for attribution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are moving in that direction,'' acknowledged Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the commerce committee's space subcommittee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's human spaceflight program has been in limbo since February, when the Obama administration unveiled a budget request that would cancel the space agency's current program to send astronauts back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the president's proposal, the human spaceflight program would shift its focus to developing new space technologies for several years before embarking on a program to reach more distant destinations of an asteroid around 2025 and Mars a decade later. The administration would also largely take NASA out of the rocket-building business and instead hire private companies that would provide a space taxi service for its astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's plan has not gained wide support in Congress, but neither has there been a groundswell to keep the current moon program, known as Constellation, which would need a large increase in financing to put it back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A House subcommittee working on the 2011 budget last week agreed to finance NASA next year at $19 billion as requested by Mr. Obama, but sidestepped the controversy of what the money would be spent on by saying it would defer to what emerged in the NASA authorization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate bill resulted from negotiations between Senator John D. Rockefeller of West Virginia, a Democrat who is chairman of the commerce committee; Senator Kay Bailey of Hutchison, the committee's ranking Republican; Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat who is chairman of the commerce committee's space subcommittee, and Mr. Vitter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill marks a sign that Congressional opponents can move beyond their dislike of what Mr. Obama has proposed and devise an alternative that can attract bipartisan support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vitter, who attended a ceremony Thursday morning at a NASA factory here to mark the delivery of the last external fuel tank for the space shuttles, described the agreement as close, but added, ''I don't want to announce something as done until it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its current version, the bill would direct NASA to fly one more space shuttle mission in the second half of next year. The bill would also in effect restore full capabilities to the Constellation program's Orion crew capsule by telling NASA to build a spacecraft that can undertake deep-space missions to destinations like the moon or an asteroid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, President Obama said he wanted to retain the Orion crew capsule after shuttering the Constellation program, but as a stripped-down lifeboat for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorization also directs NASA to start development of a new heavy-lift rocket immediately rather than waiting as late as 2015 in the president's proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the details of the Senate bill have been decided yet, and the corresponding committee in the House of Representatives has not yet begun work on its version of the authorization bill. It is also likely that the administration will fight to keep aspects of its plan that it still wants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate committee is scheduled to discuss and mark up the bill, known as the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, next Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easter Island, Chile</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON this Pacific outpost, 2,200 miles west of the South American coast, hundreds of us have gathered, exchanging warm greetings and catching up on life since we last saw one another -- in the Galapagos five years ago, or in Zambia nine years ago, or in Papua New Guinea 16 years ago. We are umbraphiles: having once stood in the umbra, the Moon's shadow, during a solar eclipse, we are driven to do so again and again, whenever the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun. In 1959, I saw my first eclipse. Sunday afternoon, I'll see my 51st.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some highlights from my log:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eclipse No. 1, 1959: Aboard an airplane flying over the Massachusetts coast. As the full Moon covered the Sun and the sky darkened to black, the Sun's corona outlined the Moon in white. I was hooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 3, 1970: In a cloudless sky over Miahuatlan, Mexico, south of Oaxaca. As eclipse darkness fell, the stars and planets came into view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 5, 1973: An extraordinary seven-minute eclipse north of Timbuktu, Mali. In Kenya, where we observed, it lasted five minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 12, 1983: Partly cloudy skies diminished visibility in East Java, Indonesia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 19, 1992: I chartered a jet to fly an hour south of Cape Town, South Africa, and the view was clear and spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 23, 1995: In Rajasthan, India. The light dimmed eerily as the shadows sharpened. Next, the dazzling diamond-ring effect, as the last ray of sunlight shone through a valley on the Moon's surface, contrasting the lunar jewel with the still-faint solar corona forming the ring's band. A stunning red loop of gas appeared at the Sun's edge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 29, 1999: West of Bucharest, Romania. Sunspots -- at the peak of their cycle that year -- made the corona bristle with giant streamers. We made great progress in our study of how the corona is heated to millions of degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 47, 2008: In Akademgorodok, outside Novosibirsk, Siberia. Sunspot activity was now low, and coronal streamers extended only from the Sun's equator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No. 49, 2009: From mountains outside of Hangzhou, China, we videotaped clouds passing the corona, adding a dramatic effect to the eclipse (even as it made our data harder to process).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My 51st experience will begin today at 2:08 p.m. local time (4:08 in New York).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're here for the science, yes. But there's also the primal thrill this astronomical light show always brings -- the perfect alignment, in solemn darkness, of the celestial bodies that mean most to us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when it's over we'll start planning for Australia (Nov. 13, 2012) and Gabon (Nov. 3, 2013). On Aug. 21, 2017, an eclipse -- my 60th? -- will cross the United States from northwest to southeast. May the clouds part then for all of us.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>653 words</div><div>20 July 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its third swing past Mercury, NASA's Mercury Messenger spacecraft discovered an unexpectedly young lava plain, rapid rufflings of the planet's weak magnetic field and an unanticipated dance of elements in the thin atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the biggest surprise for the community is that the planet is turning out to be much more dynamic than people appreciated,'' said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington who is the principal investigator for the Messenger mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flyby occurred in September, when the spacecraft swooped within 142 miles of Mercury's surface at 12,000 miles per hour, but the findings of that flyby just appeared in three papers the journal Science published last week on its Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the 180-mile-wide double-ring Rachmaninoff crater, Messenger photographed flat, smooth plains that scientists interpreted as the hardened outflow of lava. Based on the number of smaller impact craters, the age of the volcanic deposits within Rachmaninoff is probably less than two billion years, said Louise K. Procktor of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and lead author of the paper that examined the crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not recent, that would still suggest that Mercury was volcanically active well into its middle age, given that it formed 4.5 billion years ago with the rest of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is quite a big surprise,'' Dr. Procktor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercury, not much more than 3,000 miles in diameter, is by far the smallest of the planets, and thus many thought it would have cooled off in less than a billion years. But Mercury's mantle may not rise and fall in convective patterns as in larger planets like Earth, and that may have kept the heat inside for more than two billion years. By imparting heat and relieving pressure, the impact of the meteoroid that formed the crater may have helped melt rocks that were already close to melting point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger's measurements also detected rapid fluctuations in Mercury's magnetic field as it shifted from one side of the planet to the other. Such fluctuations occur around Earth in a matter of hours. Around Mercury, the fields shifted in minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked as though we were seeing a complete collapse of the magnetic field,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''This is an incredibly dynamic magnetosphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third paper looked at Mercury's tenuous atmosphere, which consists of atoms knocked off the surface by sunlight, charged particles and dust-size meteoroids. One surprise was that near the equator, the concentration of calcium was higher near sunrise than sunset, but that effect was not seen for sodium or magnesium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because only calcium and not the other elements exhibits this behavior, ''We can't explain it,'' said Ronald J. Vervack Jr., another scientist at the Johns Hopkins laboratory and lead author of that Science paper. ''They just don't look the same, and they don't look the same anywhere we look,'' he said. ''Which is a bit puzzling, because we expected there to be some similarities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tail of sodium that had been seen behind Mercury during the first two flybys, in January 2008 and October 2008, was much diminished in the third flyby. The reason was that Mercury was in a different part of its elliptical orbit, and the resulting change in velocity diminished the power of sunlight that was sweeping the sodium atoms away from Mercury into the tail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A clearer picture should start to emerge next year. The spacecraft, launched in 2004, has been doing a gravitational do-si-do with the inner planets to slow down as it spirals inward and gets in position to enter orbit around Mercury in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An authorization bill put together by a House committee for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would greatly scale back President Obama's plans to spur a commercial market for the launching of people into space and would direct the agency to continue developing its own rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill from the House Committee on Science and Technology would provide $750 million over five years for the so-called commercial crew initiative -- investing in companies to develop a space taxi service for taking astronauts into orbit; that is far less than the $6 billion the Obama administration requested and less than the $1.3 billion over three years that a Senate committee approved in its version of the authorization bill last week. In addition, $500 million of the money in the House bill would be in the form of loans and loan guarantees rather than direct financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas O. Stanley, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a former NASA manager, said the loan guarantees were ''a very interesting and innovative approach'' that could make more money available for the companies at less cost to NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House bill, to be discussed at a committee meeting on Thursday, would leave to NASA the decision of what to build as a government alternative, but it would most likely include the Orion crew capsule and perhaps even the Ares I rocket. The administration would like to cancel the Ares I as part of its efforts to end the current Constellation program, which was to send astronauts back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate version did not continue development of the Ares I and called for developing a heavy-lift rocket by the end of 2016; the House bill would slow the heavy-lift development, with completion by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House bill does not finance an additional space shuttle flight next year as the Senate bill had called for. By contrast, the House bill adds financing for cutting-edge space technologies, which had been another key component of the Obama space plan but which had been largely eliminated in the Senate bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bretton Alexander, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group, said the draft House bill was ''completely unexecutable'' and would leave the United States dependent on Russia for transportation to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A White House spokesman said the administration was reviewing the House bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are facing tough economic times that demand tough choices,'' the committee's chairman, Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, said in a news release. ''We can't do it all. This bill makes those choices and provides the nation with a credible, sustainable and worthy space and aeronautics program.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A huge ball of brightly burning gas drifting through a neighboring galaxy may be the heaviest star ever discovered -- hundreds of times more massive than the sun, scientists said Wednesday after working out its weight for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those behind the find say the star, called R136a1, may once have weighed as much as 320 solar masses. Astrophysicist Paul Crowther said the obese star -- twice as heavy as any previously discovered -- has already slimmed down considerably over its lifetime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it's burning itself off with such intensity that it shines at nearly 10 million times the luminosity of the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unlike humans, these stars are born heavy and lose weight as they age,'' said Crowther, an astrophysicist at the University of Sheffield in northern England. ''R136a1 is already middle-aged and has undergone an intense weight loss program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowther said the giant was identified at the center of a star cluster in the Tarantula Nebula, a sprawling cloud of gas and dust in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy about 165,000 light-years away from our own Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star was the most massive of several giants identified by Crowther and his team in an article in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While other stars can be larger, notably the swollen crimson-colored ones known as red giants, they weigh far less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the mass of R136a1 and its ilk means they're tens of times bigger than the Earth's sun and they're brighter and hotter, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surface temperatures can surpass 40,000 degrees Celsius (72,000 degrees Fahrenheit), seven times hotter than the sun. They're also several million times brighter, because the greedy giants tear through their energy reserves far faster than their smaller counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That also means that massive stars live fast and die young, quickly shedding huge amounts of material and burning themselves out in what are thought to be spectacular explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest live only 3 million years,'' Crowther said. ''In astronomy that's a very short time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small lifespans are one of several reasons why these obese stars are so hard to find. Another is that they're extremely rare, forming only in the densest star clusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also have a limited range in which to look for them. In clusters that are too far away, it isn't always possible to tell if a telescope has picked up on one heavyweight star or two smaller ones in close proximity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, Crowther's team re-examined previously known stars to see if they could find an accurate measurement of their weight. The team reviewed archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope and gathered new readings from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope at Paranal in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists who weren't involved in the find said the results were impressive, although they cautioned it was still possible, although unlikely, that scientists had confused two very close stars for a bigger, single one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What they're characterizing as a single massive star could in fact be a binary system too close to be resolved,'' said Mark Krumholz, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both he and Phillip Massey, an astronomer with the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, also cautioned that the star's weight had been inferred using scientific models and that those were subject to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But both scientists said the authors had made a strong case, arguing that the solar material being thrown off from feuding stars in a binary system would produce much more powerful X-rays than have been detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowther acknowledged that R136a1 could have a partner, but he said it was likely to be a much smaller star, meaning that the star's its birth weight was still considerable -- perhaps 300 solar masses instead of 320.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lakes of southern Titan are shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of Ontario Lacus, the largest lake in the southern hemisphere of this Saturnian moon, has fallen by some 15 feet over the last four years, causing its shore to recede by as much as 6 miles in some places. Other lakes nearby have similarly receded, according to radar measurements made by the Cassini spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, if prolonged spells of 90-degree temperatures have you yearning for a refreshing icy dip, there are still plenty of bathing opportunities on Titan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course the lakes there are made of liquid methane -- and the 90 degrees of temperature are on the Kelvin scale, near enough to absolute zero to challenge even the most cosmically adept polar bear. The atmosphere is nitrogen and methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titan is the only body in the solar system other than Earth that has been found to harbor liquid on its surface, leading many planetary scientists and aspiring astrobiologists to speculate that the same organic chemical processes that led to life on Earth are occurring in a frozen slush of hydrocarbons on Titan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery that Titan's lakes are evaporating, at least in the Southern Hemisphere, where summer just ended, suggests that there are active weather and geological cycles on Titan analogous to those on Earth. But on Titan the liquid driving those cycles is not water but methane, explained Oded Aharonson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a wonderful opportunity and rare in the solar system to observe a planet with working liquid on its surface, a volatile agent that is responsible for altering its geology and participating in its weather cycle by evaporating and precipitating,'' Dr. Aharonson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research effort was led by Alexander G. Hayes, Dr. Aharonson's graduate student. Mr. Hayes was the lead author of a pair of papers, which will be published in Icarus and the Journal of Geophysical Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists have suspected that Titan might harbor exotic weather and chemistry ever since Voyager 1 flew by Saturn in 1980 and radio signals sent through Titan's atmosphere revealed a thick atmosphere of nitrogen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004 a camera known as the Imaging Science Subsystem on the Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn recorded a blurry image of what looked like a lake basin about the size of Lake Ontario through Titan's hazy atmosphere. That is now named Ontario Lacus. Since then an imaging radar on Cassini has been periodically scanning Titan's terrain, a few strips at a time, during close flybys of the moon. These scans showed smooth dark areas that few scientists doubted were lakes. In January 2005, the Huygens probe landed in what looked like a fluvial plain with channels carved by methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any lingering doubts were removed last year when Cassini's cameras recorded a glint of sunlight bouncing off Kraken Mare, a large lake-shaped basin near Titan's North Pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lakes appear dark on the radar because if they are deeper than about 25 feet the radar waves are completely absorbed and do not come back to the spacecraft. Mr. Hayes and his colleagues were able to gauge the drop in lake levels by simply noting the shrinkage of dark nonreflecting areas and combining that with measurements of the slope of the lake bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the edges of the lake, they could see the lake bottom and thus measure its depth from altimetry, performing what Dr. Aharonson said was the first extraterrestrial bathymetry. The depth results matched the lake shrinkage. Where the slope into the methane was slow and gentle, the lakeshore receded the farthest; where there was a quick drop-off, against some mountains along the northern shore, the lake receded little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why should Titan be behaving like this? Dr. Aharonson said that a rough rule of thumb for hydrological systems like Earth or Titan was to expect that moisture would migrate seasonally from one hemisphere to the other, evaporating where it was summer and precipitating where it was winter. Indeed summer just ended in the southern hemisphere and the measurements show lakes were evaporating there, although there is no evidence that northern lakes are gaining yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the actual dynamics of the Titanium atmosphere, he said, can be much more complicated, leading to cycles tens or hundreds of thousands of years long in which one hemisphere or the other could be wetter or colder than the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the vagaries of its orbit around Saturn and Saturn's orbit around the sun, for example, Titan is closer to the sun during its southern summer than in its northern summer. As a result, southern summers are currently shorter and more intense than their northern counterparts. Dr. Aharonson and his colleagues argued in a recent paperthat this could cause liquid to collect more in the northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere, leading to a net migration of methane to the north over many Titan years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of migration could explain why the area covered by lakes in the north is about 100 times the area of all the lakes in the southern hemisphere. A similar cycle in the dynamics of the Earth's orbit around the Sun leads to what are known as Milankovitch climate cycles, thought to drive the ice ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence for this theory, Dr. Aharonson pointed out that the observed evaporation rate in Ontario Lacus, about three feet a year, is not enough to fill all the lakes in the north in one season, suggesting some longer term effect is at work. ''If we wait 15 years we won't see lakes migrate down to the south,'' he said. But if Titan has tens of thousands of years to move the methane from one hemisphere to the other, he explained, the rate can be much smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evaporation rate, he said, also sends a strong message about what the lakes are made of, namely pure methane, as opposed to heavier ethane or some other chemical, which is less volatile. ''In order to evaporate that much stuff, it has to be stuff that evaporates,'' he said. If there is ethane present it is well mixed, the lake is not coated with a layer of gunk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No tar balls on Titan. Yet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- When I was very young, I cherished a collection of ''space cards'' -- trading cards that accompanied packs of bubble gum -- offering exotic visions that supposedly would soon be within reach: space ships gliding through Saturn's rings; explorers enduring a Venus dust storm; loopy Technicolor Martians making their first contact with visiting Earthlings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those half-century-old imaginings may have been outlandish, but the cards left their mark, assisted by decades of science fiction that confidently assumed we were on the brink of an era of pioneering exploration. In a way, we were, though not quite as those cards suggested. But the appetite they whetted remained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images on view at a remarkable exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum here could well serve as inspirational space cards for this century. But they possess far greater power than those old naive fantasies. They are vividly, compellingly real; they astonish and bewilder, luring the viewer into a state of wonder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In ''Beyond: Visions of Our Solar System'' 148 photographs of moons and planets show these brave new worlds as extraordinary landscapes of mists, dunes, fissures and rocks. The exhibition has appeared in other, more modest incarnations (including as a traveling show), but this is its most complete form. The filmmaker, writer and photographer Michael Benson deserves much credit for the refinement of these images, but we need no technical understanding of their origins to be struck by what they portray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clouds surrounding Venus have disappeared as radar images reveal a terrain of sharp-edged ridges, volcanic craters, petrified lava flows and delicate striations -- testimony to a relentlessly active geographical furnace. We see the blue copperish haze of a Martian sunset -- not the invention of a painter of a child's bubble-gum cards but the actual scene from the planet's surface, a small sun penetrating the atmosphere's powdery dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturn is photographed as if by a tourist who can't get enough shots of the Eiffel Tower, though now the viewer only wishes there were more. It is as if the material world had been left behind for a realm of eerie golden textures, delicately shaded rings and suspended threads of light. Jupiter, in all its immensity, is almost eclipsed by the impression left by its tiny moon Europa, which has a surface like the skin of an aged man's skull, seeming almost transparent, showing veins beneath thin flesh, its crusts and ridges the relics of ancient forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some images -- umbilical coils of roiling fire from the surface of the Sun or Martian dunes with dark spots marking the melting of carbon-dioxide frost -- almost appear to be abstractions, bearing little resemblance to anything familiar. As for Earth seen from space, even that sight is presented anew, the planet outlined by a glowing crescent of reflected sunlight hitting clouds above the South Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These photographs offer an implicit chastisement to the wild pop sci-fi imaginings of the past, but they are also fulfillments of the same urge to know what lies beyond our gravity-bound grasp. They are records of unusual ventures, magnificently achieved: they were taken by unmanned space probes and beamed back to Earth. These contraptions may not carry human life, but they are instruments of the extended human will and imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have sent these probing eyes catapulting in long orbits, sweeping past planets and their moons (as with the Galileo or Cassini missions), or (as with the Mars rovers) stubbornly exploring the planetary surface, or (as with Voyager 2) ultimately veering outward in silent millennial journeys through deep space. Arthur C. Clarke, after looking at some of these photographs, wrote in a foreword to Mr. Benson's 2003 book (''Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes,'' Abrams), ''These images serve as a spectacular reaffirmation that we are privileged to live in the greatest age of exploration the world has ever known.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is a strange kind of exploration because so little of it reveals any human presence. These images have not only been captured by robotic probes, they also show (unlike those early sci-fi pictures) barren worlds. We are looking at fearsomely beautiful realms that seem to preclude life and disdain the human. Whatever their character -- ranging from the swirling random currents of Jupiter's atmosphere to the draftsmanlike elegance of Uranus surrounded by a scarcely visible halo of slight rings -- the harsh majesty seems to leave no room for a living presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet these are photographs. They present themselves to us as records of the real. They show us landscapes that the human eye might conceivably see. But we know too that they depict something we might never see. And some landscapes (like the surfaces of the Sun) we could never see. This mixture of the real and the imagined, along with these works' humanly inspired inhuman origins, conspire to create a strange photographic universe in which the human is everywhere implicated but nowhere sensed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though these pictures were captured without human intervention, almost none would look the way they do without elaborate human tinkering. Though they are photographs, they are not snapshots. Most at this exhibition would not exist without Mr. Benson's aesthetic labors; they are, in part, his creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is where this record becomes even more knotty. We have all, by now, seen the astonishing photographs from the Hubble Telescope with their vibrant portrayals of colliding galaxies and giant star clusters. You see similar moving images on planetarium domes: full-color displays of exploding crimson or yellow accompanied by sub-wooferish whooshes of sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, the colors are as phony as the sound. The Hubble pictures are all in black and white; colors are imposed to approximate hues suggested by frequency data. These tints are often exaggerated for dramatic effect or to create contrast. Even the image creators acknowledge they may not resemble what an eye in galactic space might see. Many are colorized far more radically than any 1930s movie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson is more rigorous because he takes the human eye as a guide; he wants to show us what the eye would see if only it could. He immersed himself in the raw photo Web databases of NASA and the European Space Agency and then got to work, selecting, cropping, matching, shifting. He explains his approach in his book ''Beyond'' and on his Web site, but this should be demonstrated in the exhibition in far more detail; we really don't know how much was done to each image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black-and-white moon pictures from lunar orbiters of 1966 and '67, for example, originated on 70-millimeter film that was developed aboard the craft itself, then scanned and transmitted to Earth. What came back were not stunning vistas but scans of film strips. Fragmentary images had to be matched, gaps filled in, contrast adjusted. Many later pictures are also created out of mosaics: one view of Jupiter and Europa from 1979 was put together out of 60 pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Color was also an issue, as with the Hubble. ''Almost all of these photographs,'' Mr. Benson writes, ''required substantial amounts of digital processing. Many had never been rendered into color before, or if they had they'd long since vanished.'' In general, whether a spacecraft used video technology or digital sensors, three successive shots were taken in black and white, each using a different frequency filter, so color information might later be deduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the camera might be whipping by a planet at 35,000 miles per hour, these three raw images might not perfectly match. So Mr. Benson and his colleague, a planetary scientist and imagery expert, Paul Geissler, transformed them so they could be superimposed and used to create color pictures. In some cases color information was unavailable and had to be inferred from another mission's shots of the same landscape. The show's panoramic glimpse of a Martian dust storm, Mr. Benson explained in an e-mail message, took him months of work, drawing on about 100 images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is amazing that this process is as invisible as it seems here, and the results encourage trust in Mr. Benson's and Mr. Geissler's judgments. ''The solar system is already spectacular enough,'' Mr. Benson writes, ''without pumping artificial colors into it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course he is still creating many of these photographs out of data that would be far less impressive in its raw form. So these works are as much a record of Mr. Benson's explorations as the spacecraft's. And the care in which they are made ensures that however inhospitable to human visitation these worlds may seem, the pictures are a reminder of the crucial presence of human passion and perception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when American plans for human space travel seem to be at a standstill and NASA's mission confused, these haunting images captured by robotic probes paradoxically suggest that this won't truly be a great age of exploration until, despite harshness, costs and challenges, we again see the importance of human experience in space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of two critical cooling systems aboard the International Space Station malfunctioned late on Saturday, setting off alarms and triggering an extensive reduction in power. Mission managers gave tentative approval on Sunday to plans for a complex two-spacewalk repair job late this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling system, which dissipates heat generated by the lab's electronics, initially shut down around 8 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday when a circuit breaker tripped, setting off warning alarms that awoke the crew. With reduced cooling, flight controllers were forced to shut down two of the space station's four stabilizing gyroscopes, used to help control the lab's orientation; one communications channel; and several computer control units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station's flight engineers, Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army and Tracy E. Caldwell Dyson, also had to install jumpers between the Russian Zarya propulsion module and the United States segment of the station to prevent additional cooling problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said the station's six-member crew -- including a third American, Shannon Walker, and three Russians, the commander Aleksandr Skvortsov, Mikhail Kornienko and Fyodor Yurchikhin -- was not in any immediate danger. But the loss of a cooling system will cripple station operations until the problem can be resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By tomorrow, a little bit later on, hopefully we'll be able to send you up a little bit better idea of where we stand on everything,'' the astronaut James M. Kelly radioed from Mission Control shortly before the astronauts returned to bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few hours later, the alarms blared again when flight controllers tried to restart the stalled coolant pump. Once again, a circuit breaker blew, indicating a problem with the pump module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the morning, one of the two powered-down gyroscopes was reactivated. Although the station's main switching units, which direct power to various subsystems, were running a bit hotter than normal, engineers said the laboratory was in a stable configuration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station is equipped with two independent cooling systems, or coolant loops, mounted on the lab's main solar power truss. While the loops are independent, the station cannot operate at full power with just one. Spare components are on board, including two coolant system pumps, but installation is considered difficult and two spacewalks will be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers and managers at the Johnson Space Center gave preliminary approval on Sunday for ''an initial spacewalk no earlier than Thursday by Wheelock and Caldwell Dyson to replace the pump module,'' NASA said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two have not trained for a pump module replacement but had extensive spacewalk training together. The spare 780-pound coolant pump, built by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, is mounted on an external platform just in front of the station's airlock module, relatively close to the faulty pump module. The pump module measures five and a half feet long, a bit more than four feet across and three feet high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repair plan calls for the astronauts to first remove the failed unit, temporarily stow it and then move the new pump into position. The second spacewalk would be devoted to making a variety of electrical connections and hooking up ammonia coolant lines.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dimitar Sasselov, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, lit up the Internet last month with a statement that would stir the soul of anyone who ever dreamed of finding life or another home in the stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brandishing data from NASA's Kepler planet-finding satellite, during a talk at TED Global 2010 in Oxford on July 16, Dr. Sasselov said the mission had discovered 140 Earthlike planets in a small patch of sky in the constellation Cygnus that Kepler has been surveying for the last year and a half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next step after Kepler will be to study the atmospheres of the planets and see if we can find any signs of life,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Dr. Sasselov was busy eating his words. In a series of messages posted on the Kepler Web site Dr. Sasselov acknowledged that should have said ''Earth-sized,'' meaning a rocky body less than three times the diameter of our own planet, rather than ''Earthlike,'' with its connotations of oxygenated vistas of blue and green. He was speaking in geophysics jargon, he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he should have called them ''candidates'' instead of planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Kepler mission is designed to discover Earth-sized planets but it has not yet discovered any; at this time we have found only planet candidates,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: keep on moving, nothing to see here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've heard that a lot lately. Call it the two-sigma blues. Two-sigma is mathematical jargon for a measurement or discovery of some kind that sticks up high enough above the random noise to be interesting but not high enough to really mean anything conclusive. For the record, the criterion for a genuine discovery is known as five-sigma, suggesting there is less than one chance in roughly 3 million that it is wrong. Two sigma, leaving a 2.5 percent chance of being wrong, is just high enough to jangle the nerves, however, and all of ours have been jangled enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only three weeks ago, rumors went flashing around all the way to Gawker that researchers at Fermilab in Illinois had discovered the Higgs boson, a celebrated particle that is alleged to imbue other particles with mass. The rumored effect was far less than the five-sigma gold standard that would change the world. And when the Fermilab physicists reported on their work in Paris last week, there was still no trace of the long-sought Higgs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists at particle accelerators don't have all the fun. Last winter, physicists worked themselves up into a state of ''serious hysteria,'' in the words of one physicist, over rumors that an experiment at the bottom of an old iron mine in Minnesota had detected the purported sea of subatomic particles known as dark matter, which is thought to make up 25 percent of creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists all over the world tuned into balky Webcasts in December to hear scientists from the team, called the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, give a pair of simultaneous talks at Stanford and Fermilab, and this newspaper held its front page, only to hear that the experiment had detected only two particles, only one more than they would have expected to find by chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We all went to bed that night in the same world in which we had woken up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One culprit here is the Web, which was invented to foster better communication among physicists in the first place, but has proved equally adept at spreading disinformation. But another, it seems to me, is the desire for some fundamental discovery about the nature of the universe -- the yearning to wake up in a new world -- and a growing feeling among astronomers and physicists that we are in fact creeping up on enormous changes with the advent of things like the Large Hadron Collider outside Geneva and the Kepler spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't say what the discovery of dark matter or the final hunting down of the Higgs boson would do for the average person, except to paraphrase Michael Faraday, the 19th-century English chemist who discovered the basic laws of electromagnetism. When asked the same question about electricity, he said that someday it would be taxable. Nothing seemed further from everyday reality once upon a time than Einstein's general theory of relativity, the warped space-time theory of gravity, but now it is at the heart of the GPS system, without which we are increasingly incapable of navigating the sea or even the sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest benefit from answering these questions -- what is the universe made of, or where does mass come from -- might be better questions. Cosmologists have spent the last century asking how and when the universe began and will end or how many kinds of particles and forces are needed to make it tick, but maybe we should wonder why it is we feel the need to think in terms of beginnings and endings or particles at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for planets, I no longer expect to see boots on Mars before I die, but I do expect to know where there is a habitable, really Earthlike planet or planets, thanks to Kepler and the missions that are to succeed it. If such planets exist within a few light-years of here, I can imagine pressure building to send a probe, a robot presumably, to investigate. It would be a trip that would take ages and would be for the ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a deadline of sorts for Kepler in the form of a conference in December. By then, said William J. Borucki, Kepler's leader, the team hopes to have moved a bunch of those candidate planets to the confirmed list. They will not be habitable, he warned, noting that that would require water, which would require an orbit a moderate distance from their star that takes a year or so to go around. With only 43 days' worth of data to analyze yet, only planets with tighter, faster and hotter orbits will have shown up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They'll be smaller, but they will be hot,'' Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler has three more years to find a habitable planet. The real point of Dr. Sasselov's talk was that we are approaching a Copernican moment, in which astronomy and biology could combine to tell us something new about our place in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know that science does not exist just to fulfill my science-fiction fantasies, but still I wish that things would speed up, and the ratio of discovery to hopeful noise would go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardly a week goes by, for example, that I don't hear some kind of rumor that, if true, would rock the Universe As We Know It. Recently I heard a rumor that another dark matter experiment, which I won't name, had seen an interesting signal. I contacted the physicist involved. He said the results were preliminary and he had nothing to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smart guy. Very.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>733 words</div><div>3 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three specks of matter captured by the NASA spacecraft Stardust may be stardust that has just entered our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have all the hallmarks of interstellar dust,'' said Andrew Westphal of the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Westphal reported the first speck in March, and he described the second and third on Friday at a meeting of the Meteoritical Society in Manhattan. Each speck is about one-25,000th of an inch across.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third is particularly intriguing. It is rich in carbon, raising the possibility that it is full of the molecules that could serve as the building blocks for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stardust's primary mission was to bring back bits of a comet that it passed in 2004, but scientists also hoped that it would also trap some interstellar particles within a wispy concoction known as aerogel that served as a cosmic dust collector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft completed its seven-year ride through the solar system in 2006 and, as it swung past Earth, detached a capsule containing the collected particles, which parachuted down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then -- with help from an army of amateur researchers -- scientists began the painstaking process of distinguishing the interstellar specks from ordinary solar-system dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a car in a snowstorm, the solar system is flying through a cloud of interstellar gas at 55,000 miles an hour, so stardust enters from one particular direction. By analyzing the directions from which particles strike the aerogel, scientists can determine which ones are from the interstellar cloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Dr. Westphal said the prospect of locating the interstellar dust particles was initially hopeless. ''It's kind of the equivalent of trying to find 50 ants on a football field,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead -- ''totally out of desperation,'' he said -- the scientists turned to non-experts around the world to sift through thousands of images. Today, about 29,000 people -- or ''dusters,'' as they call themselves -- take part in the Stardust@Home project, which Dr. Westphal directs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interspersed test images allow the researchers to check how well the dusters are doing, and the dusters compete for the top scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first presumed interstellar particle -- actually two distinct pieces -- was found by a Canadian duster, Bruce Hudson, who retired as a carpenter and groundskeeper after a stroke. Mr. Hudson said he had looked through 25,000 images, spending as much as 5 to 10 hours a day at it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You get so caught up in it,'' he said. He named the two pieces Orion and Sirius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second was discovered by Naomi Wordsworth, a circuit designer in England, who heard about Stardust@Home from a BBC television program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought it was a wonderful opportunity for anyone to become involved with real space research and I joined straight away,'' Mrs. Wordsworth said. ''Although I spend my working days in front of a computer solving problems and verifying designs, I found it was quite relaxing to look through the photos and concentrate on the visual images.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She named her speck Hylabrook, after the name of her parents' house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers have yet to check their database to identify the person who turned up the carbon-rich third particle, which turned up only two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the scientists have a rough breakdown of the chemical elements in the dust specks, based on X-ray imaging, but they do not know much else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are deliberately not doing as much analysis as we could,'' Dr. Westphal said. ''Our great-grandchildren would curse us if we ruin these things. We're immensely aware if we drop one on the floor, it would cost $300 million'' -- roughly the cost of the Stardust mission -- ''to get another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They still cannot say for certain that the three are interstellar particles. To do that, they would have to risk extracting the bits from the aerogel and analyze the oxygen isotopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For reasons not understood, the solar system has a higher percentage of oxygen-18 relative to oxygen-17. If the particles are indeed from beyond the solar system, their oxygen isotopes would contain the lower amounts seen elsewhere.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With research on the International Space Station curtailed to save power, two astronauts are scheduled to venture out early Friday to begin repairs on a cooling system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the spacewalk, the station's flight engineers, Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army and Tracy E. Caldwell Dyson, are to disconnect and remove a large, unwieldy 780-pound pump, which failed on Saturday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be a tricky choreography for the two crew members to do,'' Courtenay McMillan, the spacewalk flight director, said in a news conference Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that goes well, they will conduct a second spacewalk, set for Monday, to install a spare pump stored on the outside of the station. It has four spare pumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an anomaly we knew someday would happen,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, the space station manager. ''It's an anomaly that we have trained for. This is an anomaly we have planned for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Wheelock and Ms. Caldwell Dyson had been scheduled to perform a spacewalk on Thursday to outfit a Russian module for future robotics work and to make preparations for the installation of an American module. That work has been postponed, but it allowed quick planning for the repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The malfunction left the space station with only one of two critical cooling systems operating, and some experiments and activities have been curtailed to reduce the cooling needs and prepare for the coming spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three Russian and three American astronauts are in no immediate danger, but if the remaining cooling system also broke down, they would have to rely heavily on systems in the Russian part of the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a significant failure though in terms of systems onboard I.S.S., and so it's one we need to get after,'' Mr. Suffredini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials originally planned the spacewalk for Thursday, but they delayed it a day for additional preparation.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>982 words</div><div>4 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a cooling-system pump on the International Space Station broke down over the weekend, NASA and the six astronauts on board responded with typical cool self-assurance. The space agency scheduled two spacewalks to repair the damage and said the astronauts, three Americans and three Russians, were in no danger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the incident underlined a deeper concern about the orbiting station's long-term health. If this or any other problem should result in a need to abandon the station, the United States' human spaceflight program would lose one of its last remaining reasons for being.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, the 12-year-old space station was an afterthought in the multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to return people to the Moon and possibly push off to Mars. But in the shifting priorities under the Obama administration, the station has become a keystone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only is it supposed to serve as a scientific laboratory and an example of successful international collaboration, the administration also wants it to provide a market to nurture a commercial space industry for launching people and cargo into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a much more central role in this decade under the Obama plan than it did under the Bush plan,'' said John M. Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Moon program, known as Constellation, has been hamstrung. Although pieces of it could survive in bills under consideration in Congress, it remains unclear what rockets NASA is to build, what their destinations would be and how long it would take to get there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the space station, NASA's financing of commercial rockets to take crew and cargo there would almost certainly evaporate. And without government financing, companies would be unlikely to invest billions of dollars to pursue a speculative market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no question it's a risky business strategy,'' said James A. M. Muncy, a space policy consultant who supports the Obama space policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, the current director of the Space Policy Institute, said abandoning the station might even mark the end of the human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My concern,'' he said, ''is without an overarching political impetus, the energy to restart a human spaceflight program would be very hard to achieve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Congressional aide, who was not authorized to speak for attribution, said, ''You're in a position where we were in 1962, where you don't have a place to go.'' With the remaining space shuttles to be retired next year, he said, ''you don't even have a launch vehicle that can travel to low-Earth orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling problem, which has limited research aboard the space station so equipment does not overheat, is only the latest glitch to befall it. In the past, navigation computers have crashed, a rotating joint on the solar arrays started grinding and vibrating, and the toilets have not always worked. In each case, engineers identified the problem and found a solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I.S.S. is a living, breathing beast,'' Michael T. Suffredini, the space station manager, said in an interview last month. ''Some days everything doesn't exactly work perfectly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, NASA officials say that over all the station is in good shape, even as its lifetime is being extended five years, to 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, in preparation for life after the space shuttle, NASA has launched as many of the large spare parts as it could and stored them on the outside of the station. The station has four spare pumps of the type that failed Saturday, and managers said they had planned for exactly this type of failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suffredini said that only a radiator was too large to fit into any spacecraft other than the shuttle, and that piece is to fly up on the next shuttle mission in November. Equipment on the station has also been lasting longer than predicted, he said, adding, ''If we get thrown curveballs along the way, we have time to react to them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling pump was an exception: Expected to last 100,000 hours (more than 11 years), it failed after only about 80,000 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the shuttles, it will not be possible to bring parts back to Earth for diagnosis and repair. That could be significant for something like the pump. There is no room to bring the faulty pump back on the next two shuttle missions, but it could be brought back on an additional flight that is likely to be added to the schedule for next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threat of a collision with micrometeoroids is small, but not zero. Mr. Suffredini said the chances of a strike severe enough to require evacuation were about 1 in 100 over a six-month period. Over 10 years, the cumulative risk is nearly 1 in 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate bill outlining the budgets and goals for NASA for the next three years asks the space agency to conduct a detailed study to ensure that it is prepared for operating the station until 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recent breakdown of the station's cooling system emphasizes how critical it is that we understand all of the equipment needs the space station will have as its service life is extended,'' Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, who pushed for that provision, said in a statement. ''We must assure that NASA has a plan to deliver those elements or bring parts down for analysis and repair once the space shuttle is finally retired.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate bill also calls for refurbishing an additional shuttle fuel tank, which leaves the door open for at least one more shuttle flight if it becomes necessary.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacewalk to replace a broken coolant pump on the International Space Station has been delayed another day to Saturday morning. NASA officials said the additional day was needed to finish details and gave the space walkers a day to review the plans. A second spacewalk, to finish hooking up the replacement pump has also been pushed back, to Wednesday. The pump, which broke last Saturday, moves ammonia coolant through a loop on the outside of the space station, one of two such cooling loops. Until the pump repairs are complete, the station is operating with reduced power to avoid overheating, and scientific research has been curtailed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unexpected ammonia leaks and a jammed quick-disconnect fitting derailed a marathon eight-hour spacewalk Saturday to replace a coolant system pump aboard the International Space Station, forcing the astronauts to delay the repairs until a second excursion Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael T. Suffredini, manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said he was ''disappointed'' the astronauts ran into the unexpected snag, saying a third spacewalk likely will be needed to resolve the leak and bring a replacement pump on line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ammonia QDs are known to be sensitive systems,'' he said referring to the quick-disconnect fittings. ''They're very complicated; it's very high-pressure ammonia you have to try to be able to disconnect and reconnect on a regular basis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will get thorugh this problem,'' he said. ''The challenge is to get through this problem before the next problem hits the other cooling system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pump shorted out last Saturday, knocking one of the lab's two ammonia coolant systems out of action and forcing the six-member crew to reduce power usage throughout the station to keep critical equipment from overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Expedition 24 crew was not in any immediate danger, but the reduced power meant an interruption of scientific research and left the lab one failure away from a major cooling problem that could, in a worst-case scenario, force the crew to evacuate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Army Col. Douglas H. Wheelock, making his fourth spacewalk, and Tracy Caldwell Dyson, making her first, originally planned a seven-hour excursion to disconnect four coolant system lines and five electrical cables. They then hoped to remove the failed pump and install a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally, the spacewalk on Wednesday was to reconnect the ammonia coolant lines and finish any work that did not get done Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday, the initial stages of the spacewalk went smoothly, and the first of the four coolant lines was disconnected without incident. But the astronauts ran into major problems releasing a quick-disconnect fitting on the second line, known as M3. After initially opening the mechanism, Colonel Wheelock reported a clearly visible ammonia leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see little sparklets of ammonia coming from the line,'' he observed. He then was told to close the mechanism in a bid to seal the leak, but he was unable to reopen the latch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling well behind schedule, Colonel Wheelock and Dr. Dyson pressed ahead and had no problems disconnecting the two remaining coolant lines. One of those, along with the first line to be removed, was plugged into a so-called jumper box to help maintain the proper pressure inside the coolant lines as the station moves into and out of sunlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making one final attempt to release the jammed M3 connector, Colonel Wheelock finally coaxed it open by lightly hammering on the mechanism. But the leak reappeared and a shower of ammonia ice crystals could be seen breaking off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Wheelock retightened the quick-disconnect fitting and left the line in place before heading back to the station's airlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of exposure to a toxic material, the astronauts had to delay re-entering the station to give any residual ammonia on their suits time to evaporate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRAPHICS: Work on the Cooling System: Over the course of two spacewalks, one on Saturday and one scheduled for Wednesday, astronauts aboard the International Space Station plan to replace a failed ammonia pump module with a spare that is stored on a nearby platform.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who thinks astronauts ply a glamorous trade would do well to read Mary Roach's ''Packing for Mars.'' The book is an often hilarious, sometimes queasy-making catalog of the strange stuff devised to permit people to survive in an environment for which their bodies are stupendously unsuited. Roach eases us into the story, with an anecdote that reveals the cultural differences among spacefaring nations. In Japan, psychologists evaluate astronaut candidates by, among other things, their ability to fold origami cranes swiftly under stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, however, Roach has left all decorum behind. With an unflinching eye for repellent details, she launches readers into the thick of spaceflight's grossest engineering challenges: disposing of human waste, controlling body odor without washing, and containing nausea -- or, if containment fails, surviving a spacewalk with a helmet full of perilously acidic upchuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a wry account, Roach herself braves motion sickness on NASA's ''Vomit Comet,'' a C-9 transport plane modified to fly in parabolas -- the only means of experiencing weightlessness outside of orbit. Its cabin is padded, and on its upward path, passengers are pressed against the floor with a force of roughly twice their body weight. But over the parabola's crest and during the half-minute journey downward, fliers ''rise up off the floor like spooks from a grave.'' Having taken Scop-Dex, NASA's anti-motion-sickness drug, Roach is euphoric. Other passengers -- NASA regulars call them ''kills'' -- are not so fortunate. Violently ill, they have had to be belted into their seats. ''It's like the Rapture in here every 30 seconds,'' Roach declares. ''Weightlessness is like heroin, or how I imagine heroin must be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heroin imagery, I suspect, has as much to do with the motion-sickness meds as with the microgravity. They are a potent combination of scopolamine (an anti-emetic sedative) and dextroamphetamine (a stimulant).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quoting the astronaut Jim Lovell, Roach exposes NASA's untold sanitation woes. The Gemini 7 mission, he says, was ''like spending two weeks in a latrine.'' Roach appears to have combed every mission transcript from the 1960s and '70s for scatological references. The astronauts in ''Packing for Mars'' don't say prim things like ''Houston, we have a problem.'' While on the moon, sitting inside the Apollo 16 lunar module with the astronaut Charlie Duke, John Young blurts: ''I got the farts again. I got 'em again, Charlie. I don't know what the hell gives them to me.'' Roach devotes careful attention to the design of Apollo's ''fecal bag,'' a clumsy receptacle into which germicide had to be manually massaged. In contrast, she portrays the Johnson Space Center's suction toilet as a technological triumph, although docking with its tiny aperture can be a challenge -- requiring ground-based practice on a ''Positional Trainer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admirers of ''Stiff,'' Roach's droll report on the ways that science has used cadavers, will be pleased that ''Packing for Mars'' also contains post-mortem high jinks. The engineering team for the Orion spacecraft (a project scaled back by President Obama) couldn't gather adequate collision data from mere crash dummies, so the team used dead people. In a wonderfully slapstick scene, Roach describes the engineers' efforts to insert a freshly thawed cadaver into a spacecraft mock-up: ''Think of wrestling a comatose drunk into a taxicab.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, fans of ''Bonk,'' her look at the science of sex, will enjoy her relentless inquiry into off-planet mating. When it comes to graphic details, Roach elicits amazing confidences. NASA, she learns, doesn't expect a celibate Mars crew, but one that will ''mix and match or whatever.'' Roach persuades a Russian astronaut to explain ground control's reason for nixing his request for a blowup sex doll: ''We would need to put it in your schedule for the day.'' And a bone-loss-study participant, forced to lie in bed for three months to simulate the effect of weightlessness on his skeleton, divulges where and how study participants conduct their autoerotic lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when I thought there was no question Roach wouldn't ask, and no subject she wouldn't broach, one appeared: emotion. Or, more specifically, grief. While camping on Devon Island, a remote outpost in the High Arctic of Canada, Roach interviews Jon Clark, a flight surgeon who helped investigate the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster. He details for Roach how bodies break apart at high speeds. Then she realizes: he is the widower of the astronaut Laurel Clark, who died on Columbia. Roach -- and the reader -- want desperately to know how he coped with the loss, and how he continued to do this grisly work. But she refuses to find out: ''It seemed insensitive to ask.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happily, Roach does not dwell on Lisa Nowak, the astronaut who drove from Texas to Florida, allegedly in diapers, to confront her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend. She does, however, point out that male astronauts have a diaper alternative that fits directly onto their anatomy. In the way of <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, where a small is termed a ''tall,'' the men's devices come only in L, XL and XXL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a long-duration Mars trip, urine would have to be recycled, which is not as vile as it sounds. ''I will tell you sincerely and without exaggeration that the best part of lunch today at the NASA Ames cafeteria is the urine,'' Roach writes, adding that after purification and desalination, it tastes like Karo syrup. Her husband, however, doesn't share her keenness and protests when she stores her urine in their refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest parts of ''Packing for Mars'' chart the American space effort during the cold war. Roach deals less knowingly with the situation today, when space is, as the private entrepreneurs say, a place, not a program. While investigating zero-gravity sex, she mentions that Robert Bigelow, the founder of Budget Suites America, plans to build an orbiting hotel. But she doesn't convey that NASA itself has begun spurning Big Aerospace boondoggles (like Orion) in favor of shoestring alternatives (a contract with tiny, upstart <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for cargo flights to the International Space Station).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as Roach refuses to grapple with grief, she also plays down spaceflight's greatest danger: radiation, for which no cost-efficient shielding has yet been engineered. Linked to brain damage and rapid-onset leukemia, it could quickly devastate a Mars crew. In contrast to excrement and sex, which have dedicated chapters, radiation surfaces in a scattershot, piecemeal fashion. Roach states that astronauts are classified as ''radiation workers'' because they receive such high doses. She tells us that cosmic rays -- high-energy heavy ions from outside our solar system -- can be damaging to cells, and that hydrogen compounds (not metal spacecraft hulls) are required for shielding. But she never directly addresses the radiation from solar flares, and makes a joke about a brilliant idea that, in my view, deserves a chapter of its own: on a Mars mission, the astronauts' solid waste (rich in hydrocarbons) could be wrapped around the crew quarters to protect against cosmic rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the book's end, after more than 300 pages of debunking the romance of spaceflight, Roach herself buys into that idea, making a misguided, emotional pitch for a $500 billion human Mars mission -- at the expense of cheap, reliable, robotic missions. I am not impervious to sentimentality. I felt a surge of tenderness when Roach described the ''unlikely heroics'' of a patch of moss on Devon Island: ''something so delicate surviving in a place so stingy and hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet compared with the irradiated void of space, a frozen rock in the High Arctic is as cozy as a baby's crib. Packing for Mars, Roach has shown, can be entertaining here on Earth. But no way are humans ready to make the actual trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 29, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A brief report in the Inside the List column last Sunday about Mary Roach's ''Packing for Mars,'' a book on the ways humans adapt to space travel, misstated the location of a toilet equipped with a closed-circuit camera used as a training aid for astronauts. It is at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, not on the space shuttle.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PACKING FOR MARS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Curious Science of Life in the Void</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mary Roach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 334 pages. <span class="companylink">W. W. Norton &amp;Company</span>. $25.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In conducting research into the physiology of astronauts in space, Mary Roach found out that one man on a Space Shuttle flight wore a sound monitor on his belly for the duration of his voyage. It is Ms. Roach's style to be less interested in the belly-noise findings than in the freaky-deaky part of the story. ''Don't feel bad for him,'' she writes in ''Packing for Mars'' about that awkwardly wired astronaut. ''Feel bad for the Air Force security guy assigned to listen to two weeks of bowel sounds to be sure no conversations including classified information had been inadvertently recorded.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Roach has already written zealously nosy books about corpses (''Stiff''), copulation (''Bonk'') and charlatans (''Spook''). Each time, what has interested her most is the fringe material: exotic footnotes, smart one-liners, bizarre quasi-scientific phenomena. Yet her fluffily lightweight style is at its most substantial -- and most hilarious -- in the zero-gravity realm that ''Packing for Mars'' explores. Here's why: The topic of astronauts' bodily functions provides as good an excuse to ask rude questions as you'll find on this planet or any other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be only slightly unfair to say that Ms. Roach's main focus in ''Packing for Mars'' is scatological. She's interested in borderline mental states too. (''If you carry a bathroom scale to the top of Mount Everest,'' she says, ''you may see that you actually weigh a tiny bit less, not counting the marbles you have obviously lost.'') She also cares about the linguistic acrobatics used by space scientists when they address things they don't want to talk about. A stricture against astronauts' sharing ''undue preferential treatment'' is NASA's way of banning sex in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she cares about one-of-a-kind efforts like the one that the North American Vexillological Association studies in her book's first chapter. Obviously Ms. Roach would have done anything to work the word vexillological into her reporting, and in this case it wasn't even a stretch. Vexillology is the scholarly study of flags. This group analyzed NASA's engineering efforts to plant a flag on the Moon despite an absence of flag-fluttering wind (no atmosphere), extreme heat (2,000-degrees Fahrenheit generated by the nearby descent engine) and a lack of flag-anchoring Moon topsoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's about as serious as ''Packing for Mars'' gets. Ms. Roach is much more enthralled by scientists' curious and curiouser efforts to replicate space conditions on Earth as they analyze every last quirk of the human body. Here's a book that will tell you exactly how bad a stuffy space capsule can smell (''different from the fresh ocean breezes outside,'' the astronaut Jim Lovell tells her, recalling comments made by frogmen who opened the Gemini VII hatch after splashdown) and what happens when astronauts can't bathe for long periods of time. In a book full of smooth segues and clever chapter headings, this section is called ''Houston, We Have a Fungus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chapter called ''The Horizontal Stuff'' is devoted to human guinea pigs who spend months in bed so that the deterioration of immobilized bodies can be studied. One such ''terranaut'' tells Ms. Roach that he loves the meals he's given, particularly the Jell-O. And ''One Furry Step for Mankind'' tells about chimps sent into space. Because Ms. Roach confides every last aspect of her adventures, she describes being sent to what she calls a ''PCLP,'' or Person in Charge of Lying to the Press, when seeking chimp-in-space information. On the grave of Ham, designated the ''World's First Astrochimp,'' she finds both a basket of flowers and a plastic banana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good story. But that's not what Ms. Roach's readers will be chuckling about. The wildest parts of her book involve various forms of human egesta, which is one of her favorite new words. (Another is steatorrhea.) Suffice it to say that for every measurable aspect of human digestion there is a scientist to quantify it, sometimes with a name like Nevin S. Scrimshaw (the benefits of a liquid formula diet) or Kanapathipillai Wignarajah, called Wiggy (human fecal simulants). Some research devoted to astronauts is not as different from commercial diaper testing as you would think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Ms. Roach has shown in earlier books, particularly ''Bonk,'' she is completely embarrassment proof. There is no biological situation she will not visualize, no anatomical question she will not ask. So ''Packing for Mars'' is as startling as it is funny, even if its strategic aim is to tell you more than you need to know. ''The report didn't mention anal leakage, but I will,'' she writes about test results on food cubes proposed for astronauts' use. The cubes did not pass muster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As ever, Ms. Roach finds her best material in unexpected places. When she experiences zero gravity on a McDonnell Douglas C-9 military transport jet (better known as the Vomit Comet, though NASA's preferred phrase is Weightless Wonder), she comes back with notes that say ''WOO'' and ''yippee.'' When she rises off the floor and floats, she thinks, ''It's like the Rapture in here every 30 seconds.'' Then she stows away these memories until, later in the book, she considers the implications of zero gravity for porn films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes someone with Ms. Roach's dedication to look at one star in what's supposed to be space and realize that the actress is faking it. This isn't zero gravity. ''Her ponytail is hanging down her back,'' Ms. Roach writes, ''and other things are hanging down her front.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long discussion of water on the Moon, a new study contradicts some recent reports that say the Moon had water at the time of its formation. A group of researchers reports in the journal Science that when the Moon was created, some 4.5 billion years ago, there was not much hydrogen on it, and therefore no water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers determined this by analyzing chlorine isotopes found in lunar rock samples from Apollo missions. The range of chlorine isotopes in lunar samples was 25 times that found in samples from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Moon had significant levels of hydrogen, as Earth did, this range would have been far less, said Zachary D. Sharp, a scientist in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico and the study's lead author.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chlorine would have bonded with hydrogen, forming compounds like hydrogen chloride, and escaped from the Moon's surface, he said. The abundance of chlorine points to a lack of hydrogen and water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The amount of water on the Moon was way too low for life to have ever have possibly have existed there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most scientists believe the Moon was formed when a large object struck Earth, breaking off a chunk that has since orbited Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, goes one theory, water was released as steam from molten basalts over time, eventually forming bodies of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''An understanding of whether the Moon was dry or wet will help us understand how water appeared on Earth,'' Dr. Sharp said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the sun sets over the Atacama Desert in Chile each reliably cloudless night, dazzling ruby red and garnet hues paint the volcanic Andes Mountain peaks in the eastern skyline, deepening almost imperceptibly until they are indistinguishable from black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would be the grand finale at many resort areas. But here, it is merely the opening act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the nearest star had set one evening last August, I peered through the Meade 16-inch telescope in the 15-foot observatory of the Hotel de Larache in San Pedro de Atacama to see the main attraction: the doppelganger Alpha Centauri stars that, without the benefit of magnification, look like one; the misty, yellow Swan Nebula; and the Scorpio Constellation's bi-winged Butterfly Cluster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This remote desert, roughly 800 miles north of Santiago, offers some of the clearest views of the Milky Way in the world, making it a natural home to a cluster of high-tech research observatories used by international astronomers. With the opening of a mini-observatory at Hotel de Larache two years ago and several other resort stargazing programs, it has also become a vacation spot for amateur stargazers like me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resorts at Atacama are no outliers. Stargazing has increasingly become an alternative to traditional after-sundown dining and drinking at hotels and resorts. Call it night life for nerds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For people who live in the cities -- and more than half the world's population does -- the only way to see the stars in safety and in comfort without worrying about what might happen in the dark is at a resort,'' said Rick Fienberg, a spokesman for the American Astronomical Society, based in Washington. He noted that the International Year of Astronomy in 2009, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the first use of a telescope by Galileo Galilei, brought out millions of people around the world for stargazing events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first encountered stargazing tourism several years ago at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa in Hawaii, a 40-acre resort with sweeping views of Kaanapali Beach. Instead of drinking mai tais at the bar or attending a luau, I joined Eddie Mahoney, an astronomer, who led our group of 12 to the roof of the hotel's nine-story main building. The relatively high perch and resort lighting -- designed to angle down rather than shine up -- preserved the dark setting for his three 50-minute nightly public stargazing sessions ($25 a person).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mahoney oriented us by pointing out the North Star, the Big and Little Dippers and the constellation Orion, all visible to the naked eye, of course. But what appeared to be a fuzzy cluster in the sky became clear with binoculars: they were the seven stars in the Pleiades Group. And moving to the 16-inch reflector telescope, far-off planets come into the sharp focus you see in Hubble Space Telescope images: Saturn and its rings, as well as a quartet of Jupiter's moons precisely lined up beside it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly in possession of a 14-inch computerized telescope, Mr. Mahoney still leads stargazing sessions, which he started 10 years ago. Some 6,000 gazers a year take his sky tour, according to the resort management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing light pollution and caring for a planet is an undercurrent of his talks. ''I remind them that Earth is a starship, and we are just passing through,'' said Mr. Mahoney, who distributes -- what else? -- Starburst or Milky Way candies after the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of floating through the galaxy is underscored in the western United States, where low population density and favorable weather combine to make for particularly starry skies. At Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort near Truckee, Calif., Tony Berendsen of Tahoe Star Tours leads summer stargazing programs that merge science and the arts, incorporating poetry readings, string quartet concerts and talks by a visiting astrophysicist. Near Scottsdale, Ariz., the Boulders Resort abjures the science of astronomy in favor of the lore of astrology in its ''Dining With the Stars'' dinners held three times each year, on the summer solstice and the spring and fall equinox dates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had a chance to stargaze out west firsthand this spring during a visit to Colorado. After a day of whitewater kayaking I took part in a decidedly low-tech session at the new Viceroy Snowmass, an opulent 173-room resort on the Snowmass ski slopes near Aspen. Instead of using an observatory or even a telescope, guests sat around a bonfire on the pool deck, faces facing heavenward as the leader, Marieta Bialek, pointed out constellations and planets visible above the mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the planet Venus shining in the west, the overall order of the night sky emerged as the evening progressed. Taking in the panoramic view of the sky was more meditative than scientific, but rewarding nonetheless, especially when a shooting star streaked by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a mystery and wonder about it,'' said Ms. Bialek, leaning back in her chair to point out the constellation Cassiopeia. ''Many people find comfort in the stars. As things are changing around them, the stars stay steady.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That steadiness was evident in the Atacama region of Chile, where there is little night life to compete with the twinkling sky after dark. Nearby resorts that feature stargazing include Tierra Atacama, a stone's throw from Hotel de Larache, and Alto Atacama lodge, which offers guided stargazing nightly, except during full moon phases that wash out the viewing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stargazing at Hotel de Larache is no mere add-on. On my tour there, several gazers took along Pisco sours from the bar to the fireside orientation involving charts and diagrams before navigating paths to the observatory marked in dim red to minimize light pollution. Inside, the dome opened and swiveled under the computerized direction of the scope as it lined up stars and constellations, which the six of us took turns viewing over the next hour, murmuring oohs and aahs normally associated with fireworks and giving us plenty to marvel at over dinner after the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU GO</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellite companies have been the also-rans of Internet providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They serve a little more than one million customers, most in rural areas that have no other options. Their services can be painfully slow and cost twice as much as high-speed broadband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But two companies, WildBlue and HughesNet, are now in a race to change all that. Both plan to launch satellites in the next couple of years that will dwarf their predecessors in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WildBlue's alone will have 10 times the capacity of its three current satellites combined. Such behemoths, the companies say, will enable them, at prices similar to what they now charge, to provide Internet service at speeds many times faster than they now offer -- as fast, in some cases, as fiber connections. Further, the companies argue, satellites can provide service more easily and cheaply per subscriber than their earthbound cable and phone company competitors, particularly to the 14 million to 24 million Americans who live in areas without broadband service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One advantage satellite has is ubiquity,'' Arunas G. Slekys, vice president for <span class="companylink">Hughes Network Systems</span>, said. ''The cost of reaching you with a satellite dish is independent of where you are. Fiber or cable is labor-intensive and dependent on distance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As to satellite's potential in rural regions, ''clearly, there's an unserved market,'' Mr. Slekys said. ''And it's not as though they have terrestrial or satellite. They only have satellite as a choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with their big, shiny new satellites, the companies will still have to overcome earthly concerns. While the new satellites will transmit signals more quickly, there will continue to be slight delays -- a half a second or so -- on users' computers because the signals have to travel 22,000 miles up into space and back down again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the problem of serving residents who are not able to point a satellite dish toward the satellites' location in the southern skies. And then there's the question of making sure satellite modem dishes are clear of snow in winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the satellite companies contend that they should have received a bigger piece of the $7.2 billion in federal stimulus money for extending broadband service to underserved areas in the United States. Of its $2.5 billion share of the stimulus funds, the Agriculture Department is allocating just $100 million in grants to satellite companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas E. Moore, chief of WildBlue, said satellite technology would be able to serve thousands more rural residents than terrestrial services at a fraction of the cost. He cited a $28 million grant to a nonprofit group in North Carolina to extend fiber to 420 schools and libraries. That same grant could have instead directly served 70,000 residents in North Carolina through satellite service, Mr. Moore said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For every one of those people, there are literally hundreds more who won't have access to stimulus funds,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joseph Freddoso, president of MCNC, the nonprofit group that manages North Carolina's public education technology network, said satellites were not an ideal primary service for his users, who require a more reliable network for their research and data-heavy applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To compare what we do with what satellite does as a service is an apples-to-oranges comparison,'' Mr. Freddoso said, adding that the grant will serve one million students in 37 counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the strides that satellite companies are taking, other Internet service providers are trying to accelerate their services as well. The life span of a satellite is around 15 years, and the complexity of a broadband satellite, which has three times as many components as TV broadcast satellites, has led the industry to evolve at glacial speeds. And satellites, too, are dependent on complicated rocket launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin R. Laverty, a spokesman for Verizon, agreed that laying down fiber optic cable is expensive initially. But once in place, fiber optic networks can be upgraded much more easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fiber optic is virtually an unlimited technology,'' he said. ''All you have to do is change the electronics on either end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Venech, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">Time Warner Cable</span>, says that the speeds his company provides easily surpass even the new offerings from the satellite companies: ''We feel we are strongly positioned to compete against all competitors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite industry has boasted of its capabilities before. In the late 1990s, before the Internet bubble burst, there was a space bubble, said Christopher D. Quilty, a senior vice president in Florida for the investment firm <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp;Associates</span>. ''In the late '90s, there was an overcapacity and overinvestment in everything space.'' He estimated that half a dozen to a dozen satellite broadband initiatives were started globally. ''There were only two surviving projects from that era.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the two, WildBlue, was acquired last December by <span class="companylink">ViaSat Inc</span>., which previously had operations in military, government and commercial satellite communications. The other, HughesNet, is currently operated by <span class="companylink">Hughes Communications</span>. Both are using <span class="companylink">Space Systems/Loral</span> in Palo Alto, Calif., to manufacture their new satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those satellites have more efficient antennas and 100 times the bandwidth of the first-generation broadband satellites 10 years ago, said Christopher F. Hoeber, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">Space Systems/Loral</span>. He said residents will have smaller dishes because the new satellites' smaller beams concentrate energy for a stronger connection, less affected by weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More beams also mean satellite frequencies can be reused more often, allowing for greater capacity. WildBlue's satellite, ViaSat-1, is scheduled to be the first to go into orbit, sometime early next year. HughesNet's satellite, Jupiter, will follow in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hoeber said first-generation broadband satellites did have problems with weather and delayed transmissions. But he said the new generation, the third, had made notable improvements, as would future versions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's a misperception that the broadband service isn't as good as cable or DSL,'' Mr. Hoeber said. ''And it's not true anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while the two new satellites represent a big step forward, they have little ability, once in space, to adapt to changing technology on the ground. In the future, satellites are likely to have more flexibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the first steps in that process, the networking company <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> said it had developed the first router for a commercial satellite. The satellite was launched last November, and <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> announced last month that the router successfully supported communications for its first tester, the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory Pelton, general manager of <span class="companylink">Cisco</span>'s Internet Routing in Space program, said the router would make satellite communications smoother, allowing a satellite call to be made directly without routing on the ground. ''We're making satellite a full member of the Internet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another manufacturer, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, is building two satellites, to be launched within the next year, that will combine terrestrial and satellite networks in the United States for 4G wireless services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, WildBlue's satellite, ViaSat-1, has started a monthlong test in a thermal vacuum meant to simulate space conditions. HughesNet's Jupiter satellite is still being built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Satellite has to evolve at the same rate as terrestrial technologies to be relevant to the market,'' Mr. Moore said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a replacement cooling pump successfully installed Monday, the International Space Station could be back to almost normal by Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two astronauts, Tracy E. Caldwell Dyson and Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army, took their third spacewalk in the past week and a half to move the 780-pound replacement pump into place and connect the coolant and electrical cables. In a quick test, the pump operated properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference after the spacewalk, Kirk Shireman, deputy manager of the space station program, said the station team was looking forward to ''getting back to normal and doing the kinds of work that the space station was meant to accomplish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pump failed on July 31, disabling one of two external cooling systems. The astronauts were never in immediate danger, but a failure in the second cooling system would have put them in a much more difficult situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all continues to go well, the electrical systems will be largely switched back to the usual configuration by Tuesday afternoon. A final jumper cable rerouting power is expected to be removed Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientific research, largely halted because the astronauts were busy on the pump repair and because of power reductions to avoid overheating, is to resume by next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first spacewalk by Colonel Wheelock and Dr. Caldwell Dyson, on Aug. 7, ran into some difficulty with a balky ammonia line. They overcame that on the second spacewalk, last Wednesday, and removed the broken pump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's 7-hour, 20-minute spacewalk proceeded smoothly. The astronauts accomplished all of their tasks except a lower-priority one unrelated to the pump -- to install an extension cord to preserve access to a power outlet. The outlet will become blocked after the attachment of a cargo module that will be brought up by the next space shuttle mission, scheduled for November.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>621 words</div><div>20 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon is shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In making the announcement, scientists were quick to add that the Moon has not shrunk by much, that the shrinking may have occurred over a billion years, and that the Moon will not shrink out of view in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The kind of radius change and shrinking we're describing here is so small that you would never notice it,'' said Thomas R. Watters of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, during a NASA-sponsored telephone news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Watters and his colleagues deduced the Moon's diminishing size from cracks on the surface seen in images taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Moon's core has cooled and contracted, the outer crust fractured into faults, forming ridges as one side of the fracture slid on top of the other. The same cooling and shrinking occurs within all planetary bodies; NASA's Messenger spacecraft recently observed similar -- and much larger -- fractures on the planet Mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest of the Moon ridges is about 300 feet high and stretches for several miles, and some had been seen during the Apollo Moon missions. During Apollo 17, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmidt even drove to one in their lunar rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of the ridges are much smaller and shorter, only tens of yards high, which is why they had escaped notice until the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and its sharp-eyed camera arrived in orbit last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the eons, the shrinkage for the Moon was only about 200 yards, the length of two football fields, out of a diameter of 2,160 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists believe that the ridges are young -- for planetary geologists, a billion years old is young compared with the 4.5-billion-year age of the solar system -- because the ridges cut across small, young craters, but no large craters appear on top of any of the ridges. Large impacts are much rarer and likely to be much more ancient. The ridges also look freshly carved in the moonscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some ridges could be much younger than a billion years, Dr. Watters said, and the shrinking and cracking could be still occurring today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1970s, four seismometers deployed by the Apollo astronauts detected about 30 shallow moonquakes. Dr. Watters said the scientists were looking into the possibility that those moonquakes might have emanated from the newly discovered faults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Wargo, the chief lunar scientist at NASA headquarters, said the findings, which appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science, were more evidence that the Moon was much livelier than its reputation as a cold, unchanging world. ''We're now talking about the Moon in a completely different way,'' Dr. Wargo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A curious lack of older, larger shrinkage cracks may put constraints on current ideas for the origin of the Moon, that it coalesced out of molten wreckage left behind when a Mars-size object slammed into the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Watters said the observations did not argue against the impact theory, but ''our results are really much more consistent with a cooler initial starting temperature for the Moon, a starting temperature that did not allow the entire Moon to melt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: As the lunar interior cooled and contracted, the Moon shrank about 200 yards. As a result its brittle crust ruptured and thrust faults pushed crustal materials up the side of a crater (at arrows) and formed distinctive landforms.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING FOR MARS, I: Mary Roach's jaunty exploration of space travel, ''Packing for Mars,'' plants its flag at No. 6 on the hardcover nonfiction list. Will any astronauts be tossing it in their carry-ons? Some books have been launched into space. Ron Garan, a NASA astronaut who is preparing to fly to the International Space Station in March, has been posting Twitter updates about the books he's taking along, including ''The Blue Sweater: Bridging the Gap Between Rich and Poor in an Interconnected World,'' by Jacqueline Novogratz, and Muhammad Yunus's ''Creating a World Without Poverty.'' He may also find some books left behind by previous travelers, including Goethe's ''Faust'' and Robert A. Heinlein's sci-fi classic ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,'' carried up by the former <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> executive Charles Simonyi during his two self-financed voyages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are there e-books in space? Astronauts do have iPods, according to Robert Pearlman, the editor of the space history Web site collectSPACE, but ''they are of the older, pre-touch-screen generation, and no Kindles, to my knowledge, have made their way to orbit as of yet.'' (Apparently, they have not yet been tested to make sure they don't release dangerous gases.) But astronauts do carry laptops, Pearlman added, and at least one book, ''Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight,'' whose co-editor is the astronaut and physician Michael Barratt, has been read -- and revised -- digitally in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING FOR MARS, II: Roach is known for her salty preoccupation with the body's lower functions, and ''Packing for Mars'' has a lot to say about the challenges of voiding in the void -- or, as she puts it, ''the continuing saga of zero-gravity elimination.'' The space shuttle training toilet at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, it turns out, is equipped with a potty cam. ''Imagine stumbling upon an especially rank porno channel,'' Roach writes, ''then realizing it's you on-screen.'' The bathroom reading is rather limited up there. ''Going to the bathroom in space is a much more 'engaging' activity than here on Earth,'' Pearlman told Roach. ''I suspect therefore not many books make it into the commode.'' Roach confirmed this impression in an e-mail. ''The bathroom reading on the shuttle, based on my time in the shuttle training toilet,'' she said, ''is the 29-step instruction card on the wall!'' As for the downside of too much toilet time, the risk of hemorrhoids may not be that much greater in space. ''Obviously in 1-g there's a pull on your bottom which exacerbates the problem for frequent hemorrhoid sufferers,'' Scott Weinstein, a crew habitability trainer at NASA, said via e-mail. ''But frankly, our astronauts don't have a lot of time for casual reading on the potty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">READING FOR EARTH: There are about a hundred books in space, according to a 2008 catalog of the International Space Station library posted at governmentattic.org, ranging from ''On the Origin of Species'' to ''The Ten-Day MBA.'' How many are there on Earth? <span class="companylink">Google</span> Books crunched the metadata and came up with a count of all the books ever published: 129,864,880 -- at least as of 8:26 a.m. on Aug 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 29, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A brief report in the Inside the List column last Sunday about Mary Roach's ''Packing for Mars,'' a book on the ways humans adapt to space travel, misstated the location of a toilet equipped with a closed-circuit camera used as a training aid for astronauts. It is at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, not on the space shuttle.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists working with NASA's Kepler satellite reported Thursday that they might have spotted a planet just 1.5 times the diameter of Earth around a Sun-like star 2,000 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still in the process of confirming this candidate is a planet,'' said Matthew Holman, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, at a NASA-sponsored news conference on Thursday. Dr. Holman is the lead author of an article describing the discoveries that the journal Science published on its Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the first announcement of a candidate Earth-size planet by the Kepler mission, which in March 2009 launched a one-ton spacecraft to search for planets like ours that just might harbor life. The planet was among more than 700 candidate planets that the team announced in June. If it is made of similar stuff as Earth, its mass would be three to four times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers are quickly closing in on Earth-size planets elsewhere in the galaxy as they find planetary systems that look more and more like our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This represents a significant step toward Kepler's goal of determining the frequency of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars,'' Dr. Holman said. Earth-size planets in orbits that are not too hot or too cold are considered the most likely places to look for life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler team also observed, more definitively, two giant, Saturn-size gas planets around the same star, known as Kepler-9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a European team reported what may be a smaller planet, with mass as little as 1.4 times that of Earth, around a star 127 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 15 years since the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star was discovered, astronomers have found close to 500 more. The first were huge gas planets -- composed mostly of hydrogen, similar to Jupiter -- that orbited extremely close to their stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as detection methods improved, astronomers began to find planets closer in size to Earth and planetary systems that contain nearly as many planets as our solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Earth-size planet seen by the European astronomers appears to be one of seven circling the star, HD 10180, located in the constellation Hydrus. Christophe Lovis of the University of Geneva, who led the observations, said the group was certain about the existence of five of the planets, all about the mass of Neptune, but squeezed into orbits closer to the star than Mars is to the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are less certain about the smallest planet. ''For this one, we have about 1 percent false alarm possibility,'' Dr. Lovis said. ''For us, 99 percent is just not enough to be completely sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team also tentatively detected a larger, Saturn-size planet farther from the star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither of the slightly-bigger-than-Earth planets is Earth-like or has much chance for anything to live there. Both have orbits very close to their stars that would sear the surfaces. The small Kepler-9 planet completes an orbit in just over a day and a half at a distance of 2.5 million miles from the star. The small HD 10180 planet is even closer and faster, less than two million miles from the star and completing an orbit in about 28 hours. Earth, by contrast, is 93 million miles from the Sun, and its orbit takes 365 days to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If one particular word can describe planetary systems today, it's 'diverse,' '' said Douglas N. C. Lin, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved with either team. ''Planets are common, and their properties are diverse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, most of the extrasolar planets have been found using the technique of the European team, by looking for wobbles in the wavelength of light from the star caused by the back-and-forth gravitational tugging of unseen planets. The discovery of the HD 10180 planets results from six years of observations at the European Southern Observatory's 3.6-meter telescope in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the orbits of planets are not edge-on to observers on Earth, the technique underestimates the masses of the planets. Dr. Lovis said that for HD 10180, computer simulations show that for the orbits to be stable, the planets cannot be more than three times the minimum masses calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some planets have been detected when a star dims momentarily as a planet passes in front. The duration of the dip tells the size of the planet, and the time between the light dips tells the length of the planet's orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler mission takes that notion and applies it on a grand scale by staring at a patch of sky in the Cygnus and Lyra constellations to continuously observe the brightness of 156,000 stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kepler scientist, Dimitar Sasselov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, created a stir last month when he said in a lecture that Kepler had discovered many Earth-like planets. He later said that the candidates had not been confirmed and that he should have said Earth-size, not Earth-like. The Kepler instruments cannot measure atmospheric or geological properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the astronomers have seven months of data, and Kepler is scheduled to operate for 3.5 years. Astronomers will soon be able to identify smaller planets farther out, including truly Earth-size planets in orbits that would impart Earth-like temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Come back in a couple of years,'' said William J. Borucki, Kepler's principal investigator, ''and we'll give you an answer.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VOYAGER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking Newer Worlds in the Third Great Age of Discovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Stephen J. Pyne</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 444 pp. Viking. $29.95</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in my career as a science journalist I lucked into what is still one of the most romantic experiences of my professional life. I got to cover the Voyager missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the closest I will ever come to ''Star Trek.'' The two Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, conducted a grand tour of the outer solar system that lasted more than a decade. They cruised over the skies of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and checked out weird landscapes carved in methane and black ice on their many moons, mapping hard features like craters, mountains, cracks, rilles, geysers of sodium and water, and the soft geography, as Stephen J. Pyne memorably calls it, of magnetic fields and radiation belts. They are still traveling. Now roughly 10 billion miles from the Sun, Voyagers 1 and 2 are heading for the boundary of the solar system and interstellar space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over those years we journalists periodically assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where images coming down from Voyager were displayed on television monitors in the pressroom at the same time that scientists huddled in the next building were receiving them. It was like being on the nose of a spaceship. Every morning at 11 o'clock selected members of the Voyager team would assemble in Von Karman Auditorium, nervous and self-conscious, unused to doing science in public, to try to explain what everyone was seeing. Or more often to say that they had no idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were all playing roles with a long tradition, as Pyne, a historian and professor of life sciences at Arizona State University, points out in ''Voyager,'' a meditation on the nature and meaning of exploration itself, disguised as a chronicle of the life and times of a space mission. There are ''moments of exploring that more than any other capture the general imagination, that fuse place, time, discovery and yearning in ways that seem to speak to an era's sense of itself. If they do not inform an age, they do display the vital attributes of an age as nothing else can,'' he writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voyager, he says, is ours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been waiting a long time for a gossipy, intensely reported account of what actually went on in the building next door among the Voyager scientists on their proxy trip to eternity. I wish this were it, but, alas, it's not. Pyne's book, which is based largely on previously published accounts, has deeper concerns. It's a rich mix of history, science and fine writing. Sometimes it seems as if Captain Cook and Prince Henry the Navigator themselves are aboard the busy spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This book blooms with such glorious rushes of exalted prose that I was dog-earing almost every page until I gave up. Contrasting the mission with human explorations from earlier eras, for example, Pyne writes that Voyager was ''a modernist machine loosed onto the cosmos. The Voyagers would not be blinded by gold or the mirage of fame. They would not abandon wife or child, or enslave unwary indigenes. They could not despair, could not be crippled by loneliness, could not fight for the cross or suffer for science, would not know epiphanies or endure tropical fevers. They would lay no claims, issue no proclamations of sovereignty, raise no toasts to king or republic, sign no treaties of trade or military alliance, nor send out reconnaissance parties to lay out routes for folk migration. . . . The Voyagers confronted no Other, or even life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Pyne tells it, there have been three times in Western history when the political, military, economic and, yes, scientific stars aligned to produce an age of exploration. The first wave was during the Renaissance. Think of Christopher Columbus or Magellan. The second great wave, commencing with expeditions to measure the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, had scientific aspirations. Think of Darwin and the Beagle; Lewis and Clark; or Alexander von Humboldt, the German naturalist who traipsed through South America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third wave had its roots in the exploration of Antarctica; the International Geophysical Year (1957-58), which also saw the surprise launching of Sputnik; and the cold war. Voyager owed its existence as well to luck -- a once-every-176-year alignment of the outer planets that made it feasible for a single spacecraft to visit them all on one long excursion through the icy darkness, using the gravity of one planet to slingshot itself to the next, a technique conceived in 1961 by a U.C.L.A. graduate student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pyne details the political maneuvering once a grand tour was endorsed by President Richard Nixon. It was canceled when NASA's budget began to crash in the post-Apollo letdown, then resurrected as a pair of spacecraft. Voyager 2 was launched first, on Aug. 20, 1977. Voyager 1, which would beat its sister to Jupiter and Saturn, followed on Sept. 5. ''Because of politics, the expedition almost didn't happen, and because of politics, it finally did,'' Pyne writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Voyagers spent most of the journey simply cruising through the void, with brief intervals of crazy action and discovery. Pyne handles those encounters with aplomb, highlighting the most memorable moments, but he spends most of the book cruising and ruminating on past explorations and drawing connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparisons to earlier voyages are fun and enlightening. The Portuguese navigators of the 15th century, for example, found that if they wanted to reach southern Africa, they shouldn't just sail down the coast but should go west in an arc, or gran volta, almost to Brazil and then catch the trade winds coming back east. Voyager had its own gran volta, looping past Jupiter in order to get up enough steam to make it to Saturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other ways, the Voyager missions were utterly unlike their predecessors. For one thing, there were no people on board, so nobody was coming back. Thus there was no way to embody the last stage of the journey of the mythological hero as sketched by Joseph Campbell, the figure who must return with the fruits of his adventure to help humankind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, there was no one to encounter, a subject on which Pyne waxes eloquent. The whole point of exploring, he says, is to meet somebody and be changed, but ''there was no one to enlist as a guide or impress as an interpreter. There was no one to reflect back a self-image of the explorer or serve as a prism to refract visions of the future. There was no one to stand, simply as himself, for an alternative moral universe. There was no one at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Voyager's most telling moments, he writes, were when it turned and looked backward, at the Earth and Moon, at Saturn's rings backlighted by the Sun, or at last the whole solar system with Earth as the famous pale blue dot. As of this writing, the Voyagers have each traveled more than 15 billion winding miles to the very edge of the solar system -- and us with them, only to find ourselves metaphorically back home, and, as T. S. Eliot wrote, to know the place for the first time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR the past two decades, NASA has been studying what happens to people when they are enclosed in small spaces for long periods of time. The research has yielded insights that might be of use to the 33 Chilean miners, who are likely to be trapped underground for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay connected: Researchers studying confinement on long Antarctic missions came to believe in a ''third quarter phenomenon,'' the emergence of depression and anxiety after a mission's halfway point. In two NASA studies involving 13 American and 17 Russian astronauts working on the Mir station and the International Space Station, my colleagues and I found that this response did not typically present itself with space travelers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Simple outside communication. When astronauts seemed to be feeling the blues, Russian space psychologists encouraged them to speak with family, friends and famous people on Earth. They asked them to play music and brighten the lights on board, and they sent unexpected presents and favorite foods on resupply ships. American mission control psychologists have employed similar tactics. For this reason, anything that enhances the link between the miners and family and friends should be encouraged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outsiders: In our orbital studies, we found that crew members displaced intragroup tension and negative feelings to the ''out-group,'' in the astronauts' case, mission control personnel. We all have experienced displacement. You are angry at a boss but can't say anything for fear of reprisal. Instead, you go home and unload on your partner or scream at the parakeet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The miners will probably form subgroups involving people with similar interests and values from whom they can receive solace when they feel angry at someone else. But what if everyone starts to feel frustrated? Will they displace their feelings to the surface, believing that those above aren't trying hard enough to be of help?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important for topsiders to be aware of this possibility. The miners should be made to perceive themselves and people on the surface as a team working together. Also, taking a cue from mission control, where the person who communicates directly with the astronauts is usually also an astronaut, it would be useful to have a trusted miner on the surface speaking with the miners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Support the leader: Luis Urzua, a 54-year-old shift foreman, has emerged as the de facto leader of the miners. Decades-long research in the Antarctic found that successful leaders in these situations perform twin (sometimes conflicting) roles: they assign tasks and monitor the emotional states of individuals. Our space research supports these observations. Those above ground should therefore do everything in their power to reinforce Mr. Urzua in these two roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family time: In our work we found that astronauts sometimes worry more about their families on Earth than about themselves in space. While the Chilean government is focusing its attention on the miners, it is crucial that it care for their families, too; knowing that someone is attending to their loved ones will be a relief to the miners, helping them endure the stifling days of confinement ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hundred fifty-four feet long, packed with 700 tons of propellant and anchored to the side of a Utah hill, a solid rocket motor developed for NASA's next generation of rockets is to unleash 3.6 million pounds of thrust in a test Tuesday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether this motor design will ever go anywhere is uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To critics, the solid rocket motor -- an elongated version of the boosters that fly on the space shuttles -- is expensive, antiquated technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates counter that solids are reliable and safe and provide a big bang for the buck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is still working on Constellation, the program to send people back to the Moon, and those plans call for the solid rocket motor to serve as the first stage of the Ares I rocket for taking astronauts to the International Space Station and part of the Ares V rocket for the Moon missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Obama administration wants to cancel Constellation, and bills moving through Congress also scale back the human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus NASA will be revisiting the question of what rocket to build next and whether solids will be part of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're starting from scratch, maybe, maybe not,'' said Douglas O. Stanley of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who led a 2005 NASA study that came up with the Constellation architecture. ''If you're starting from where we are now, you don't have to develop the solids. They're already developed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over solids is illustrative of the many questions swirling around the space program's future. Should NASA build on tried-and-true technologies or start over on new designs? Should it aim to build the safest possible rocket, at great cost, or is a rocket that is cheaper and still considerably safer than the space shuttles safe enough?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid rockets go back to the first rockets, essentially gunpowder in tubes, invented by the Chinese perhaps a millennium ago. NASA's solid rocket motors, built by <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>., or ATK, in Utah, employ the same basic concept: burning the fuel expels hot gases that generate thrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The propellant is a mix of aluminum, ammonium perchlorate, a polymer called polybutadiene acrylonitrile, epoxy and iron oxide poured into cylindrical steel casings 12 feet wide, almost like cake batter into pans. It hardens into the consistency of a pencil eraser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The casings are later stacked at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle booster consists of four segments. NASA has spent a little more than $1 billion developing the longer Ares version, which adds a fifth segment for greater thrust. In the first ground test last September, the engine performed as expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's test measures performance at cooler temperatures. Enclosed in a rollaway building, the motor has been chilled to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stanley said the appeal of solid rocket motors is a high thrust-to-weight ratio, which can provide a big, quick push off the launching pad. Solid rocket motors are also much simpler in design, with fewer parts to break than liquid fuel rocket engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Solids tend to buy their way on,'' Dr. Stanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics note that the one failure of a shuttle solid rocket booster was catastrophic: it killed the seven astronauts aboard the shuttle Challenger in January 1986. Defenders point out that the booster itself did not explode; rather, hot gases escaping from a segment joint ignited the liquid fuel in the external tank. A redesign of the joint eliminated the problem, and over all, the solid rocket motors have encountered far fewer technical problems than the shuttle's liquid main engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle solids, Dr. Stanley said, ''have a very high demonstrated reliability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-segment motors would also take advantage of the existing factory that builds the shuttle boosters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For James Muncy, a space policy consultant who has been an ardent critic of Constellation, that is exactly the reason he would like the solids to go away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They work,'' he said. But he added: ''They're expensive. Nobody else needs them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttles never lived up to their initial promises for affordable, frequent access to orbit. The shuttles are complex machines requiring large teams of people to manufacture and assemble the pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Muncy and others conclude that eliminating the shuttle infrastructure is necessary for shaping a leaner, more affordable space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That appeared to be the thinking of the Obama administration and top NASA officials in February when they first called for the cancellation of Constellation and their desire to finance the development of commercial rockets for taking astronauts to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a news conference announcing the administration's proposed 2011 budget for the space agency, Lori Garver, the deputy administrator, said the agency did not plan to buy more solid rocket motors, although ATK could use the motor for its own rocket if it wished to bid for the commercial crew business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With regard to heavy-lift technologies, we're looking at new engine technology programs,'' Ms. Garver said. ''So there is not a funding line certainly not beyond 2010 that we have for solid rocket motors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Congress has resisted the administration plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month the Senate passed an authorization bill for NASA that called for the immediate development of a heavy-lift rocket, which might take advantage of shuttle technologies including the solid rocket motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An equivalent bill under consideration in the House takes a pessimistic view on commercial companies' being able to transport people to space and calls for continued development of a NASA rocket -- presumably Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK has said that the yearly costs for maintaining its factories and producing two motors a year could drop to as little as $300 million a year if it is given enough leeway to run its operations efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Muncy said that as NASA is the only customer of segmented solids, ATK would never produce enough of them to drive down costs further, and NASA alone would continue to pay for ATK's infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He instead favors NASA shifting to using <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed rockets currently used for launching military satellites. That way, he said, the infrastructure costs would be shared by the Defense Department ''and you're not having to pay the fixed costs of something no one else is using and no one else is paying for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Muncy said of Tuesday's test: ''I wish them the best of luck. I don't know why they're doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 1, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a new solid rocket motor developed for NASA misspelled part of the name of a chemical component in the propellant that the motor uses. It is ammonium perchlorate, not ammonia perchlorate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourteen Nobel laureates have signed a letter supporting President Obama's proposed strategy for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and criticizing a NASA authorization bill under consideration in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House bill, the writers said, would leave ''substantially underfunded'' the areas of technology development, commercial spaceflight, robotic missions, and university and student research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are the key elements of the president's new plan for NASA that must be retained in any consensus solution reached by Congress and the White House,'' said the letter, delivered to the office of Representative Bart Gordon, a Tennessee Democrat who leads the Committee on Science and Technology. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signers included David Baltimore of the California Institute of Technology, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1975; Baruch S. Blumberg, a former director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute and a winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1976; Douglas D. Osheroff of Stanford, a member of the board that investigated the loss of the space shuttle Columbia and a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1996; and Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004. Some former NASA officials and seven former astronauts also signed the letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G. Scott Hubbard, who was director of NASA's Ames Research Center, said he and John M. Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute of George Washington University, came up with the idea for the letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his budget request for the 2011 fiscal year, Mr. Obama proposed canceling the Constellation program for returning astronauts to the moon, financing commercial companies for taking astronauts to the International Space Station and developing new space technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Senate version of the authorization bill, passed last month, reduced money for commercial crew and technology development to finance the development of a heavy-lift rocket. The House bill would take away almost all the money from the commercial crew program and instead offer loan guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group, helped coordinate the effort.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the triumph of NASA's 1976 Viking mission, which put two unmanned spacecraft on Mars, there was one major disappointment: The landers failed to find carbon-based molecules that could serve as the building blocks of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complete lack of these organic molecules was a surprise, and the notion of a desolate, lifeless Mars persisted for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some scientists say that conclusion was premature and perhaps even incorrect. They suggest that such building blocks -- known as organic molecules, although they need not come from living organisms -- were indeed in the soil, but that they were inadvertently destroyed before they could be detected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If true, that could cast the scientific conclusions of the Viking mission in a new light, especially since another Viking experiment claimed to have found living microbes in the soil. Most scientists discounted that possibility -- how could there be life in soil devoid of the building blocks of life?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That gospel of the Viking results has influenced our perspective on life of Mars for 35 years,'' said Christopher McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California and an author of the new findings, to be published in The Journal of Geophysical Research -- Planets. ''What do they find? Nothing. But it turns out it was not really nothing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers scooped Martian soil samples and heated them, looking for organic compounds in the released gases. It found only two -- chloromethane and dichloromethane -- and the scientists concluded that the chlorine compounds were contaminants from fluids used to clean the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in 2008, NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander unexpectedly found a chlorine chemical, perchlorate, in the planet's arctic soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new experiments, the scientists heated a mixture of perchlorate with soil from the Atacama Desert in Chile, often considered the closest thing on Earth to Mars. Chemical reactions destroyed organic compounds in the soil, producing mostly carbon dioxide and traces of chloromethane and dichloromethane, just like what the Viking landers had found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now when we look back at the Viking results, it makes sense,'' Dr. McKay said. ''It was bizarre chemistry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the veteran Mars researcher Gilbert V. Levin, the new paper offers a measure of vindication. His Viking experiment added nutrients to the soil and measured releases of radioactive gas, which would occur as microbes ate the food. Radioactive gas was released, but with the lack of organics in the soil, most concluded it had come from a nonbiological chemical reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael Navarro-Gonzalez of the National Autonomous University of Mexico City and lead author of the new study, said the claim that Viking found life was still inconclusive. ''It gives a big possibility,'' he said, ''but of course we don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Levin acknowledged that nonbiological reactions could cause gas to be released, but said the Viking experiment showed that whatever was producing the gas did so at temperatures plausible for microbes but not for other explanations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the leader of the Viking organics experiment, Klaus Biemann, a retired professor at M.I.T., doubts the new interpretation. He noted that the experiment also detected freon, which was certainly a contaminant, and that the presence of perchlorate at the Viking sites, far from where the Phoenix landed, was speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More definitive answers could come with the Mars Science Laboratory, scheduled to be launched next year and to arrive in 2012. It will carry an experiment that will be able to separate perchlorates from organic molecules and thus allow it to identify the organics without destroying them.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>1270 words</div><div>16 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> said Wednesday that it was entering the space tourism business, an announcement that could bolster the Obama administration's efforts to transform the National Aeronautics and Space Administration into an agency that focuses less on building rockets and more on nurturing a commercial space industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flights, which could begin as early as 2015, would most likely launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida to the International Space Station. The Obama administration has proposed turning over to private companies the business of taking NASA astronauts to orbit, and <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> of Las Vegas won an $18 million contract this year for preliminary development and testing of a capsule that could carry seven passengers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current NASA plans call for four space station crew members to go up at a time, which would leave up to three seats available for space tourists. The flights would be the first to give nonprofessional astronauts the chance to go into orbit aboard a spacecraft launched from the United States. Seven earlier space tourists have made visits to the space station, riding in Russian Soyuz capsules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're ready now to start talking to prospective customers,'' said Eric C. Anderson, co-founder and chairman of Space Adventures, the space tourism company based in Virginia that would market the seats for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Space Adventures have not set a price, although Mr. Anderson said it would be competitive with the Soyuz flights, which Space Adventures arranged with the Russian Space Agency. Guy Laliberte, founder of Cirque du Soleil, paid about $40 million for a Soyuz ride and an eight-day stay at the space station last year. But the prospects that anyone buying a ticket will get to space on an American vehicle hinge on discussions in Congress about the future of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the era of the space shuttle winds down -- two, perhaps three shuttle flights remain -- a clash of visions over what should come next has kept the space agency adrift for much of the past year. An authorization bill written by the House Science and Technology Committee to lay out the direction of NASA for the next three years would largely follow the traditional trajectory for human spaceflight. It calls on NASA to build a government-owned rocket -- likely the Ares I, which NASA has been working on for five years -- for taking astronauts to the space station and then a larger one for missions to the Moon, asteroids and eventually Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competing vision, embodied in President Obama's 2011 budget proposal for NASA, focuses instead on investing in companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> that want to develop the space equivalent of airlines. NASA would then just buy seats on those rockets to send its astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition, the thinking goes, would drive down the costs of getting to space, leading to a profitable new American industry and freeing more of NASA's budget for deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of the free enterprise approach are rallying to block the House version of the NASA authorization bill, which provides only $150 million a year over the next three years for the private-sector space travel initiative, which is known as commercial crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Werb, chairman of the Space Frontier Foundation, was blunt in his assessment of the House bill. ''I think it's awful,'' he said. ''It's leaving NASA with way more pork than program. I see that as a disaster for the agency.'' Mr. Werb's group is urging its supporters to register disapproval with their Congressional representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the president's budget proposed $6 billion over five years for the commercial crew program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Wednesday's news conference, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> officials said that the federal government would have to pay much of the development costs in order for the effort to succeed. ''This is an uncertain market,'' said John Elbon, program manager for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s commercial crew effort. ''If we had to do this with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> investment only and the risk factors were in there, we wouldn't be able to close the business case.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight constraint, of course, is money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a panel led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, concluded that the ambitious program started under President George W. Bush to establish a permanent moon base was ''not executable'' because of inadequate financing. In fact, the panel could not devise any program that could send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit and still fit within the $100 billion allocated to the human spaceflight program in the fiscal years of 2010 through 2020. It offered several alternatives that would require an extra $30 billion over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget request for 2011 sought a modest increase in NASA over all, to $19 billion, but kept the budget projections for the human spaceflight program almost unchanged from the levels that the Augustine panel found inadequate. The panel said that without an increase, the United States should scale back its space ambitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With that budget,'' Mr. Augustine said in an interview this summer, ''I still think there is no really meaningful space exploration program that involves humans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration worked around the budget shortfall by proposing the cancellation of the entire moon program, known as Constellation, including the Ares I rocket and the Orion crew capsule. Instead, NASA would essentially take a five-year hiatus from large-scale development initiatives and instead work on new technologies that could make the task of space exploration easier and cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House Science and Technology Committee, in its effort to squeeze NASA's human spaceflight program into the budget box, deleted almost all the money from commercial crew and large-scale technology demonstration projects and applied it to slimmed-down Constellation rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Senate passed its version of the NASA authorization bill, which is more of a compromise. It provides less for commercial crew in the first three years than the president's request, but the longer-term plan is to provide the same $6 billion, spread over six years instead of five. It cancels the Ares I rocket and instead directs NASA to begin development of a heavy-lift rocket and indicates that the design should be based on space shuttle technologies, a boon for those contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some experts like Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now heads the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the Senate bill might be repeating the mistake of asking NASA to do too much with too little money. The Senate bill provides less money for development of a larger heavy-lift rocket than the House does for completing the Ares I, already well under development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I respect the need for political compromise,'' Dr. Pace said of the Senate bill, but added, ''It takes some programmatic risk. It spreads itself out too much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff members of the House science committee have been meeting with their counterparts on the Senate's Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation seeking a middle ground. House leaders could move forward with the science committee's bill or substitute the Senate bill or a compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If no final NASA authorization emerges, the Senate and House appropriation committees would decide what to include in NASA's 2011 budget and could end up with something closer to the original Obama proposal.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general of NASA released a report on Monday saying that the head of the agency made a mistake when he contacted an oil company to which he has close ties, but that he did not violate federal laws or ethics regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., is a former board member of <span class="companylink">Marathon Oil</span> and remains a major stockholder. He called a senior Marathon executive in April seeking advice about an alternative-fuel project that NASA was considering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said General Bolden's 10-minute conversation with the executive was inconsistent with the ethics pledge he signed upon taking office last year. It also raised concerns about an appearance of a conflict of interest, the inspector general said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the call, General Bolden, a two-time space shuttle commander and retired Marine general, held stock in Marathon worth $500,000 to $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general acknowledged to the inspector general that he made a mistake when he talked to Marathon about the fuel project, calling his action ''inappropriate.'' He has since recused himself from the project and has taken refresher ethics training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The episode was the latest in a series of missteps by General Bolden. Over the summer, he said in an interview with the Middle Eastern news network Al-Jazeera that one of NASA's main tasks was to reach out to the Muslim world and help Muslims feel good about their historical contributions to science. NASA and the White House spent a good part of July trying to defend and explain his comments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign to bring a retired space shuttle to a pier in Manhattan appeared to be fizzling out until one of New York's senators slipped a phrase into a bill that Congress passed just before midnight on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning to give three space shuttles away after the program ends next year. The Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum on the West Side has been lobbying to land one of the orbiters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competition has been spirited: the other candidates include the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Museum of Flight in Seattle.Last month, the Intrepid appeared to be out of the running because an earlier version of the bill limited the contenders to sites that had a historical relationship with the shuttle program. Then, Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat, managed to amend the qualifications to include applicants that had been involved in "the retrieval of NASA manned space vehicles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bingo. (Or maybe, splashdown.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the 1960s when the Intrepid was an operating aircraft carrier, its crews plucked a few astronauts from the sea after they hit the ocean in space capsules. Congress will send the amended version of the bill to President Obama to sign and within a few months, the administration is expected to announce whether a shuttle will land in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This legislation will ensure a level playing field for New York, and on a level playing field New York will win," Sen. Gillibrand said on Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might be a place that only a lichen or pond scum could love, but astronomers said Wednesday that they had found a very distant planet capable of harboring water on its surface, thus potentially making it a home for plant or animal life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody from Earth will be visiting anytime soon: The planet, which goes by the bumpy name of Gliese 581g, is orbiting a star about 20 light-years away in the constellation Libra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the finding is confirmed by other astronomers, the planet, which has three to four times the mass of Earth, would be the most Earthlike planet yet discovered, and the first to meet the criteria for being potentially habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a long haul,'' said Steven S. Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who, along with R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, led the team that made the discovery. ''This is the first exoplanet that has the right conditions for water to exist on its surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent report for the National Academy of Science, astronomers declared the finding of such planets one of the major goals of this decade. NASA's Kepler satellite -- which was launched in March 2009 as a way to detect Earthlike bodies -- is expected to harvest dozens or hundreds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gliese 581g (whose first name is pronounced GLEE-za) circles a dim red star known as Gliese 581, once every 37 days, at a distance of about 14 million miles. That is smack in the middle of the so-called Goldilocks zone, where the heat from the star is neither too cold nor too hot for water to exist in liquid form on its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really the first Goldilocks planet,'' Dr. Butler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other astronomers hailed the news as another harbinger that the search for ''living planets,'' as Dimitar D. Sasselov of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics calls them, is on the right track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm getting goose bumps,'' said Caleb Scharf of Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they expressed caution about this particular planet, noting uncertainties about its density, composition and atmosphere, and the need for another generation of giant telescopes and spacecraft in order to find out anything more about it. Other Goldilocks planets have come and gone in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery was announced at a news conference Wednesday in Washington, and the findings have been posted on the National Science Foundation's Web site and will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors said the relative ease by which planet was found -- in only 11 years -- led them to believe that such planets must be common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Either we have just been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery,'' they wrote in their paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressed during the news conference about the possibility of life on Gliese 581g, Dr. Vogt protested that he was an astronomer, not a biologist. Then he relented, saying that, speaking strictly personally, he believed that ''the chances of life on this planet are almost 100 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked the same question, Dr. Butler squirmed and said, ''I like data.'' After a pause he added: ''And what the data say is that the planet is the right distance from the star to have water and the right mass to hold an atmosphere. What is needed simply to find lots and lots of these things is lots and lots of telescope time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest results from Gliese 581 were harvested from observations by two often competing teams, using telescopes in Chile and Hawaii to measure the slight gravitational tugs the star gets as its planets swing by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is hardly the first time around the block for Gliese 581, which is a longtime favorite of planet hunters and now is known to have six planets in its retinue. It is a dwarf star about one-third the mass of the Sun and only about one-hundredth as bright, allowing planets to huddle closer to the campfire. ''It hauntingly reminds us of our own solar system,'' Dr. Butler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of Gliese's planets have already had their moment in the limelight as possible Goldilocks planets. One, known as Gliese 581c, circles just on the inner edge of the habitable zone and was thus thought to be habitable three years ago. But further analysis suggested that the greenhouse effect would turn it into a stifling hell. Another planet, just on the outer edge of the Goldilocks zone, is probably too cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One is on the hot side, the other is on cold side,'' and the new planet is right in between, Dr. Vogt said. ''It's bookended.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues estimated the average temperature on the surface of Gliese 581g to be between 10 and minus 24 degrees Fahrenheit, about the same as a summer day in Antarctica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that means very little, he said, because the planet, like all the others in that system, keeps the same face to the star all the time. So the temperature could vary wildly from the day-side to the night-side of the planet, meaning that an organism could perhaps find a comfortable zone to live in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nobody really knows what is going on on Gliese 581g, said Sara Seager, a planetary astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''If it was all carbon dioxide, like Venus, it would be pretty hot,'' she said, adding that she would give the planet a 90 percent chance of holding water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, she pointed out, is faint praise in scientific circles. ''Sounds high, but would you fly on a plane that only had an 8 or 9 chance out of 10 of making it?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone is so primed to say here's the next place we're going to find life,'' Dr. Seager said, ''but this isn't a good planet for follow-up.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan 18, 11:11 p.m. | Updated [Illustrating that science on the edge of understanding is implicitly tentative, the case against Gliese 581g appears to be gaining strength.]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk about timing. Months ago, Rory Barnes, an astronomer at the University of Washington with a talent for finding planets, agreed to give a plenary talk at the northwest sectional meeting of the American Physical Society on the subject of "The Hunt for Habitable Exoplanets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The talk takes place today in Walla Walla, Wash., but Barnes, in an e-mail exchange last night, said he "had to rush through some quick changes," adding that "I'm not complaining."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason, of course, was the news this week that other planet hunters had identified a planet, Gliese 581g, with attributes suitable for harboring life (as we know it) orbiting a red dwarf star about 20 light years from Earth. I asked Barnes for his impressions of the planet and he said it looks like "the real deal." Among the critical characteristics, of course, is greenhouse warming (yet another reminder that there really is such a phenomenon).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe Steve Forbert will have to think about updating the title (as suggested in parentheses) of his great tune "Good Planets Are (Not So) Hard to Find."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here we are, sitting on a "real deal" planet, regarding evidence hinting -- as has long been presumed -- that there are quite a few other potential havens for biology out there. But simple logic, whether or not you subscribe to the precautionary principle, says we would do well to take extra care in making sure we don't screw up this one in ways that are hard to reverse. As Carl Sagan noted in his "pale blue dot" speech in 1996, "there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's Barnes's abstract as it read before the news broke:Fifteen years after the discovery of planets around other stars, the discovery of rocky, 1 Earth-mass, 1 Earth-radius planets around other stars is imminent. Of particular interest are planets that receive similar amounts of stellar radiation as the Earth, as they could support liquid water, probably the most critical requirement for habitability. Current technology favors the discovery of these planets around low-mass stars, about one-tenth the mass of the sun. In that case, habitable planets need to orbit about ten times closer to these cooler star. Such proximity introduces hazards that are of negligible importance for life on Earth: increased exposure to (time-varying) short wavelength radiation, stronger magnetic fields, tidal effects, and atmospheric removal by the stellar wind. Nevertheless, there are no obvious reasons to presume these planets are sterile. I discuss observational campaigns to discover rocky exoplanets, theoretical methods to predict their potential habitability, and prospects for the remote detection of life.He said he'll send a note describing the buzz about Gliese 581 from the meeting. In the meantime, here's his detailed reaction to the findings: My first impression of this discovery is that it is the real deal. There have been other planets that have flirted with potential habitability, but this one is a very good candidate. I see five issues for habitability: 1) greenhouse warming, 2) composition (water?), 3) internal energy, 4) stellar flaring, and 5) tidal effects. None of these appear to be obvious impediments to habitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1) Although it receives slightly less radiation from its host star than the Earth, that is not really an issue. The Earth needs about 20 degrees of greenhouse warming to reach the freezing point of water, whereas this planet requires about 50. A little more water, CO2 or methane than in the Earth's atmosphere would take care of that, and that is entirely plausible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2) Does it have the right ingredients for life, specifically water? I suspect yes. That there are 6 planets within 1 AU of the host star suggest the planets migrated from colder environs of the protoplanetary nebulae. Models of terrestrial planet formation of low-mass stars find that if planets form only from local material, they don't get much bigger than 1 Earth mass. But this system has tens of Earth masses close to its star. Therefore the most likely origin scenario for these planets is that they formed at larger distances where ice was very prevalent, so probably this planet accreted a substantial amount of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3) Habitable planets require communication between the surface and the interior. This can only occur if there is sufficient internal energy to drive resurfacing on the planet (like plate tectonics on the Earth). Otherwise nasty molecules like carbon dioxide can build up in the atmosphere. On the Earth, the internal energy comes from radioactive decay and the ongoing differentiation of the Earth. Larger planets will probably have more energy from these sources, but the radiogeneic inventory of the planet is a wild card (it's hard to know the isotopic ratios of exoplanets). Being close to its star, the planet also probably receives some tidal heating, similar to on Io. The level of tidal heating is difficult to estimate without better information about its orbit (specifically its eccentricity), but my preliminary calculations lead me to believe it's about 1-10% of the Earth current level of internal heating. Not much, but it can help. And it's certainly not at Io's level. So all in all, there's probably enough energy for tectonic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4) One of the concerns raised for planets around low-mass stars is that the habitable zone is closer to these more active stars. In other words, atmospheres could be removed by larger stellar winds and coronal mass ejections. Vogt et al. point out that this particular star is actually very quiescent. So at least at present that doesn't seem to be an issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5) Tidal effects are also of concern for planets in the habitable zones of lows mass stars. In additional to the heating described above, tides can also lock the rotation rate and fix the orientation of the rotation. There seems to be a lot of concern regarding the possibility of synchronous rotation (often mistakenly assumed to be the same as "tidally locked"). I study tides, so I could go on about this for hours, but here are the salient points. Planets can get caught in spin-orbit resonances, such as Mercury, and rotate faster than synchronous. Or if the orbit is modestly eccentric, the planet will probably rotate faster than synchronous. We can't tell if these phenomena have occurred, but they are certainly possible. If the tilt goes to zero, that could also be bad, but the tilt could be forced by interactions with the other planets (this occurs on Mars). If the tilt is non-zero and the planet rotates synchronously, then at least certain regions of the planet will oscillate through day and night. And even if it is synchronously rotating, certain regions of the planet can still be habitable.For more on the newfound planet, review the video discussion below, posted by the National Science Foundation:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, best known as the agency that put the first man on the moon, is about to end its moon program for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under legislation passed by the House late Wednesday, the nation's spaceflight program will take a new direction. NASA -- the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- will turn to private companies to launch astronauts into space, while it starts work on a larger rocket for travel to more distant destinations -- an asteroid, perhaps, and eventually Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill ''helps put the U.S. space program on a more sustainable trajectory,'' Lori B. Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said Thursday during a telephone news conference. ''We now have an important framework.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House, in a 304-to-118 vote on Wednesday, approved a Senate-written bill authorizing $58 billion for NASA over the next three years and setting priorities for the agency. The Senate passed the bill in August, and it now goes to President Obama for his signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As requested by the administration in February, it cancels Constellation, the ambitious program that was to have sent astronauts back to the moon to establish an outpost, but which no longer fits in the budget. NASA has spent more than $10 billion on Constellation in the past five years, mostly on the Ares I rocket and Orion crew capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the compromise legislation does not cancel all of Constellation, as Mr. Obama had originally sought. Development of Orion, capable of deep space missions, is to continue, and the bill directs NASA to develop a heavy-lift rocket able to propel a payload of at least 70 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next skirmish is likely to be over the design of that rocket. The new bill clearly envisions a rocket built of components used in the space shuttles and Constellation's soon-to-be-canceled Ares I rocket. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which wrote the bill, said in an accompanying report that it expected the rocket to include solid-fuel boosters like those of the shuttle or Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some NASA and administration officials have considered switching to the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets currently used to launch satellites for the Air Force. They believe those could be more efficient and less costly because they would avoid infrastructure used only for NASA launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garver said that NASA would study all options, including the Delta IV and Atlas V. The legislation calls for NASA to report to Congress in 90 days with a plan for the heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mandate also extends the space shuttle era. Instead of retiring the shuttles in February, it provides money for one more flight to take supplies to the International Space Station in the second half of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pay for the additional shuttle flight and the heavy-lift rocket, the authorization cut deeply into money for future space technologies that NASA had hoped to develop, like orbiting fuel stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the lopsided vote in favor of the bill, support for it was not unequivocal. Opponents called it a bad bill; supporters called it flawed, but better than no bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like Candide, it's the best of all possible worlds,'' said John Logsdon, a space policy expert at George Washington University. ''It answers the political imperatives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the transitions have already begun. <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>., the company that builds the solid-fuel boosters for the space shuttles and Ares I, announced 426 layoffs on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the layoffs had been expected as the shuttle program have wound down, but the cuts are also a result of the end of Ares I and Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after Mr. Obama signs the bill into law, NASA cannot yet begin working in earnest on its new mission. Congress has not finished any of the appropriation bills, which set the actual spending levels, for the 2011 fiscal year, which starts Friday. And the stopgap continuing resolution keeps NASA's spending levels -- and programs, including Constellation -- unchanged until after the election in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A planet orbiting a star causes a slight disturbance in the star's rotation, the effect of the gravitational tug between the star and the planet. Astronomers have been studying the wobbling of stars for a couple of decades, in hopes of finding an exoplanet -- a planet beyond our solar system -- that might offer the possibility of sustaining human life. Now, after 11 years of searching with specialized instruments in Chile and Hawaii, a team of American astronomers has announced in the Astrophysical Journal that it has found the first likely candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet is called Gliese 581g after its sun, Gliese 581, a red dwarf vastly dimmer than our sun and about 20 light-years from Earth. Potentially habitable does not mean Earthlike. It means that Gliese 581g is the right distance from its sun to be in the habitable zone, able to sustain liquid water and with enough gravity to retain an atmosphere. Gliese 581g orbits its sun in a bit more than 36 days and is almost certainly tidally locked, meaning the same side of the planet always faces the sun. That probably means wide extremes in temperature and a permanent twilight zone between night and day where the climates are more moderate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this discovery so important is that it happened so early in the search for exoplanets and after examining only a tiny sample of small candidate stars as close to Earth as Gliese 581. In the paper reporting their discovery, the astronomers discuss the probable implications with carefully calibrated language that still doesn't hide their excitement. ''If the local stellar neighborhood,'' they write, ''is a representative sample of the galaxy as a whole, our Milky Way could be teeming with potentially habitable planets.'' We are intrigued, too.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's call for sweeping changes in the space program got mugged by lobbyists and pork-minded legislators. An authorization bill for NASA -- the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- that cleared Congress will leave the agency mired in past technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama shocked Congress and the space industry when he announced plans to abandon the Bush administration's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2020 and terminate development of the rockets and crew capsules needed to get there. Instead, he proposed to rely on commercial companies to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station orbit and called on NASA to develop ''game-changing'' technologies to make travel to more distant destinations -- asteroids and eventually Mars -- cheaper and faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That made good sense to us as a way to focus NASA on truly venturesome projects while leaving more mundane chores to private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill, which the president is expected to sign and NASA claims to be grateful for, cancels most of the expensive Constellation program that was developing rockets and capsules to establish a base on the Moon. But it orders NASA to develop and fly a new heavy-lift rocket by the end of 2016. The only way to make that deadline (and follow detailed instructions in a Senate report) is by using technologies from existing programs, hardly ''game-changing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is money for research on future space technologies but far less than the president sought. The bill also authorizes an extra shuttle flight beyond those already planned but fails to say where the $500 million to pay for the flight will come from, increasing the risk other NASA programs will be cannibalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A primary goal of those who drafted the legislation was to provide money and save jobs at existing NASA centers and their contractors. At a time of high unemployment, it's hard to argue with that impulse. But the result will be to postpone -- possibly for decades -- the development of the new technologies that could revolutionize long-distance space travel.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNITED NATIONS -- There is no United Nations special envoy for space aliens, let's get that straight from the outset, nor even an official designated to pick up the phone should one call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true, however, that a United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs sits in Vienna. (No, it has nothing to do with amorous astronauts, either.) Its task consists basically of monitoring or refereeing cosmic matters -- space debris, for example, or maintaining a list of about 3,000 objects sent hurtling into orbit in the past roughly 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until this week, one could argue that with the exception of the scientific community, the office was more obscure than outer space itself. But it has been thrust into the limelight by a scientific conference in Britain whose panels included space-related topics like ''Calling ET, or Not Even Answering the Phone?'' and ''Extraterrestrial Life and Arising Political Issues for the U.N. Agenda.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, basically, is that one day, maybe one day soon, some manner of life or maybe a signal will materialize from another galaxy far, far away. How should earthlings react? Might, for example, the United Nations be designated the spokesman for the entire planet if Darth Vader comes to call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference organizers totally dismissed that latter possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not the little green man in the flying saucer -- that is the wrong image,'' said an organizer, Martin Dominik, a physicist at the University of St. Andrews. What is meant, he explained, were microbes, or perhaps an electronic signal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There could be interaction between life on our planet and life elsewhere so how do we deal with that,'' Mr. Dominik said, warming to the topic. What if the microbes are harmful, for example, or the signal hostile?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The question is should we send messages into outer space or not?'' Mr. Dominik added. ''Is this dangerous? Should we make ourselves visible to extraterrestrial life or not? If they know we are here, do they want to destroy us, will they help us, do we gain something from that? These are all open questions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue becomes more pressing as knowledge of other planetary systems expands and radio telescopes can beam ever more powerful signals into the void. The United Nations could play a valuable role, Mr. Dominik and others noted, in preventing a single nation, or perhaps, the American military from hogging the dance card of the first alien, even if it is a microbe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the United Nations will take a position, exactly. The secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, refused to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no United Nations position on extraterrestrial life,'' said Mazlan Othman, the Malaysian astrophysicist who runs the Office for Outer Space Affairs. (''I am not the ambassador to aliens!'' she said.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a certain recognition that since the 192 United Nations members are generally incapable of reaching agreement on pressing earthly matters like climate change, negotiating a protocol for alien encounters will be one long slog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discussion on coping with a threatening asteroid collision has already been grinding on in a subcommittee since 1999, Ms. Othman noted. ''To get consensus on anything at all is difficult at the United Nations -- water, peacekeeping, it is not just extraterrestrials,'' she said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>829 words</div><div>22 October 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>20</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon, at least at the bottom of a deep, dark cold crater near its south pole, seems to be wetter than the Sahara, scientists reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In lunar terms, that is an oasis, surprisingly wet for a place that had long been thought by many planetary scientists to be utterly dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronauts were to visit this crater, they might be able to use eight wheelbarrows of soil to melt 10 to 13 gallons of water. The water, if purified, could be used for drinking, or broken apart into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel -- to get home or travel to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is a very valuable resource,'' said Anthony Colaprete, principal investigator of NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite -- or Lcross, for short -- which made the observations as it, by design, slammed into the Moon a year ago. ''This is wetter than some places on Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sahara sands are 2 to 5 percent water, and the water is tightly bound to the minerals. In the lunar crater, which lies in perpetual darkness, the water is in the form of almost pure ice grains mixed in with the rest of the soil, and is easy to extract. The ice is about 5.6 percent of the mixture, and possibly as high as 8.5 percent of it, Dr. Colaprete said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is a large number, larger than I think anyone was anticipating,'' Dr. Colaprete said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $79 million Lcross mission piggybacked on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which was launched in June last year and has been mapping out the lunar surface for a future return by astronauts. Lcross steered the empty second stage of the rocket, which otherwise would have just burned up in the Earth's atmosphere, onto a collision course with the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, as it neared impact, the Lcross spacecraft released the empty second stage and slowed down slightly so that it could watch the stage's 5,600-mile-per-hour crash into a 60-mile-wide, 2-mile-deep crater named Cabeus. A few minutes later, Lcross, quickly transmitting its gathered data to Earth, met a similar demise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people who watched the live Webcast video transmitted by Lcross, the event was a disappointment, with no visible plume from the impacts. But as they analyzed the data, scientists found everything they were looking for, and more. Last November, the team reported that the impact had kicked up at least 26 gallons of water, confirming suspicions of ice in the craters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new results increase the water estimate to about 40 gallons, and by estimating by amount of dirt excavated by the impact, calculated the concentration of water for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of articles reporting the Lcross results appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also surprising was the cornucopia of other elements and molecules that Lcross scooped out of the Cabeus crater, near the Moon's south pole. Lying in perpetual darkness, the bottom of Cabeus, at minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit, is among the coldest places in the solar system and acts as a ''cold trap,'' collecting a history of impacts and debris over perhaps a couple of billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is quite a reservoir of our cosmic climate,'' said Peter H. Schultz, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University and lead author of one of the Science papers. ''It reflects things that hit the Moon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By analyzing the spectrum of infrared light reflected off the debris plume, Dr. Schultz and his colleagues identified elements like sodium and silver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instruments on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, also watching the impact, identified other compounds, like calcium, magnesium and mercury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the multitude of minerals, scientists can examine the relative abundances and start speculating about what sorts of objects have been hitting the Moon. Some material looks very similar to what is found in comets. Other minerals look like what is produced by chemical reactions that occur on very cold surfaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's really exciting to me is that Cabeus could be a comet impact site,'' Dr. Colaprete said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lcross and the lunar orbiter are part of NASA's Constellation program, started five years ago by the Bush administration to send astronauts back to the Moon. Arguing that it is too expensive and that the United States has already been there, President Obama has pushed for its cancellation. A compromise on the space agency's future, passed by Congress and signed into law by Mr. Obama last week, sets aside Moon ambitions for now, at least for the return of human explorers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schultz hopes that study of the Moon will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the poles have just opened up a flurry of new questions,'' he said. ''I think it is a destiny that we will go there as humans. I hope it's not just for commercialization.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonoma, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FEW weeks ago, an asteroid almost 30 feet across and zipping along at 38,000 miles per hour flew 28,000 miles above Singapore. Why, you might reasonably ask, should non-astronomy buffs care about a near miss from such a tiny rock? Well, I can give you one very good reason: asteroids don't always miss. If even a relatively little object was to strike a city, millions of people could be wiped out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to telescopes that can see ever smaller objects at ever greater distances, we can now predict dangerous asteroid impacts decades ahead of time. We can even use current space technology and fairly simple spacecraft to alter an asteroid's orbit enough to avoid a collision. We simply need to get this detection-and-deflection program up and running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has already announced a goal of landing astronauts on an asteroid by 2025 as a precursor to a human mission to Mars. Asteroids are deep-space bodies, orbiting the Sun, not the Earth, and traveling to one would mean sending humans into solar orbit for the very first time. Facing those challenges of radiation, navigation and life support on a months-long trip millions of miles from home would be a perfect learning journey before a Mars trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near-Earth objects like asteroids and comets -- mineral-rich bodies bathed in a continuous flood of sunlight -- may also be the ultimate resource depots for the long-term exploration of space. It is fantastic to think that one day we may be able to access fuel, materials and even water in space instead of digging deeper and deeper into our planet for what we need and then dragging it all up into orbit, against Earth's gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, our asteroid efforts may be the key to the survival of millions, if not our species. That's why planetary defense has occupied my work with two nonprofits over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, no one has ever seen the sort of impact that would destroy a city. The most instructive incident took place in 1908 in the remote Tunguska region of Siberia, when a 120-foot-diameter asteroid exploded early one morning. It probably killed nothing except reindeer but it flattened 800 square miles of forest. Statistically, that kind of event occurs every 200 to 300 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, larger asteroids are even fewer and farther between -- but they are much, much more destructive. Just think of the asteroid seven to eight miles across that annihilated the dinosaurs (and 75 percent of all species) 65 million years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a readily achievable detection and deflection system we can avoid their same fate. Professional (and a few amateur) telescopes and radar already function as a nascent early warning system, working every night to discover and track those planet-killers. Happily, none of the 903 we've found so far seriously threaten an impact in the next 100 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although catastrophic hits are rare, enough of these objects appear to be or are heading our way to require us to make deflection decisions every decade of so. Certainly, when it comes to the far more numerous Tunguska-sized objects, to date we think we've discovered less than a half of 1 percent of the million or so that cross Earth's orbit every year. We need to pinpoint many more of these objects and predict whether they will hit us before it's too late to do anything other than evacuate ground zero and try to save as many lives as we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, how do we turn a hit into a miss? While there are technical details galore, the most sensible approach involves rear-ending the asteroid. A decade or so ahead of an expected impact, we would need to ram a hunk of copper or lead into an asteroid in order to slightly change its velocity. In July 2005, we crashed the Deep Impact spacecraft into comet Tempel 1 to learn more about comets' chemical composition, and this proved to be a crude but effective method.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be necessary to make a further refinement to the object's course. In that case, we could use a gravity tractor -- an ordinary spacecraft that simply hovers in front of the asteroid and employs the ship's weak gravitational attraction as a tow-rope. But we don't want to wait to test this scheme when potentially millions of lives are at stake. Let's rehearse, at least once, before performing at the Met!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has just recommended to Congress that NASA begin preparing a deflection capacity. In parallel, my fellow astronaut Tom Jones and I led the Task Force on Planetary Defense of the NASA Advisory Council. We released our report a couple of weeks ago, strongly urging that the financing required for this public safety issue be added to NASA's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is, surprisingly, not an expensive undertaking. Adding just $250 million to $300 million to NASA's budget would, over the next 10 years, allow for a full inventory of the near-Earth asteroids that could do us harm, and the development and testing of a deflection capacity. Then all we'd need would be an annual maintenance budget of $50 million to $75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By preventing dangerous asteroid strikes, we can save millions of people, or even our entire species. And, as human beings, we can take responsibility for preserving this amazing evolutionary experiment of which we and all life on Earth are a part.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $150 billion, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration could have sent astronauts back to the Moon. The Obama administration judged that too expensive, and in September, Congress agreed to cancel the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a fraction of that -- less than $200 million, along with about $250 million for a rocket -- NASA engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston say they can safely send a humanoid robot to the Moon. And they say they could accomplish that in a thousand days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, known as Project M, is almost a guerrilla effort within NASA, cooked up a year ago by Stephen J. Altemus, the chief engineer at Johnson. He tapped into discretionary money, pulled in engineers to work on it part time, and horse-traded with companies and other NASA units to undertake preliminary planning and tests. ''We're doing impossible things with really very little, if any, money whatsoever,'' Mr. Altemus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A humanoid dextrous robot -- at least the top half -- already exists: Robonaut 2, developed by NASA and General Motors, is packed on the shuttle Discovery, scheduled for liftoff on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bound for the International Space Station, it will be the first humanoid robot in space. It is to help with housekeeping chores at the space station as NASA learns how astronauts and robots can work together. Eventually, an upgraded Robonaut is to take part in spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project M also draws on other NASA projects that were already under way, including rocket engines that burn liquid oxygen and methane -- a cheap and nontoxic fuel combination -- and an automated landing system that could avoid rocks, cliffs and other hazards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Integrating the technologies into working prototypes sped up development. ''That's the magic,'' Mr. Altemus said. ''A lot of times technologies end up in the lab cooking, and then there's this valley of death where they never get to maturation or to flight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project M's planners say that a robot walking on the Moon would capture the imagination of students, just as the Apollo Moon landings inspired a generation of scientists and engineers 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think that's going to light a few candles,'' said Neil Milburn, vice president of Armadillo Aerospace, a tiny Texas company working on Project M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as NASA's attention turns away from the Moon -- ''We've been there before,'' President Obama declared in April -- the prospects for sending a robot there are at best uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quandary over Project M encapsulates many of the continuing debates over the future of the space agency: What should NASA be told to do when there is not enough money to do everything? What is the best way to spur advances in space technologies? And given the costs and dangers, how important is it to send people into space at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tricky part is whether it fits in the agency's framework for exploration,'' Mr. Altemus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a blue-ribbon panel was reviewing NASA's human spaceflight program, in particular an ambitious project called Constellation to send astronauts back to the Moon. Although NASA has spent $10 billion on Constellation, most of the program is to be canceled when Congress finishes work on the 2011 budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Altemus, for one, was frustrated by criticism of NASA that emerged during the Constellation debate and elsewhere. ''I always felt like our organization was a Ferrari, and we were never allowed to drive with our foot on the gas,'' he said. ''We were kind of at idle speed all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talking to his son at his kitchen table, Mr. Altemus wanted something that was exciting but not so big that it would require years of deliberation. The idea popped into his head: a walking robot on the Moon, one that could send back live video, in a thousand days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Altemus took it to his staff the next day, telling them, ''Let's do something amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recalled: ''I said, 'Will you get behind me if I put this into the organization? I don't know if we can do it. I don't know if we'll get the money for it or will get approved -- let's try.' And so we just started, and it caught like wildfire.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sending a robot to the Moon is far easier than sending a person. For one, a robot does not need air or food. And there is no return trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thousand-day deadline was arbitrary, said R. Matthew Ondler, Project M's manager. ''It creates this sense of urgency,'' he explained. ''NASA is at its best when it has a short time to figure out things. You give us six or seven years to think about something, and we're not so good. Administrations change and priorities of the country change, and so it's hard to sustain things for that long.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the purpose of aiding science education, a thousand days fit easily into the four years that a student spends in high school or college. By contrast, even if NASA achieved Mr. Obama's stated goal of sending astronauts to an asteroid by 2025, a 7-year-old today would have already graduated from college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get the parts they need, Mr. Altemus and Mr. Ondler have resorted to barter. Boston Power gave them a $300,000 prototype of an advanced lithium battery in exchange for engineering help on battery management issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an easy trade, so we made several deals like that,'' Mr. Ondler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armadillo provided a prototype it had built for a lunar lander competition, and NASA exchanged engine technology and access to test facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA also paid Armadillo about $1 million, but NASA's traditional development processes would have cost more and taken longer. In six months, the lander flew 18 times under tether and twice in free flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all the flights went perfectly, which was the point. ''It's O.K. to put a hole in the ground once in a while,'' Mr. Ondler said. ''It's O.K. to have flame coming out of the wrong end of the engine once in a while, as long as we're learning quickly and building and iterating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ondler told the story of an engineer going to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> to buy about $80 worth of materials to test whether fuel sloshing in the tanks could destabilize the lander during descent. ''From that, we were able to confirm our math models and design the full-scale test,'' he said, all in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project M slipped under the radar of everyone else in NASA, including the administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr. In February, in response to a question about projects that NASA might undertake with other nations, General Bolden cited a two-legged robot that the Japanese space agency wants to send to the Moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do I think I can do that?'' General Bolden said. ''Probably not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, the Project M team was hoping to get a go-ahead to start in March and accomplish the robotic Moon landing by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the sophistication of the project, the robot's capabilities would be slight compared with what a human could do on the lunar surface. Project M was conceived as a technology demonstration, not a scientific mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main tasks envisioned for the robot would be to simply pick up a rock and drop it, as part of an education program broadcast to schools. Students could do the same and compare the relative gravity of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work continues on Project M, which has cost about $9 million so far. Armadillo is building a second prototype lander, but there is no money for other aspects, like finishing the legs for Robonaut. Mr. Obama's vision for NASA called for investing $16 billion over five years for space technologies, but the compromise blueprint drawn up by Congress shifts most of the money to a heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project did spark interest among the International Space Station managers, which is why a Robonaut is heading there. ''I'm excited to see how we can evolve the technology in space and actually have a pair of hands and a working humanoid dextrous robot on the space station,'' Mr. Altemus said. ''It's a big move forward for the agency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, the plans for sending one to the Moon are on the back burner.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years after NASA set off interplanetary fireworks by slamming an 800-pound bullet into a comet, the same spacecraft that fired that bullet will be visiting a second comet on Thursday, this time without the collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traveling 27,000 miles per hour, the spacecraft, left over from the Deep Impact mission, will come within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 on Thursday at 9:50 a.m. Eastern time. Hartley 2 will be only the fifth comet to be photographed close up, and the event will make the spacecraft the first to have visited two comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is going to give us the most extensive observation of a comet to date,'' said Timothy W. Larson, the project manager for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary mission of Deep Impact, launched in January 2005, was to visit Comet Tempel 1. As the spacecraft neared, it separated into two pieces -- the main spacecraft, about the size of a subcompact car, and the 800-pound impactor, which crashed into the comet on July 4, 2005. From a spray of ice and dust gouged from the comet, scientists were able to identify some of the minerals beneath its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets are of particular interest to planetary scientists because they contain almost pristine ingredients from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the crash, the part of Deep Impact that did not slam into the Tempel 1 still had plenty of propellant left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The spacecraft was still in good shape, willing to do more work,'' Dr. Larson said. ''It just needed a new reason for living.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA approved a new mission called Epoxi. The name is a combination of two acronyms: Epoch, or Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization, which has been using one of the spacecraft's cameras to look at stars known to have planets, and Dixi, or Deep Impact Extended Investigation, for the second comet flyby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft was sent on a looping path to intersect Comet Boethin in 2008. Boethin, a mile-wide comet with a 11.8-year orbit, had been visible during its previous passes into the inner solar system, most recently in 1986. But when astronomers looked for it in late 2007, it was nowhere to be seen. Boethin had apparently broken into smaller pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not wanting to send Epoxi to visit a comet that no longer existed, the mission team shifted to Hartley 2, which required an additional two years to reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft has taken 2,000 pictures a day of Hartley 2 as it approaches. The spacecraft cannot keep its high-speed antenna pointed at Earth and its cameras pointed at the comet at the same time. So during its closest approach, the spacecraft will focus on the comet for 18 consecutive hours before turning back to Earth to radio the data. Michael F. A'Hearn, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland and the mission's principal investigator, said Hartley 2 would help scientists understand whether what they learned at Tempel 1 was common among comets or peculiar to that comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three-quarters of a mile wide, Hartley 2 is much smaller than the four-mile-wide Tempel 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite that, it puts out more gas,'' Dr. A'Hearn said. ''This says it's a real active nucleus for its size.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, NASA's other comet spacecraft, Stardust, which flew by Comet Wild 2 in 2006 and caught some grains of dust that it later parachuted to Earth for scientists to study, is also being recycled for another comet encounter. On Feb. 14 next year, it will fly by Tempel 1, the comet that Deep Impact bombarded.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An electrical problem cropped up aboard the space shuttle Discovery again on Tuesday in Cape Canaveral after engineers thought they had it fixed, and delayed the shuttle's final liftoff to Thursday from Wednesday. The trouble appeared to be with a backup controller for one of the shuttle's three main engines. The controller was sluggish early on Tuesday morning, but shuttle officials found everything to be fine. Later, voltage irregularities were noted, prompting NASA to order last-minute reviews. The shuttle was supposed to blast off Monday for the last time on a trip to the International Space Station, but gas leaks forced a two-day delay.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fly-by of a comet went off flawlessly Thursday morning, giving giddy scientists only their fifth close-up look at the nucleus of a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft passed within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 about 10 a.m. Eastern time. Soon after, it turned its high-speed antenna toward Earth to beam back the photos it had taken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People at mission control at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., cheered when the signal from the spacecraft came in and cheered again as the pictures popped up on their computer screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first ones, taken hours earlier while the spacecraft was tens of thousands of miles from Hartley 2, showed a small white dot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they saw several images taken near its closest approach and marveled at odd shape of Hartley 2, which seemed to resemble a peanut or a bowling pin flying through space. Rays of gas and dust were shooting off its surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are all holding our breath to see what discoveries await us in the observations near closest approach,'' Michael A'Hearn, a University of Maryland astronomer and the mission's principal investigator, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Deep Impact spacecraft officially completed its mission in 2005 after it visited the comet Tempel 1, letting loose an 800-pound piece of equipment that crashed into that comet as it passed by. The collision allowed scientists to identify some of the minerals beneath the surface of Tempel 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spacecraft still had plenty of maneuvering fuel left, so NASA approved a second mission, called Epoxi, that included a visit to a second comet. Three years ago, the mission had to shift course when the comet it was aiming for, Comet Boethin, could not be found. The backup target was Hartley 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The odd shape of Hartley 2 could mean that the comet, three-quarters of a mile wide, was originally two objects that somehow spiraled into each other and stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comets are believed to contain primordial materials that date back to the beginning of the solar system, some 4.5 billion years ago. ''If we understand the comets really well, it will tell us how the planets got made,'' Dr. A'Hearn said. ''That's why we choose comets to study.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Epoxi is a combination of two acronyms: Epoch, or Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization, which has been using one of the spacecraft's cameras to look at stars known to have planets, and Dixi, or Deep Impact Extended Investigation, for the second comet fly-by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on Earth, NASA had less luck with the space shuttle Discovery, which was originally scheduled to launch on Monday but has been delayed by various setbacks. Most recently, bad weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida postponed the launching to Friday afternoon at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-day mission, which will take supplies to the International Space Station, is to be the 39th and last flight of the Discovery as the space shuttle program winds down.</p>

</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM HARWOOD   </div><div>499 words</div><div>6 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The shuttle Discovery, already delayed three times by technical problems and bad weather, was grounded again Friday, this time by a potentially dangerous gaseous hydrogen leak in a vent line attached to the ship's external tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery was initially scheduled to make its 39th and final flight last Monday, bearing fresh supplies and an intelligent robot for the International Space Station. But complications delayed the flight from Monday to Friday, when the hydrogen leak led NASA to conclude that the shuttle would not be ready to launch before its flight window closed this Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost at the same time that NASA managers were deciding to delay another attempt until Nov. 30, the opening of the next available launching window, engineers spotted a 7-inch-long crack in protective foam insulation on the side of the giant tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crack, on the side of the tank facing the Discovery, represented a possible source of debris that could have posed a threat to the shuttle's fragile heat shield during the climb out of the dense lower atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said the crack would have been spotted during normal prelaunching inspections and most likely would have prompted a delay even if the hydrogen leak had not developed. In the end, senior NASA managers decided to take the time needed to make sure the problems were well understood and repaired before making another attempt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will come back in late November and give it another shot,'' said Michael Leinbach, the launching director. ''We're going to fly when we're ready, and clearly we were not ready to fly today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's six-member crew -- Cmdr. Steven W. Lindsey; Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force, the shuttle pilot; Col. Benjamin A. Drew Jr., also of the Air Force; Col. Timothy L. Kopra of the Army; Nicole P. Stott; and Dr. Michael R. Barratt, a physician-astronaut -- flew back to Houston after the launching scrub was announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is attempting an 11-day mission to deliver critical supplies and equipment to the International Space Station. It will be loaded with a new cargo module, more than 6,000 pounds of supplies and equipment and a spare set of cooling system radiators that will be stored outside the lab complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of temperature issues related to the space station's orbit, NASA will have only about one week, from Nov. 30 through Dec. 5 or 6, to get the Discovery off the ground this year. Otherwise, the flight could be delayed until late February, throwing a wrench into NASA's plans for carrying out a final three missions and retiring the shuttle fleet by next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Discovery's not going out easy,'' Mr. Leinbach joked earlier in the week. ''She's giving us a little bit of trouble. But that's fine -- she'll fly perfectly when she does.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, 2011 will be another tumultuous year for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration: its space shuttles will be retired, and it will have to wrangle with Congress and the Obama administration over a rocket and a destination for the United States' human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space, though, NASA will have a less contentious time pursuing its science missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planetary scientists will finally get their first extended look at Mercury. After a trip of six and a half years through the inner solar system, NASA's Messenger spacecraft will finally pull into orbit around Mercury on March 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft has zoomed past Mercury three times, its camera photographing about 98 percent of the surface. Its other instruments have collected intriguing data regarding the magnetic field and the tenuous atmosphere of molecules that are blasted off the planet's surface by the Sun's radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But each of those fly-bys lasted just hours, while the orbital phase of the mission will go on for at least a year. That will allow Messenger to gather enough data to identify elements and minerals in the rocks on Mercury and to observe changes in the atmosphere and magnetic fields as the Sun's 11-year sunspot cycle emerges from its quiet period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got the instruments to do that, but we need time in orbit,'' said Sean C. Solomon, the principal investigator of the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most intriguing is what Messenger will find when it peers into craters near Mercury's poles. The day side of Mercury reaches 800 degrees Fahrenheit, but within the shadows of the polar craters, where the Sun never shines, temperatures are thought to be around minus 300 degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means there could be large deposits of water ice on Mercury. Radar measurements from Earth have already given suggestions of water, but some scientists believe that the deposits could instead be sulfur or silicates, which could produce the same radar results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We hope to have great fun,'' Dr. Solomon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the space shuttle front, NASA hopes to launch Discovery for a final time at the end of this month, carrying supplies to the International Space Station. In February, the shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to make the same trip, bringing up the final piece of the station, a particle physics experiment known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. And then, finally, the space station, already occupied for a decade, will be complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, the six people living there will be able to focus more on what is to be the primary mission for the next decade: a zero-gravity science laboratory. So far, experiments on the station have produced a stream of interesting but not Earth-shaking results, and many scientists criticize the $100 billion cost as money that could have been better spent on research on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie A. Robinson, the program scientist for the space station, said that was unfair, akin to criticizing a 20-year-old for all the time and cost of parenting and college and not yet living up to his or her career potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's exactly where the space station is,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''The fact is, we've done relatively little research on the space station.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, more attention will turn to whether the experiments -- which include growing crystals, studying the bone loss experienced by the inhabitants, and looking at how combustion occurs differently without gravity -- pay off for the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mars, scientists will be looking to NASA's once-and-future rovers, including vehicles that landed there nearly seven years ago and may or may not have life left in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vigil continues for the Spirit, the rover that may already be dead. Trapped in sand, it fell silent this year when its solar panels could no longer produce enough electricity as the Martian winter approached and days shortened. The Spirit will probably never move again, but could still prove valuable as a stationary science outpost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that the rover was able to conserve enough energy to keep its heaters running and that, as the days lengthen again, it will revive and get back in touch with Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At some point, you start to worry when you haven't heard from it,'' said John Callas, the project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Spirit is still silent come March and April, when its solar panels should be producing the greatest amount of energy, then hope will start fading. Still, the mission has already been a remarkable success for a machine that was designed to last only three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the other rover currently on Mars, the Opportunity, should be nearing its next destination, a huge crater named Endeavour, by the end of next year. It has been on a three-year drive covering about a dozen miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Opportunity survives that long, it will be able to investigate terrain that is deeper -- and hence, older -- in Mars's past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's next Mars rover, Curiosity, is to blast off late in 2011. Technical difficulties during its development have delayed the launching for two years, but it is expected to get to Mars about eight months after liftoff, providing planetary scientists with the most detailed exploration to date of the Martian surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size and weight of a small S.U.V., Curiosity dwarfs the Opportunity and Spirit rovers. Its instruments include a laser that will vaporize pieces of rocks and then identify minerals from the colors in the resulting smoke.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both planetary science and cosmology are ripe for big news in 2011, the former in its effort to find planets beyond the Earth and the solar system that could harbor water and thus life as we know it, and the latter in the unending effort to figure out what the universe is made of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding out how common habitable planets are around Sun-like stars is the mission of NASA's Kepler satellite, which has been trailing the Earth's orbit of the Sun ever since its launching in March 2009, staring at 156,000 stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra looking for telltale blips in starlight caused by planets passing in front of them. Last June, the Kepler team released a list of 350 stars thought to be harboring planets, but at the same time, and over the protests of some astronomers, they held back the data on 400 more stars that they wanted to check out over the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the Kepler 400 are expected to be released. The smallest planet on the previous list was about one and a half times the diameter of the Earth. The Kepler scientists will not say anything about the stars on the withheld list or their candidate planets, but in an e-mail message Natalie Batalha, a co-investigator on Kepler, said it would not be unreasonable to suspect that there is a smattering of planet candidates smaller than that on the new list. More small planets could also show up as more data is analyzed, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of an Earth-size planet would be another step on a path that planet hunters have been following for the past 15 years, since the first exoplanet was discovered. About 500 exoplanets are now known, but most of these have been giant ones circling too close to their stars, because they are easiest to find. As techniques have been refined, smaller planets have come into view, and a recent survey by University of California astronomers, Andrew Howard and Geoffrey Marcy, concluded that about a quarter of all Sun-like stars should have Earth-size planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If indeed there are Earth-size planets in the Kepler 400, however, Dr. Batalha and others hasten to point out, these would not quite be the planets of our dreams. An Earth-like planet -- that is to say, one that is the right temperature for water and thus life as we know it -- would take about a year to complete a circuit around a star like the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler would be lucky to have seen even one blip from a planet in such an orbit in the data analyzed so far and would need an additional year or two to record enough blips to determine that it was indeed in a habitable, water-friendly orbit around a star like our Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called habitable zone around a smaller dimmer star would be smaller, however, and a planet in that zone would complete its orbits more quickly, fast enough to have produced several blips noticeable by Kepler. In September, there was a flurry of excitement when a team of planet hunters led by Steven Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, announced it had detected a small planet, Gliese 581g, in the habitable zone of a dim red star in the constellation Libra. But enthusiasm cooled when a rival team of veteran planet hunters from the University of Geneva said it couldn't find the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Batalha said that if the Gliese planet were in Kepler's patch of sky and did transit its star, the Kepler spacecraft would have seen it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Earth, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider will enjoy the accelerator's first full year of banging protons together in search of new secrets of nature. On top of Haleakala in Hawaii, the biggest digital camera ever built, with 1,400 megapixels, on a telescope known as Pan-Starrs 1, will continue scanning the sky for killer asteroids -- in that case no news is good news -- and anything else that goes bump in the cosmic night. Another large camera, known as the Dark Energy Survey, will swing into action at a mountaintop observatory in Chile, looking to discern the effects of dark energy on the history and evolution of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any day now, the mystery particle that is presumed to make up the dark matter that amounts to a quarter of creation, and which provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies, could pop out of the collider and leave its tracks in one of a number of underground detectors. Or it could signal its presence in space by high-energy emanations recorded by experiments like NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope or the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a sophisticated cosmic ray detector that will be installed on the International Space Station next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A European satellite called Planck will continue its mission, begun in 2009, of surveying a cosmic radio haze left over from the Big Bang for clues to the origin and structure of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Hubble Space Telescope, rejuvenated by on-orbit surgery a year and a half ago, will keep scrutinizing the heavens with its matchless clarity, sifting eternity pixel by pixel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quest goes on, although the role and surely the leadership of American science in it is uncertain. Incoming Republicans have already signaled their desire to whack discretionary spending, which includes nonmilitary research, back to 2008 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would pretty much undo the America Competes Act, which aimed at doubling research funds for a number of government agencies over five years; it was first passed in 2007 and reauthorized by the House of Representatives last summer but is still awaiting a vote in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might be a long wait.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JAMES GORMAN   </div><div>1078 words</div><div>9 November 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a fool's errand to make precise predictions about the future. Even the famously prescient often fall on their faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1945, for example, Arthur C. Clarke suggested with astounding foresight that orbiting communications satellites would someday mimic Earth's rotation. But he also predicted that humans would land on Mars in 1994, that the last coal mine would be closed in 2006 and that in 2009, electronic monitoring would mean the end of professional criminals. He had to be kidding about the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I was first tempted to make specific predictions for 2011, I wisely resisted my own worst impulses. Then I thought, Why not predict what won't happen? Of course, predicting what won't happen can backfire, too. In 1920 The New York Times ridiculed the idea of the scientist Robert H. Goddard that rockets could leave the surface of the Earth. The newspaper published a correction on July 17, 1969, after the Apollo crew began its journey to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm restricting myself to 2011, mostly, and I've got a lot of confidence in the 9 predictions that follow. In fact, I'll bet the house on them. Of course, the mortgage comes with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here goes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011 human beings will not evolve, much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oh, I know, we recently evolved the ability to digest milk sugar. Milk sugar? What ever happened to really big evolutionary changes, like giant, bald heads with huge brains and extrasensory perception, or flippers and gills so we could live underwater in the New Atlantis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a year isn't much time to evolve gills, given that we take so long to reproduce and grow up, so I'll extend this prediction to 2111.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We will not find any good-size life in outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At best we'll get something microscopic. But I don't foresee us finding anything big enough to see with the naked eye. And that's what people want -- not intelligent life, just something that moves around, maybe hops up and down, and makes some kind of noise (purring would be nice).</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something big is going on at the center of the galaxy, and astronomers are happy to say they don't know what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of scientists working with data from NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope said Tuesday that they had discovered two bubbles of energy erupting from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The bubbles, they said at a news conference and in a paper to be published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal, extend 25,000 light years up and down from each side of the galaxy and contain the energy equivalent to 100,000 supernova explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're big,'' said Doug Finkbeiner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, leader of the team that discovered them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The source of the bubbles is a mystery. One possibility is that they are fueled by a wave of star births and deaths at the center of the galaxy. Another option is a gigantic belch from the black hole known to reside, like Jabba the Hutt, at the center of the Milky Way. What it is apparently not is dark matter, the mysterious something that astronomers say makes up a quarter of the universe and holds galaxies together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wow,'' said David Spergel, an astrophysicist at Princeton who was not involved in the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And we think we know a lot about our own galaxy,'' Dr. Spergel added, noting that the bubbles were almost as big as the galaxy and yet unsuspected until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, head of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, said, ''This shows again that the universe is full of surprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most surprised was Dr. Finkbeiner. A year ago he was part of a group led by Gregory Dobler of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., that said it had discerned the existence of a mysterious fog of high-energy particles buzzing around the center of the Milky Way. The particles manifested themselves as a haze of extra energy after all the known sources of gamma rays -- the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation -- had been subtracted from Fermi data that had recently been made public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Dr. Finkbeiner and his colleagues speculated that the haze was produced by dark matter. The center of the galaxy is home to all manner of wild and woolly high-energy phenomena, including a gigantic black hole and violently spinning pulsars, but cosmological theories also suggest that dark matter would be concentrated there. Collisions of dark matter particles, the theory goes, could produce showers of gamma rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the follow-up analysis, the haze -- besides being bigger than Dr. Finkbeiner and his colleagues had thought -- turned out to have sharp boundaries, like, well, a bubble. Dark matter, according to the prevailing theory, should be more diffuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dark matter has been there billions of years,'' Dr. Finkbeiner explained. ''If something has been going on for billions of years, you wouldn't expect a sharp edge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and the other scientists said this did not mean that dark matter was not there clogging the center of the galaxy, but that it would be harder to see.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, designed to peer to the edges of the universe and beginning of time, is running about one-third over its $5 billion budget and more than a year behind schedule, an independent review panel reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The James Webb Space Telescope, which already consumes 40 percent of the astrophysics budget at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will actually end up costing $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion, the panel said, and the earliest launching date would be September 2015. NASA gave the go-ahead for the telescope in 2008 expecting that it would be launched in June 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line was that there was just not enough money in the budget to execute the work that was required,'' said the review panel's leader, John R. Casani, a former project manager for NASA's successful Voyager, Galileo and Cassini missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report raised fear that other projects would be hurt. ''This is NASA's Hurricane Katrina,'' said Alan P. Boss, who leads the subcommittee that advises NASA's astrophysics program. The telescope, he said, ''will leave nothing but devastation in the astrophysics division budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope, equipped with a 21-foot-wide mirror and floating almost a million miles above the night side of the Earth, is designed to gather faint infrared light that emanated from the farthest, earliest stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is in good shape technically, the panel said. But it said the Webb project managers had failed to make realistic estimates of the costs and schedule. The report placed further blame on NASA headquarters for not catching the flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Casani said that to meet at 2015 launching date the project would need increases of more than $200 million in both 2011 and 2012, and that panel was not able to come up with suggestions for reducing the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher J. Scolese, NASA's associate administrator, said agency officials agreed with the report's findings and were working to adopt its recommendations, including a better management structure. Richard Howard, the agency's deputy chief technologist, will become the program manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scolese said the agency would devise a new schedule and budget for the telescope and look for where the money would come from. ''We have more homework to do on this,'' he said. But he added, ''I doubt we're going to find $200 million'' to add to the project for 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel and its report followed budget overruns of $95 million in fiscal year 2009 and $20 million in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who leads the appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA, requested the review in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter on Wednesday to the NASA administrator, Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., Ms. Mikulski wrote of ''dismay'' of the poor management and inadequate budgeting that the panel reported. ''We cannot afford to continue with business as usual in this stark fiscal situation,'' she wrote.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TASIILAQ, Greenland -- With a tense pilot gripping the stick, the helicopter hovered above the water, a red speck of machinery lost in a wilderness of rock and ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the right, a great fjord stretched toward the sea, choked with icebergs. To the left loomed one of the immense glaciers that bring ice from the top of the Greenland ice sheet and dump it into the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hanging out the sides of the craft, two scientists sent a measuring device plunging into the water, between ice floes. Near the bottom, it reported a temperature of 40 degrees. It was the latest in a string of troubling measurements showing that the water was warm enough to melt glaciers rapidly from below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the highest we've seen this far up the fjord,'' said one of the scientists, Fiammetta Straneo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The temperature reading was a new scrap of information in the effort to answer one of the most urgent -- and most widely debated -- questions facing humanity: How fast is the world's ice going to melt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists long believed that the collapse of the gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica would take thousands of years, with sea level possibly rising as little as seven inches in this century, about the same amount as in the 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But researchers have recently been startled to see big changes unfold in both Greenland and Antarctica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of recent calculations that take the changes into account, many scientists now say that sea level is likely to rise perhaps three feet by 2100 -- an increase that, should it come to pass, would pose a threat to coastal regions the world over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the calculations suggest that the rise could conceivably exceed six feet, which would put thousands of square miles of the American coastline under water and would probably displace tens of millions of people in Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists say that a rise of even three feet would inundate low-lying lands in many countries, rendering some areas uninhabitable. It would cause coastal flooding of the sort that now happens once or twice a century to occur every few years. It would cause much faster erosion of beaches, barrier islands and marshes. It would contaminate fresh water supplies with salt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, parts of the East Coast and Gulf Coast would be hit hard. In New York, coastal flooding could become routine, with large parts of Queens and Brooklyn especially vulnerable. About 15 percent of the urbanized land in the Miami region could be inundated. The ocean could encroach more than a mile inland in parts of North Carolina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abroad, some of the world's great cities -- London, Cairo, Bangkok, Venice and Shanghai among them -- would be critically endangered by a three-foot rise in the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate scientists readily admit that the three-foot estimate could be wrong. Their understanding of the changes going on in the world's land ice is still primitive. But, they say, it could just as easily be an underestimate as an overestimate. One of the deans of American coastal studies, Orrin H. Pilkey of Duke University, is advising coastal communities to plan for a rise of at least five feet by 2100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we need immediately to begin thinking about our coastal cities -- how are we going to protect them?'' said John A. Church, an Australian scientist who is a leading expert on sea level. ''We can't afford to protect everything. We will have to abandon some areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea-level rise has been a particularly contentious element in the debate over global warming. One published estimate suggested the threat was so dire that sea level could rise as much as 15 feet in this century. Some of the recent work that produced the three-foot projection was carried out specifically to counter more extreme calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global warming skeptics, on the other hand, contend that any changes occurring in the ice sheets are probably due to natural climate variability, not to greenhouse gases released by humans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such doubts have been a major factor in the American political debate over global warming, stalling efforts by Democrats and the Obama administration to pass legislation that would curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. Similar legislative efforts are likely to receive even less support in the new Congress, with many newly elected legislators openly skeptical about climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large majority of climate scientists argue that heat-trapping gases are almost certainly playing a role in what is happening to the world's land ice. They add that the lack of policies to limit emissions is raising the risk that the ice will go into an irreversible decline before this century is out, a development that would eventually make a three-foot rise in the sea look trivial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melting ice is by no means the only sign that the earth is warming. Thermometers on land, in the sea and aboard satellites show warming. Heat waves, flash floods and other extreme weather events are increasing. Plants are blooming earlier, coral reefs are dying and many other changes are afoot that most climate scientists attribute to global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the rise of the sea could turn out to be the single most serious effect. While the United States is among the countries at greatest risk, neither it nor any other wealthy country has made tracking and understanding the changes in the ice a strategic national priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consequence is that researchers lack elementary information. They have been unable even to measure the water temperature near some of the most important ice on the planet, much less to figure out if that water is warming over time. Vital satellites have not been replaced in a timely way, so that American scientists are losing some of their capability to watch the ice from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The missing information makes it impossible for scientists to be sure how serious the situation is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a scientist, you have to stick to what you know and what the evidence suggests,'' said Gordon Hamilton, one of the researchers in the helicopter. ''But the things I've seen in Greenland in the last five years are alarming. We see these ice sheets changing literally overnight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodging Icebergs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the brilliant sunshine of a late summer day in southeastern Greenland, the pilot at the controls of the red helicopter, Morgan Goransson, dropped low toward the water. He used the downdraft from his rotor to clear ice from the surface of Sermilik Fjord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frigid waters were only 30 feet below, so any mechanical problem would have sent the chopper plunging into the sea. ''It is so dangerous,'' Mr. Goransson said later that night, over a fish dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking the temperature of waters near the ice sheet is essential if scientists are to make sense of what is happening in Greenland. But it is a complex and risky business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two scientists -- Dr. Straneo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and Dr. Hamilton, of the University of Maine -- are part of a larger team that has been traveling here every summer with financing from the National Science Foundation, the federal agency that sponsors much of the nation's most important research. Not only do they remove the doors of helicopters and lean over icy fjords to get their readings, but they dodge huge icebergs in tiny boats and traipse over glaciers scarred by crevasses that could swallow large buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reading that the scientists obtained a few weeks ago, of 40 degrees near the bottom of the fjord, fit a broader pattern that researchers have been detecting in the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water that originated far to the south, in warmer parts of the Atlantic Ocean, is flushing into Greenland's fjords at a brisk pace. Scientists suspect that as it melts the ice from beneath, the warm water is loosening the connection of the glaciers to the ground and to nearby rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect has been something like popping a Champagne cork, allowing the glaciers to move faster and dump more ice into the ocean. Within the past decade, the flow rate of many of Greenland's biggest glaciers has doubled or tripled. Some of them have eventually slowed back down, but rarely have they returned to their speed of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two seismologists, Meredith Nettles and Goran Ekstrom of Columbia University, discovered a few years ago that unusual earthquakes were emanating from the Greenland glaciers as they dumped the extra ice into the sea. ''It's remarkable that an iceberg can do this, but when that loss of ice occurs, it does generate a signal that sets up a vibration that you can record all across the globe,'' Dr. Nettles said in an interview in Greenland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyzing past records, they discovered that these quakes had increased severalfold from the level of the early 1990s, a sign of how fast the ice is changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellite and other measurements suggest that through the 1990s, Greenland was gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to the sea every year. But since then, the warmer water has invaded the fjords, and air temperatures in Greenland have increased markedly. The overall loss of ice seems to be accelerating, an ominous sign given that the island contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 20 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strictly speaking, scientists have not proved that human-induced global warming is the cause of the changes. They are mindful that the climate in the Arctic undergoes big natural variations. In the 1920s and '30s, for instance, a warm spell caused many glaciers to retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John R. Christy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is often critical of mainstream climate science, said he suspected that the changes in Greenland were linked to this natural variability, and added that he doubted that the pace would accelerate as much as his colleagues feared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For high predictions of sea-level rise to be correct, ''some big chunks of the Greenland ice sheet are going to have to melt, and they're just not melting that way right now,'' Dr. Christy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet other scientists say that the recent changes in Greenland appear more pervasive than those of the early 20th century, and that they are occurring at the same time that air and ocean temperatures are warming, and ice melt is accelerating, throughout much of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helheim Glacier, which terminates in Sermilik Fjord, is one of a group of glaciers in southeastern Greenland that have shown especially big changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent day, the red helicopter landed on a rocky outcrop above the glacier, a flowing river of ice about 25 miles long and nearly four miles wide. On the side of the canyon, Dr. Hamilton pointed toward a band of light-colored rock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was, in essence, a bathtub ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something caused the glacier, one of Greenland's largest, to speed up sharply in the middle of the last decade, and it spit so much ice into the ocean that it thinned by some 300 feet in a few years. A part of the canyon that was once shielded from the sun by ice was thus left exposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glacier has behaved erratically ever since, and with variations, that pattern is being repeated all over Greenland. ''All these changes are happening at a far faster pace than we would have ever predicted from our conventional theories,'' Dr. Hamilton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days after the helicopter trip, an old Greenlandic freighter nudged its way gingerly up Sermilik Fjord, which was so choked with ice that the boat had to stop well short of its goal. ''You have to be flexible to work out here,'' said the leader of the team that day, Dr. Straneo of Woods Hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon she was barking orders, and her team swung into motion. A cold, Arctic drizzle fell on the boat and the people. Off the port side in a rickety skiff, David Sutherland, a young scientist at the University of Washington, tossed a floating buoy, carrying a string of instruments, into the water, and an anchor snatched it below the surface. Over the next year, it will measure temperature, currents and other factors in the fjord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sutherland climbed back aboard the freighter with cold, wet feet. As the boat headed back to port, it passed icebergs the size of city blocks, chunks of the Greenland ice sheet bound for the open sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Ocean in Flux</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest reason to think that the level of the sea could undergo big changes in the future is that it has done so in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the waxing and waning of ice ages, driven by wobbles in the earth's orbit, sea level has varied by hundreds of feet, with shorelines moving many miles in either direction. ''We're used to the shoreline being fixed, and it's not,'' said Robin E. Bell, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at all times in the past, when the shoreline migrated, humans either had not evolved yet or consisted of primitive bands of hunter-gatherers who could readily move. By the middle of this century, a projected nine billion people will inhabit the planet, with many millions of them living within a few feet of sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To a majority of climate scientists, the question is not whether the earth's land ice will melt in response to the greenhouse gases those people are generating, but whether it will happen too fast for society to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent research suggests that the volume of the ocean may have been stable for thousands of years as human civilization has developed. But it began to rise in the 19th century, around the same time that advanced countries began to burn large amounts of coal and oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sea has risen about eight inches since then, on average. That sounds small, but on a gently sloping shoreline, such an increase is enough to cause substantial erosion unless people intervene. Governments have spent billions in recent decades pumping sand onto disappearing beaches and trying to stave off the loss of coastal wetlands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have been struggling for years to figure out if a similar pace of sea-level rise is likely to continue in this century -- or whether it will accelerate. In its last big report, in 2007, the United Nations group that assesses climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that sea level would rise at least seven more inches, and might rise as much as two feet, in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the group warned that these estimates did not fully incorporate ''ice dynamics,'' the possibility that the world's big ice sheets, as well as its thousands of smaller glaciers and ice caps, would start spitting ice into the ocean at a much faster rate than it could melt on land. Scientific understanding of this prospect was so poor, the climate panel said, that no meaningful upper limit could be put on the potential rise of sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That report prompted fresh attempts by scientists to calculate the effect of ice dynamics, leading to the recent, revised projections of sea-level rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satellite evidence suggests that the rise of the sea accelerated late in the 20th century, so that the level is now increasing a little over an inch per decade, on average -- about a foot per century. Increased melting of land ice appears to be a major factor. Another is that most of the extra heat being trapped by human greenhouse emissions is going not to warm the atmosphere but to warm the ocean, and as it warms, the water expands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the study of the world's land ice still in its early stages, scientists have lately been trying crude methods to figure out how much the pace might accelerate in coming decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One approach, pioneered by a German climate researcher named Stefan Rahmstorf, entails looking at the past relationship between the temperature of the earth and sea level, then making projections. Another, developed by a University of Colorado glaciologist named Tad Pfeffer, involves calculations about how fast the glaciers, if they keep speeding up, might be able to dump ice into the sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those two methods yield approximately the same answer: that sea level could rise by 2 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet between now and 2100. A developing consensus among climate scientists holds that the best estimate is a little over three feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculations about the effect of a three-foot increase suggest that it would cause shoreline erosion to accelerate markedly. In places that once flooded only in a large hurricane, the higher sea would mean that a routine storm could do the trick. In the United States, an estimated 5,000 square miles of dry land and 15,000 square miles of wetlands would be at risk of permanent inundation, though the actual effect would depend on how much money was spent protecting the shoreline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst effects, however, would probably occur in areas where land is sinking even as the sea rises. Some of the world's major cities, especially those built on soft sediments at the mouths of great rivers, are in that situation. In North America, New Orleans is the premier example, with large parts of the city already sitting several feet below sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defenses can be built to keep out the sea, of course, like the levees of the New Orleans region and the famed dikes of the Netherlands. But the expense is likely to soar as the ocean rises, and such defenses are not foolproof, as Hurricane Katrina proved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Storm surges battering the world's coastlines every few years would almost certainly force people to flee inland. But it is hard to see where the displaced would go, especially in Asia, where huge cities -- and even entire countries, notably Bangladesh -- are at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, scientists point out that if their projections prove accurate, the sea will not stop rising in 2100. By that point, the ice sheets could be undergoing extensive melting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Beyond a hundred years out, it starts to look really challenging,'' said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. ''You start thinking about every coastal city on the planet hiding behind a wall, with storms coming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Shortage of Satellites</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Saturday morning a few months back, a University of Colorado student named Scott Potter, sitting in a control room on the Boulder campus, typed a word into a computer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''GO.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next 40 seconds, indicators in the control room turned red. Alarms rang. Pagers buzzed. High above the earth, a satellite called ICESat, reacting to Mr. Potter's order, prepared itself to die.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commotion was expected. Mr. Potter, one of several Colorado students who hold part-time jobs as satellite controllers under professional supervision, was doing the bidding of NASA. His command that day formally ended the ICESat mission, which had produced crucial information about the world's ice sheets for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of August, two weeks after Mr. Potter sent his order, the remains of ICESat plunged into the Barents Sea, off the Russian coast. Its demise was seen by many climate researchers as a depressing symbol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade of budget cuts and shifting space priorities in Washington, several satellites vital to monitoring the ice sheets and other aspects of the environment are on their last legs, with no replacements at hand. A replacement for ICESat will not be launched until 2015 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are slowly going blind in space,'' said Robert Bindschadler, a polar researcher at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who spent 30 years with NASA studying ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several federal agencies and two presidential administrations, Democratic and Republican, have made decisions that contributed to the problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, an attempt by the Clinton and Bush administrations to combine certain military and civilian satellites ate up $5 billion before it was labeled a ''horrendous and costly failure'' by a Congressional committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A plan by President George W. Bush to return to the moon without allocating substantial new money squeezed budgets at NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Obama administration is seeking to chart a new course, abandoning the goal of returning to the moon and seeking a substantial increase in financing for earth sciences. It is also promising an overall strategy for improving the country's environmental observations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major elements of the administration's program won support from both parties on Capitol Hill and were signed into law recently, but amid a larger budget impasse, Congress has not allocated the money President Obama requested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, NASA is spending about $15 million a year to fly airplanes over ice sheets and glaciers to gather some information it can no longer get by satellite, and projects are under way in various agencies to plug some of the other information gaps. NASA has begun planning new satellites to replace the ones that are aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The missions that are being designed right now are fantastic,'' said Tom Wagner, who runs NASA's ice programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite difficulties are one symptom of a broader problem: because no scientifically advanced country has made a strategic priority of studying land ice, scientists lack elementary information that they need to make sense of what is happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They do not know the lay of the land beneath most of the world's glaciers, including many in Greenland, in sufficient detail to calculate how fast the ice might retreat. They have only haphazard readings of the depth and temperature of the ocean near Greenland, needed to figure out why so much warm water seems to be attacking the ice sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information problems are even more severe in Antarctica. Much of that continent is colder than Greenland, and its ice sheet is believed to be more stable, over all. But in recent years, parts of the ice sheet have started to flow rapidly, raising the possibility that it will destabilize in the same way that much of the world's other ice has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain measurements are so spotty for Antarctica that scientists have not been able to figure out whether the continent is losing or gaining ice. Scientists do not have good measurements of the water temperature beneath the massive, floating ice shelves that are helping to buttress certain parts of the ice sheet in West Antarctica. Since the base of the ice sheet sits below sea level in that region, it has long been thought especially vulnerable to a warming ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cavities beneath ice shelves and floating glaciers are difficult to reach, and scientists said that too little money had been spent to develop technologies that could provide continuing measurements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out whether Antarctica is losing ice over all is essential, because that ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea level by nearly 200 feet. The parts that appear to be destabilizing contain water sufficient to raise it perhaps 10 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist and head of that university's Center for the Environment, praised the scientists who do difficult work studying ice, but he added, ''The scale of what they can do, given the resources available, is just completely out of whack with what is required.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climate scientists note that while the science of studying ice may be progressing slowly, the world's emissions of heat-trapping gases are not. They worry that the way things are going, extensive melting of land ice may become inevitable before political leaders find a way to limit the gases, and before scientists even realize such a point of no return has been passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The past clearly shows that sea-level rise is getting faster and faster the warmer it gets,'' Dr. Rahmstorf said. ''Why should that process stop? If it gets warmer, ice will melt faster.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 16 years and $1.5 billion of other people's money, it is almost showtime for NASA and Sam Ting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting and being fussed over by technicians in a clean room at the Kennedy Space Center in preparation for a February launching -- and looking for all the world like a giant corrugated rain barrel -- is an eight-ton assemblage of magnets, wires, iron, aluminum, silicon and electronics that is one of the most ambitious and complicated experiments ever to set out for space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment, if it succeeds, could help NASA take a giant step toward answering the question of what the universe is made of. It could also confer scientific glory on both the International Space Station and a celebrated physicist reaching one last time, literally, for the stars. If it fails, it will validate critics who think it a scandal the experiment was ever approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The device, named the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, is designed to sift the high-energy particles flying through space known as cosmic rays. On Feb. 27, the space shuttleEndeavour will ferry the spectrometer to a permanent berth on the space station. But the real destination is the shadow universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think you learned in high school that the universe is made of atoms and molecules, protons and electrons, stars and galaxies, but over the last few decades astronomers have concluded -- not happily -- that all this is just a scrim overlying a much vaster shadowy realm of invisible ''dark matter'' whose gravity determines the architecture of the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they are lucky, scientists say, the Alpha spectrometer could confirm that mysterious signals recorded by other satellites and balloons in recent years are emanations from that dark matter, revealing evidence of particles and forces that have only been theoretical dreams until now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if dark matter won't ever become the ultimate diet -- eat it and disappear -- knowing what nature is made of could be useful someday in ways nobody can dream. Einstein's curved spacetime, equally elusive to the senses, proved crucial to the function of GPS devices that were invented decades after Einstein's death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or the device could find even something weirder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real discovery is outside the ring of existing knowledge,'' said Samuel Chao Chung Ting, the 74-year-old Nobel laureate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and leader of the cosmic ray project, in his laboratory at CERN outside Geneva in August. A few yards away, the hulking spectrometer was sitting in a test frame, being pinged by a beam of protons in final tests before being shipped to Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting, one of science's great control freaks and worrywarts, has spent his life commanding armies of physicists. In 1974 he discovered a particle that would revolutionize physics, but he took so long checking for errors and looking for more particles that another lab found it and he wound up splitting the Nobel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gazing at his spectrometer, almost ready for space at last, Dr. Ting shrugged off the question of what he had up his sleeve next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You must think I am really stupid,'' he said. ''You see how much trouble this was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment was born in the early 1990s when, despite his prestige, Dr. Ting failed to land a role on the largest physics machines ever contemplated, the Superconducting Supercollider (canceled before completion in 1993 by Congress) or the Large Hadron Collider (now operating at CERN, as the European Organization for Nuclear Research is known).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he turned his eyes to the heavens. According to the laws of physics, equal amounts of matter and its science-fiction-sounding evil twin, antimatter, which annihilates ordinary matter in a flash of energy upon contact, should have been created during the Big Bang. It is one of the abiding mysteries of science why the universe is now all matter. Or is it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of a single atomic nucleus heavier than anti-helium could mean there was an anti-star or maybe a whole anti-galaxy somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't do the measurement, you will never know,'' Dr. Ting said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1994 Dr. Ting told Dan Goldin, then NASA's administrator, that he could make that measurement with a space-based cosmic ray detector. Mr. Goldin was instantly smitten and agreed to put the spectrometer on the International Space Station, which was desperately lacking scientific credibility, bypassing the agency's normal peer-review procedures and setting off resentment among other cosmic-ray physicists that still lingers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the lure was that the space agency would not have to pay for it. The bulk would be paid for by Dr. Ting's army of collaborators abroad, which grew to 600 scientists from 16 countries, including Italy, Germany, Russia, China and Taiwan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, a prototype of the spectrometer was built and flown successfully on the space shuttle for 10 days on a trip to the Mir space station, although not without some Tingian drama. Behind in the construction schedule, Dr. Ting announced one day that he was canceling the Christmas break. ''Perhaps on Christmas Day we will take a few minutes to reflect,'' Peter Fisher, an M.I.T. physicist who was there, recalled Dr. Ting saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work got done on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle Columbia disintegrated in 2003, killing its crew of seven astronauts, Dr. Ting's fortunes took a turn for the worse. NASA decreed an early end to the shuttle era, and the Alpha spectrometer was dropped from the flight manifest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting fought back. In 2005, invited to address a Senate committee on the state of American science, he used his five minutes and nine transparencies to mount a rousing defense of basic science and of his experiment. ''They were surprised to hear that the space station can do good science,'' Dr. Ting recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the following years powerful senators like Ted Stevens of Alaska, Bill Nelson of Florida and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas sat through Dr. Ting's PowerPoint shows or visited the project at CERN. In the end, Congress ordered NASA to provide an extra shuttle flight for the experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three days after Barack Obama's inauguration, we were back on the manifest,'' Dr. Ting said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then nobody, with the possible exception of Dr. Ting, expected the experiment to find any primordial antimatter. Most theorists have concluded that it disappeared in the first moments after the Big Bang. ''The original goal has evaporated,'' said Greg Tarle, a cosmic-ray physicist at the University of Michigan and longtime critic of the experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the heavens were crackling with intimations of dark matter. Two years ago a European satellite named Pamela registered an excess of anti-electrons, or positrons, in space -- perhaps from collisions of dark matter particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that satellite had no way to tell positrons, which are exotic, from protons, which are humdrum, being the nuclei of hydrogen, and everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alpha spectrometer does. ''It will tell us whether these things are there or not,'' said John Ellis, a CERN theorist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectrometer is a miniature spacegoing version of the cathedral-size particle detectors that now line the Large Hadron Collider. At its heart was to be the most powerful magnet ever flown in space, a superconducting electromagnet like the ones in the collider, which would sort high energy particles according to their electrical charges and momenta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to some physicists, including Dr. Ellis and Dr. Ting, the positrons from dark matter should have a unique spectral signature that the cosmic ray spectrometer can measure. If the signal follows the model, Dr. Ting said, ''Everyone will believe it is dark matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say it will be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish the dark matter signal from the background violence of pulsars and black holes in the local universe. David Spergel, a Princeton astrophysicist, said, ''Cosmic rays are the dirtiest way of looking for dark matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many physicists say they will not be satisfied that dark matter has been found until there is supporting data from particle accelerators and underground experiments that seek to detect the particles directly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Burton Richter, who shared the Nobel with Dr. Ting in 1976, said, ''This was a good experiment when Sam proposed it; it's even hotter now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even Dr. Ting's supporters were nonplused by the latest twist in the Alpha experiment saga. Earlier this year, with a fall flight date finally secured, Dr. Ting announced he was ripping out the heart of his experiment and replacing his superconducting magnet with a weaker permanent magnet that had flown on the prototype flight. That meant he would miss the deadline for shipping the instrument to Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA promptly reshuffled the schedule and moved the flight to next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're Sam, you're allowed to show up at the airport a few seconds before your flight,'' Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting gave two main reasons for the last-minute change. Vacuum chamber tests in February revealed that the helium needed to keep the magnet cold and superconducting could run out in as little as two years. Refilling it in space was not an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, he said, the station's lifetime had been extended from 2015 to 2020 or 2028, and it would not be right to occupy space on the station for all those years with a dead experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weaker field of the permanent magnet, Dr. Ting said, would be more than offset by the longer time the equipment would be aloft and a slight redesign of the particle tracking arrays. Indeed, Dr. Ting called it an ''upgrade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the space station was coming down in 2015, we would not change the magnet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late change, however, led to renewed criticism from scientists who wondered if the experiment had been degraded or whether it was even safe to fly now. ''This project has been given some kind of pass on everything,'' said Dr. Tarle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle engineers, however, said they were relieved that they would not have to deal with liquid helium, which can vaporize explosively -- as it did in the Large Hadron Collider two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology, who had helped evaluate the project for the Department of Energy, said in an e-mail that despite the ''apparently flawed process'' by which the experiment had originally been approved, it should fly. ''I wouldn't bet against Sam,'' he added.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A peanut-shaped comet was spewing hundreds of pounds of fluffy ice chunks every second as a NASA spacecraft swung by it two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To me, this whole thing looks like a snow globe that you've simply just shaken,'' Peter H. Schultz, a Brown University professor working on the mission, said Thursday during a news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Deep Impact spacecraft passed within 435 miles of Comet Hartley 2 two weeks ago, producing a series of photographs that showed bright jets coming off a rough surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What fascinated the mission scientists most was that the chunks of water ice in the jets were not being lifted off the surface by the force of water vapor heated by the sun, but rather by jets of carbon dioxide. This was the first time that such carbon dioxide jets had been observed at a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frozen carbon dioxide -- dry ice -- turns to carbon dioxide gas at a temperature of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Water ice stays frozen until it reaches much higher temperatures. Thus, it appears that the carbon dioxide gas on the comet is blowing apart the still-frozen water ice, along with dust particles, and sending it into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists who analyzed the photos of Hartley 2 said that the frozen carbon dioxide within the comet must date from the beginnings of the solar system, because once it turns to gas, it disperses into space. ''If it's there, it's primordial,'' Lori M. Feaga, another member of the science team, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the bright specks seen in the images ranged in size from golf balls to perhaps basketballs, the spacecraft did not suffer any damage as it flew through the storm at a speed of 27,000 miles an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the absorption of light by the specks, the scientists deduced that the chunks were not solid ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not seeing hail-size softballs or even ice cubes,'' said Jessica M. Sunshine, a deputy principal investigator on the mission. ''What we're seeing are fluffy aggregates of very small pieces of ice. And so, they're akin more to maybe a dandelion puff that is very empty air that can be easily broken apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carbon dioxide jets are coming off the two lobe-shaped ends of the comet, which is just three-quarters of a mile long. The spacecraft also found large amounts of water vapor -- and not carbon dioxide -- emanating from the central narrow waist region between the two lobes. This may mean that, for reasons not yet deciphered, the middle part of the comet does not contain much carbon dioxide, and thus the water ice in it can warm into vapor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wouldn't expect this at all,'' Dr. Sunshine said. ''This comet is doing two things at once.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hartley 2 findings differ significantly from what the Deep Impact spacecraft found when it visited Comet Tempel 1 five years ago. At Tempel 1, Deep Impact found water vapor emissions similar to those coming from the middle of Hartley 2, but no carbon dioxide jets and no visible chunks of water ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the Tempel 1 visit, NASA decided to reuse the spacecraft, which still had ample maneuvering fuel left, to head to a second comet. The mission was renamed Epoxi, an amalgamation of two acronyms: Epoch, or Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization, which has been using one of the spacecraft's cameras to look at stars known to have planets, and Dixi, or Deep Impact Extended Investigation, for the second comet fly-by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has emphasized how different comets are from one another and how understanding them is a much more complex problem than the rather simplistic approach I like to normally take,'' said Michael F. A'Hearn, Epoxi's principal investigator.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note: When this puzzle is done, read the eight circled letters clockwise, starting with square No. 24, to identify this puzzle's theme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY'S PUZZLE - We're nearly at the end of the space shuttle era. Designed in the 1970s and first flown in 1981, these spacecraft finally retire next year after some 135 missions. They've had a record of remarkable scientific accomplishment and, in two cases, terrible disaster. In 1986, "No. 3" CHALLENGER blew up shortly after liftoff, and in 2003, "No. 2" COLUMBIA disintegrated while trying to land with a damaged heat shield. On the other hand, shuttle astronauts launched the Hubble Space Telescope 20 years ago and then made four service calls from 1993 to 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This might have been tricky for people who prefer science fiction to the messy rocket reality, but if you're a space geek like me, most of the inspirational theme answers probably popped in as soon as the theme was clear. "No. 5" ATLANTIS was named not for the mythical kingdom but for the Research Vessel R.V. Atlantis. "No. 1" ENTERPRISE with its obvious echo of a famous fictional starship was, in fact, named after the U.S.S. Enterprise (NCC-1701) that propelled Captain Kirk and his merry crew around the universe. Space scientists watch TV, too. By the way, the square to the left of No. 35 is supposed to be planet Earth with six circled letters orbiting around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performer called "The Great Dane" was Victor BORGE. He was a musician adored by word lovers, so he's always welcome in the grid. English was not his first language, so with the perspective of an outsider, he could point out the delicious oddities of our language that pass by native speakers. Comedians like to complain that musicians have a huge advantage: they can play the same songs every time they come back to town. Comics require fresh material. Nobody dreamily says, "Oh Martha, he's telling our joke." Mr. Borge was an exception. His concerts regularly recycled samples of the same finely honed repertoire, and everyone loved it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're on a bit of an Othello kick here at The Times. This is IAGO's fifth appearance this month, the second quoting his "I am not what I am" from the beginning of the play. Hands up if you had to write an essay about what that meant in high school. I like ANTENNA as the "Dish alternative." You can still see those forests of rooftop TV antennas in some neighborhoods. CeCe Winans is a gospel singer from Detroit. NANCI Griffith, on the other hand, is from Texas. You could probably guess that by listening to the video further down, but first let's hear from today's constructor:Notes from Allan E. ParrishI was born in Carmichaels, Pa., a small mining town about 50 miles south of Pittsburgh. I spent four years in the United States Air Force and then moved to northeast Ohio in the early 1970s, later graduating from Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. Although I'm a member of the Ohio Bar, I've never practiced law. I currently work at WELW radio in Willoughby, Ohio, about 25 miles east of Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many crossword creators, I'm always listening or looking for related items in groups of three or more. A few months ago, one of the WELW newscasts contained a brief shuttle-related story. A little bit of research revealed that there have been six shuttles, and I couldn't wait to get home that evening a start to work on constructing. Perhaps I shouldn't reveal this, but initially, I wasn't going to send the completed puzzle to The New York Times -- I figured it needed a title to make it work. But after a while, I decided that by circling the appropriate letters to spell "shuttles," it might be something that Will Shortz would like.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new planet the size of Jupiter with origins outside the Milky Way galaxy has been discovered, according to a study in the journal Science. The finding is important because the planet orbits a very old star that is nearing the end of its life span and may soon collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to study this and see how far the star can evolve until the whole planet is engulfed or destroyed,'' said Johny Setiawan, the study's lead author and an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. ''The most important thing is to understand how a planetary system evolves, and maybe our solar system will experience the same process in the next two or three billion years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star, known as HIP 13044, has been around for at least six billion years and has only several million years of life left, Dr. Setiawan said. Currently, the star and its planet are in the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The star has a low metallicity, which is a measure of elements other than hydrogen and helium. An abundance of metal is thought to help planets form, so it is surprising that the star has only about 1 percent of the metallicity of the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Metal helps form planetary embryos, and you need an embryo for the planet to pick up other materials and grow,'' Dr. Setiawan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear whether the planet ever had life forms, since it is a gaseous planet like Jupiter. Its distance from its host star is only a tenth of that between the Earth and the Sun, making life on any nearby planets that may exist virtually impossible because of high temperatures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers and astrophysicists have given us insight into what happened in the first trillionths-of-a-second after the Big Bang, nearly 14 billion years ago. But the current cosmological hypothesis is that before the Big Bang there was nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Roger Penrose, the eminent British mathematician, is arguing that there is physical evidence that may predate the Big Bang. In a recent paper, he and his co-author, the physicist V. G. Gurzadyan, describe a pattern of concentric circles detected against the universal backdrop of cosmic microwave radiation generated by the Big Bang. These circles, they say, may be gravitational waves generated by collisions of superbig black holes before the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two scientists go even further, claiming that the evidence also suggests that our universe may ''be but one aeon in a (perhaps unending) succession of such aeons.'' What we think of as our ''universe'' may simply be one link in a chain of universes, each beginning with a big bang and ending in a way that sends detectable gravitational waves into the next universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument is highly controversial. But if the circles the two scientists have detected stand up to further examination -- if they're not the result of noise or instrumental error -- it could radically change the way we think about our universe. And the notion is no more radical than that of some cosmologists who argue that our universe is only one in a multiverse -- a possibly infinite number of co-existing, but undetectable, universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is: What do we do with these possibilities? Our answer is to marvel at them and be reminded, once again, that we live in a universe -- however we define it -- that contains more wonders than we can begin to imagine.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>725 words</div><div>2 December 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerned that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is dragging its feet in revamping its space program, a Senate panel sought assurances from Obama administration officials on Wednesday that NASA would carry out the orders it had been given for the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those orders, which President Obama signed into law in October, include scrapping a program to send astronauts to the moon in favor of a heavy-lift rocket for deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hearing, by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, was the latest tussle over the future of sending astronauts into space. Unlike most disagreements in Washington, which divide Republicans and Democrats, the NASA debate has largely been a schism between the White House and Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There have been plenty of messages that have been sent to the overseers, which is this committee, that certain elements of NASA and other parts of the administration intend to follow their own directions instead of the law,'' said Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who led the hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the panel's ranking Republican, said, ''If there are any concerns about that implementation, or if there are impediments to it, we want to know right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser, assured the panel that NASA had every intention of doing what it was supposed to. When Mr. Nelson asked, ''Do you intend to follow the law in the NASA authorization bill?'' Dr. Holdren replied, ''Absolutely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Elizabeth Robinson, NASA's chief financial officer, assured Ms. Hutchison that NASA was planning to fly an extra space shuttle mission that the authorization law calls for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration, in its budget request for the 2011 fiscal year, had sought to cancel NASA's entire program to send astronauts back to the moon. A compromise led by Senators Nelson and Hutchison kills the moon program, known as Constellation, but lets NASA continue working on a crew capsule for traveling beyond Earth orbit and start working on a new heavy-lift rocket that could one day fly deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skepticism from the senators seems mainly to center on plans for the heavy-lift rocket. The authorization law specifies the rocket's capabilities: it is to be ready by the end of 2016, be able to carry 70 tons to low-Earth orbit and evolve into a system that can lift 130 tons. The law also says the rocket should take advantage of pieces from the space shuttles and the canceled Constellation rockets ''to the extent practicable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is to present to Congress a plan for the heavy-lift rocket in January, and the senators' concern was that the agency was looking to delay development or for some way to use alternative rockets like the Delta IV now used by the Air Force to launch satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA awarded contracts totaling $7.5 million to 13 companies to provide input on the heavy-lift design. The companies included <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, which builds the solid rocket motors that help lift the space shuttle into orbit and which the NASA law foresees as part of the heavy-lift. But <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, which launches the Delta IV, also received a contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional members from Utah, where Alliant builds the solid rocket motors, have also expressed worries that NASA is looking for a way around the law. Two weeks ago, they met with Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, and Lori Garver, the deputy administrator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to have some assurance that NASA understood intent of the laws,'' said Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah. ''I don't think we were terribly satisfied.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bishop called the answers from General Bolden ''both vague and inconsistent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is limited in what it can do immediately. It has not been given a budget figure for the 2011 fiscal year, which started two months ago. And, although the authorization law signed in September requires the agency to cancel the Constellation program, there is a conflicting restriction that Congress put in last year's budget law that prevents NASA from canceling it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. Nelson said at the hearing, ''We want to see this law implemented without a lot of griping and moaning and groaning.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW I KILLED PLUTO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Why It Had It Coming</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mike Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">267 pages. Spiegel &amp; Grau. $25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caltech astronomy professor Mike Brown is not the first person to write about the rise of the planet Pluto (discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh) or its recent demotion (in 2006) to second-class citizenry in a newly reduced, eight-planet solar system. He may not even be the best, coming on the heels of Neil deGrasse Tyson's breezy ''Pluto Files,'' the novel ''Percival's Planet'' and at least one other nonfiction book on the cosmic Pluto flap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Brown has a unique distinction: He was, for a few hours in 2005, the only person on Planet Earth to know that the standard nine-planet solar system model was going to require rejiggering. He had just discovered a 10th potential planet, but he had also come to see that neither Pluto nor this new heavenly body (first nicknamed Xena, then officially named Eris) really measured up to the other eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't you think it would overall be better for astronomy to have new planets discovered than old planets killed?'' Dr. Brown is asked by his wife in ''How I Killed Pluto and Why it Had it Coming.'' His answer led to a lot of trouble. He replied that he though it would be best to get the facts right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is ample precedent for the kind of upheaval that Dr. Brown helped to create. He cites an 1837 textbook that described an 11-planet solar system and points out that by 1851 another 15 celestial bodies had been added to the list. So shake-ups and re-evaluations are hardly unprecedented in the world of astronomy. Still, Dr. Brown casts himself as something of a gunslinger, unusual billing in a tale of scientific research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's being facetious, as he often is in this short, eager-to-please research memoir. He has the kind of self-effacing, funny tone that must work well in a lecture hall. Thus he compares objects in the sky to fish in the ocean, with the asteroids as minnows, the major planets as whales and, within the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune where Pluto and other dwarf planets can be found, ''a previously overlooked collection of sardines swimming in a faraway sea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown's efforts to study this region could not have been conducted in earlier times. He relied on the huge telescopes and computer software that have so drastically altered the science of astronomy, advances that have caused scientists to face new technology-induced questions. Is it easiest to study a vast and highly magnified image of the sky? Or is there such a thing as photography so precise that it fills the heavens with (to use Dr. Brown's favorite type of metaphor) red herrings? How unwieldy is the huge amount of data that today's instruments can produce?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now that scientific information is stored in databases that can be accessed from anywhere in the world, what sort of ethics govern the use of that information? The most suspenseful part of ''How I Killed Pluto'' has to do with an unresolved dust-up between Dr. Brown and a Spanish group that jumped the gun to go public with the same information, a situation made even more ticklish by Dr. Brown's detection of hacking in his research database. ''Someone had come out of nowhere and kicked us in the gut,'' he writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conflicts over credit for astronomical discoveries have been around since the early 17th century, when Galileo used code and anagrams to protect his findings. But the speed with which discoveries can be made public has never been greater, and Dr. Brown found himself torn between the desire to be first and, as he saw it, the moral necessity of being right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually the pace would quicken when the whole Pluto question was taken up by the International Astronomical Association, an organization known for glacial pacing and rigorous rules. Dr. Brown and his team actually prepared four different news releases, anticipating the four possible outcomes of this group's deliberations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four options: Xena would be named a 10th planet; Pluto would get the boot, leaving only eight planets; nothing at all would change; or the word ''planet'' would suddenly be redefined. ''Why bother writing this one up?'' one of Dr. Brown's assistants asked about that fourth option. ''It sounds crazy. No one would decide this, would they?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would, and they did, creating a class of dwarf planets that included Pluto and also creating one very large Grinch: Dr. Brown himself. He grew up with the planet-memorizing mnemonic ''My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas.'' Now he's got a new one: ''Mean Very Evil Men Just Shortened Up Nature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the events in ''How I Killed Pluto'' were unfolding, Mr. Brown was also obsessed with a different kind of natural phenomenon. His slender, cheery book gets some padding in the form of his courtship, marriage, new fatherhood and (of course) blogging about his baby, Lilah. The presence of so many doting-father asides might get grating if Dr. Brown did not communicate his excitement and happiness so well and go about describing it in such wonky, scientific ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He used graph paper to chart the accuracy of babies' due dates. He kept meticulous data on baby feedings. And when he concluded without talking to his sister that she must be pregnant, she asked the kind of question that gives Dr. Brown's book its oddball edge. ''Are you studying astronomy or astrology?'' his sister wanted to know.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Without fanfare, without crowds of curious spectators, the future of the United States' space program sits on a launching pad here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket, a Falcon 9 built by <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short, is unassuming -- a runt compared to NASA's space shuttles. It is scheduled to lift off on Wednesday morning and place into orbit an empty capsule, designed to carry cargo and eventually astronauts, which will circle the Earth twice before splashing down in the Pacific. The mission is to last less than three and a half hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the flight lacks in theatrics, it marks a major shift in the space program toward private industry. It is the first demonstration flight under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration contract that is to lead to <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s ferrying supplies to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, under a new space exploration blueprint signed into law in October, will now embark on a similar strategy for sending astronauts to orbit -- buying rides from commercial companies rather than operating its own rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few details have been revealed about the so-called commercial crew program, but the earlier cargo program, started in 2006, demonstrates some of the promise of greater bang for the buck. During a news conference on Monday, Philip McAlister, acting director of commercial spaceflight development at NASA, pointed to the $253 million NASA paid <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> so far for development of the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule and to the four years that it took to reach the first demonstration flight -- cheaper and quicker than previous rocket programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both of those things are remarkable,'' Mr. McAlister said at the news conference, ''and an anomaly in terms of any historical development that I'm aware of, in terms of a traditional NASA development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that the commercial crew program, with NASA likely to invest several billion dollars over the next six years, will enlist companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to drive down the cost of space travel and allow NASA to devote its limited budget to more ambitious missions to send astronauts farther out into the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cargo program also offers reason for caution because companies do not always meet their lofty predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program ran into an almost immediate speed bump when one of the two companies NASA chose, Rocketplane Kistler, could not raise the money it needed. NASA canceled Kistler's contract the following year and had to run a second competition, which was won by the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span> of Dulles, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has been able to meet 17 of the 22 milestones in its contract, but took twice as long as it expected to do so. When it signed its contract in 2006, it predicted that it would get the first demonstration flight off in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the fixed-price contract, NASA did not pay extra, but <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had to seek additional financing from investors. Fixed-price contracts save taxpayers money if a company eventually completes its obligations, but waste time and money if the company fails like Kistler did. Orbital, which has received $155 million for meeting 15 of 21 milestones, is aiming for a demonstration flight late next year and beginning its cargo deliveries early in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has also already paid the two companies an additional $333 million under the cargo delivery contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have also begun hedging their bets, saying that one additional space shuttle flight is needed to carry up supplies before the shuttles are retired next year. The extra supplies would provide a buffer in case the schedules of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and Orbital slip. ''That gives us a little bit of margin there to make sure that station isn't in dire circumstances before the commercial providers come fully online,'' said William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the extra flight, the space station would start running short of supplies in 2012. Congress has authorized the extra flight, but NASA's budget for 2011 has not yet been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even success in the cargo program does not assure success in carrying astronauts. Launching people into orbit is more complex and expensive, and a worry is that NASA's exacting standards to make spaceflight as safe as possible would place expensive and onerous conditions on the companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas R. Cooke, associate administrator of NASA's exploration systems mission directorate, which is running the commercial crew and cargo development programs, said that a draft of the human rating standards required of the commercial companies the same 1-in-1,000 chance of a fatal accident during launching that NASA's Ares I rocket and Orion capsule sought to meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps more important, the path to making a profitable business out of sending a crew into space remains unclear. A commercial market has existed for decades for the launching of satellites; for example, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has already signed a $492 million contract with <span class="companylink">Iridium Communications Inc</span>. to launch Iridium's next-generation communication satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA's commercial crew needs might be as few as two flights a year, and no definite market beyond that yet exists for the flights, which will cost at least tens of millions of dollars per seat. John Elbon, vice president for commercial crew transportation at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which is also interested in bidding for the NASA business, said <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s analysis showed that the NASA business would probably be enough to be profitable. But it is the potential of the other markets, like space tourism or private space stations, that make it much more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Congress looking to rein in costs across the federal government, however, the commercial crew program might be squeezed even before it gets into full swing. President Obama had originally sought $6 billion over five years. Mr. Cooke said that NASA was looking at whether it could make do with half as much, $3 billion. ''We're looking at different options like that,'' he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, a commercial spacecraft gently returned to Earth from orbit on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight, by the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, went flawlessly from the launching of its Falcon 9 rocket, with a Dragon capsule riding on top, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to splashdown of the Dragon in the Pacific Ocean 3 hours, 19 minutes and 52 seconds later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was just 52 seconds later than <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a news conference afterward, Elon Musk, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s founder and chief executive, whose outsize confidence can verge on arrogance, was flustered as he talked about how everything worked as designed. ''It's actually almost too good,'' Mr. Musk said. ''We didn't have to go to backup systems at any point. I'm sort of in semishock.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission was the first demonstration for NASA of a spacecraft designed to ferry cargo and perhaps eventually astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has a contract worth $1.6 billion for 12 flights to take cargo and supplies to the space station. With the imminent cancellation of NASA's Ares I rocket that was to take astronauts there, the space agency will be hiring private companies to provide astronaut transportation as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of the flight ''reinforces what the president laid out and what Congress endorsed as the future of space transportation,'' Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said in an interview. ''This does indeed validate the path we are on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk asserted that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> was in a strong position to win at least part of the astronaut-carrying business. The Dragon already has a pressurized cabin and has been designed from the beginning with the intention of carrying people. ''If there were people sitting in the Dragon capsule today, they would have had a very nice ride,'' Mr. Musk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine and a half minutes after Wednesday's launching, the Dragon capsule detached from the second stage of the Falcon 9. The capsule circled the Earth twice at an altitude of 186 miles before re-entering the atmosphere. Slowed by parachutes, it splashed down about 500 miles west of northern Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The achievement impressed Joseph Fragola, an expert on spacecraft reliability who has not been sure that commercial launchings of astronauts could immediately meet the same safety targets that NASA's system -- the Ares I and its accompanying Orion crew capsule -- were aiming for. ''In my gut, I expected some anomalies at least, but as of now there appear to have been none,'' Mr. Fragola said of Wednesday's flight. ''That was a surprise, given the challenging nature of the flight plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the flight, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> announced that the Falcon 9 also carried to orbit eight tiny satellites, including one for the United States Army to test new communications technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second demonstration flight, going close to the space station but not docking, is set for next spring. A third and final demonstration flight under <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s $278 million development contract would dock at the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the success of the first flight, Mr. Musk said <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> hoped to combine the second and third flights into one.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the news conference, Mr. Musk regained some of his usual bravado, making a pitch that the Dragon could also be used for deep-space missions. In a revamped space program, work on the bigger and much more expensive Orion crew capsule will continue but is to ride on an as-yet-undesigned heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dragon has arguably more capability than Orion,'' Mr. Musk said. ''Basically, anything Orion can do, Dragon can do.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement that NASA experimenters had found a bacterium that seems to be able to subsist on arsenic in place of phosphorus -- an element until now deemed essential for life -- set off a cascading storm of criticism on the Internet, first about alleged errors and sloppiness in the paper published in Science by Felisa Wolfe-Simon and her colleagues, and then about their and NASA's refusal to address the criticisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a stormy brew of debate about the role of peer review, bloggers and the reliability of NASA, at least as it pertains to microbiological issues, almost as toxic as the salty and arsenic waters of Mono Lake in California, from which Dr. Wolfe-Simon of the U.S. Geological Survey scooped up some bacteria last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking evidence that life could follow a different biochemical path than what is normally assumed, Dr. Wolfe-Simon grew them in an arsenic-rich and phosphorus-free environment, reporting in the paper and a NASA news conference on Dec. 2 that the bacterium, strain GFAJ-1 of the Halomonadaceae family of Gammaproteobacteria, had substituted arsenic for phosphorus in many important molecules in its body, including DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the ink had hardly dried on headlines around the world when microbiologists, who have been suspicious of NASA ever since the agency announced that it had found fossils of microbes in a meteorite from Mars in 1996, began shooting back, saying the experimenters had failed to provide any solid evidence that arsenic had actually been incorporated into the bacterium's DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a scathing commentary on her blog RRResearch, Rosie Redfield, a microbiologist at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, ran through a long list of what she said were errors and omissions in the paper, which she summarized in the end as ''lots of flim-flam, but very little reliable information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other mistakes, she and others say, the experimenters failed to wash the bug's DNA before testing it for arsenic, thus leaving the possibility that the arsenic detected there was just stuck to the outside of the giant molecule, like mud on the bottom of a shoe, a process she described as ''Microbiology 101.'' Over the course of a week her blog, which normally has a few hundred visitors a day, recorded almost 90,000 hits before the furor died down. She has also sent a letter to Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things got nastier when NASA and Dr. Wolfe-Simon refused to respond to such criticisms, which quickly leapt from Dr. Redfield and others' blogs to Wired and Slate and The Observatory, a blog covering the science press for the Columbia Journalism Review. According to CBC News, Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman, said that the agency wouldn't debate science with bloggers and would stick to peer-reviewed literature. The online tech magazine Gizmodo ran a highly doctored picture of Dr. Redfield and Dr. Wolfe-Simon staring lightning bolts at each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement on her own Web site, Dr. Wolfe-Simon noted that the paper had been carefully peer-reviewed and said, ''We've been concerned that some conclusions have been drawn based on claims not made in our paper,'' but did not elaborate on what those mistaken claims were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the interest of stimulating healthy debate, she said, Science was making the paper available free of charge (although registration is required) for a couple of weeks. The experimenters are compiling a list of answers for frequently asked questions, which can be sent to gfajquestions@gmail.com and will eventually be posted online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Redfield said Mr. Brown's reaction was silly. ''We are the peers,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversation and arguing have always been an important part of how science has been done, she said. Once upon a time it was by mail, and was private and slow. ''Now,'' she said, ''the conversation is carried out in public in ways everyone can see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''This kind of intellectual analysis and give and take is a big chunk of the fun of doing science.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, she said she sympathized with Dr. Wolfe-Simon's position as a woman in science advocating a controversial view, and she agreed with her decision to keep a low peer-reviewed profile. More arguing, as a blogger who goes by the name of Isis pointed out in a post titled ''Don't Like Arsenic Bacteria? Put Your Experiment Where Your Mouth Is!,'' will not solve the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only more data, which will probably be forthcoming, will tell whether the GFAJ-1 bug is weird life that has found a new way to live, or just tough and able to survive in arsenic. If the original paper was right, that would be ''great,'' said Dr. Redfield. But the opposite could also be presented as a demonstration that life is such a powerful force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''NASA can spin it either way,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated, 1:18 a.m. | Monday night and into the morning, the earth will prevent the sun's rays from reaching the moon, in what is known as a lunar eclipse. But one like this will not happen again until 2094.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the&nbsp;first time in 372 years,&nbsp;a lunar eclipse also coincides with the winter solstice,&nbsp;the time at which the sun is at its southernmost point in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it is scheduled to happen over the course of about 72 minutes, starting at 1:33 Eastern time on Tuesday morning. But the moment to dash out of the house and into the cold is 3:16:57 a.m. Eastern time, when the moon will be a reddish copper color in the earth's shadow. It is supposed to be a particularly good show for people in North America (if they are under clear skies) and a rare way to usher in a new season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not letting this spectacle escape its gaze, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has set up several ways for skywatchers to convene on its Web site. Viewers can post pictures on Flickr, or watch&nbsp;a live video feed from a camera mounted at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is also&nbsp;hosting an "Up All Night" question-and-answer&nbsp; feature with the astronomer Mitzi Adams, who will be online from midnight to 5 a.m.,&nbsp;Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site includes some advanced reading materials on eclipses of this year that speak in dynamical time, or how time is tracked in the solar system, as well as other explanatory materials for novices, like this timeline of the eclipse tracked in Universal Time. For New Yorkers and others on Eastern time, subtract five hours, which we've done for you here:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penumbral eclipse begins: 12:29:17 E.S.T.Partial eclipse begins: 1:32:37 E.S.T.Total eclipse begins: 2:40:47 E.S.T.Greatest eclipse: 3:16:57 E.S.T.Total eclipse ends: 3:53:08 E.S.T.Partial eclipse ends: 5:01:20 E.S.T.Penumbral eclipse ends: 6:04:31 E.S.T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth's Sky feature will also allow viewers to stay inside and keep warm this frigid night with a live feed from the robotic telescope service Slooh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or allow them to watch gigantic projections of the moon in transition on huge screens in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even where it is pouring, or the sky is covered with a thick blanket of clouds, all who want to can watch if they stay up late enough.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUITLAND, Md. -- Stashed in a Smithsonian storage building in this Washington suburb are some of the engineering wonders of the space race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These marvels are far smaller than the towering rockets and streamlined spacecraft that took men into orbit and to the Moon. Far softer, too. They are the spacesuits that kept the astronauts alive beyond Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the National Air and Space Museum's collection of about 300 spacesuits is here, laid out five high on steel racks in a climate-controlled room. Each is protected by a sheet of muslin, giving the room the eerie feel of a morgue or the final resting place of members of an odd space cult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are Mercury suits like the one worn by Scott Carpenter, the fourth American in space, its iconic reflective coating coming off in spots. There's the Apollo 11 suit worn by Neil A. Armstrong, looking about as pristine as when he made his first small step on the moon in 1969, thanks to a cleaning job by NASA that, in retrospect, was ill advised because it damaged the materials the suit was made of. Nearby lies Harrison H. Schmitt's Apollo 17 outfit, still heavily coated in lunar grit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many suits that never made it into space, projects like the EX1-A, which had doughnut-shaped joints that allowed the wearer full limb movement; the AX-5, which looks like a space-age version of the Michelin Man; and the AES, which was covered almost entirely in fabric of woven stainless steel. (It looks fabulous and was fabulously expensive.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are accessories, too: lunar booties with the same stainless-steel fabric on top; Manned Orbiting Laboratory gloves with sharkskin palms and sewn-in steel fingernails, so nimble that an astronaut could pick up a dime while wearing them, even when they were pressurized; long johns laced with plastic pipes, to water-cool the wearer; and box after box of headgear, including Mr. Armstrong's gold-visored external helmet, once thought to have been left on the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacesuits will get their due next spring, in a traveling exhibition of full-size photographs and X-ray images organized by the Smithsonian. (Most of the suits -- especially their rubber components, which have become brittle over the decades -- are too fragile to be displayed.) Last month, a few of the people who know most about spacesuits gathered at the museum for a panel discussion about the design decisions and trade-offs that went into creating these most personal of space-race artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of it is engineering,'' Joseph J. Kosmo, a senior project engineer with NASA who has designed spacesuits for nearly 50 years, said in an interview. ''But a lot of it is art, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its most basic, a spacesuit is meant to perform two nearly incompatible functions: protect the astronaut from the harsh environment of space, and allow the wearer to maneuver and work comfortably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The emphasis is on trying to develop a very mobile system while pressurized,'' said Mr. Kosmo, who in 1961, fresh out of college with a degree in an aeronautical engineering, was asked if he'd be interested in a job described as working on ''spacesuits, whatever they are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pressure suit -- a rubber bladder and a sealed helmet -- allows the astronaut to survive in the vacuum of space. But a bladder is constricting when unpressurized, and when it is inflated movement becomes even more difficult, because moving the joints reduces the volume, increasing the pressure inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you pressurize it, it's like working inside of a sausage,'' said Joseph P. Kerwin, an astronaut aboard the Skylab mission in 1973 and the Apollo program ''suit guy'' -- the astronaut who worked most closely with spacesuit engineers -- for several years before that. ''The whole trick in designing a spacesuit was to make it easier to move the joints inside that inflated balloon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So engineers, including Mr. Kosmo, spent years using their knowledge of anatomy, movement and materials to develop better joints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doughnut-shaped ones on the EX1-A were a solution -- they are hard joints, so the volume of the suit remains constant when movement occurs, and there is no pressure increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more practical solution, however, turned out to be something called a convolute -- accordionlike folds in the bladder at the shoulders, knees and other joints. With a system of cables to keep the folds from stretching, convolutes provided a good degree of movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first suits, for the solo Mercury flights from 1961 to 1963, were variations on military high-altitude flight suits and were simpler, said Amanda Young, who spent 15 years organizing the museum's suit collection before retiring in 2009. (Aside from a few later prototypes, the collection ends with post-Apollo projects like Skylab; shuttle and space station suits are not yet included.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mercury suits had only two layers -- the pressure bladder and a nylon covering to protect the bladder and help it keep its rough shape when pressurized. (The thin aluminized coating, glued to the nylon, may have been more for show than for thermal protection.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Mercury suits, the bladder was there only for emergencies, like loss of capsule pressure, to enable the astronaut to survive until he could return to Earth. ''All it was was 'get me down' capability,'' Mr. Kosmo said. No such emergency ever occurred, so the suits were never pressurized in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Mercury astronaut was crammed in his capsule, mobility was not an issue. ''You didn't have to go reaching around, you didn't have to get out and walk around,'' Mr. Kosmo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the first spacewalks, in the two-astronaut Gemini flights in the mid-1960s, that changed, said Ms. Young, the author of ''Spacesuits,'' a book about the museum's collection. ''The suits had a totally different construction,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides requiring that the suits be pressurized, going outside the spacecraft exposed the astronaut to micrometeoroids -- high-speed particles that could puncture a spacesuit -- and to extremes of heat and cold. So more layers, of Dacron, Mylar and other polymer materials, were added to protect and insulate the astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other common-sense changes were made, too, Ms. Young said. ''They learned that you had to put a flap over the zipper in the back, because if you turned your back to the sun the zipper would heat up,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when astronauts tried to do work, they quickly overheated. Air-cooling was inadequate, Mr. Kosmo said, and the idea of water-cooled underwear was developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long johns were a big success during the Apollo program, Mr. Kerwin said, describing a conversation he had with Alan Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon. Mr. Bean was cavorting about and began to overheat, so he turned the knob on his coolant backpack from low to medium. The result, he told Mr. Kerwin, was ''like diving into a swimming pool -- you felt that cold on your body right away.'' No one ever tried the high setting, Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its moon walks, the Apollo program placed other demands on suit designers. ''It turned out that walking on the moon and protecting the crew inside the command module added up to a lot of sometimes not very compatible requirements,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit had to be comfortable enough to wear for hours in the confines of the command module, the capsule that took the astronauts to the moon and back, and not so bulky that the men could not work all the switches and levers on the spacecraft's console while strapped into their seats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But walking on the moon required extra protection from heat and cold and micrometeoroids, and there was always the risk of falling and ripping something. So the Apollo suit had to be bulky, with about 20 layers, including an outer one of Beta cloth, which is woven from Teflon-wrapped glass fibers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compromises were made, Mr. Kerwin said. He described one incident involving the crew of the first manned Apollo flight in 1968, commanded by one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, Walter M. Schirra. As part of a test, the astronauts were strapped into the command module in fully pressurized suits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wally went nuts,'' Mr. Kerwin recalled. ''When they pressurized the suits, his right elbow overlapped the left elbow of the command module pilot, Donn Eisele, who was sitting in the center seat.'' Mr. Schirra complained loudly that he could not properly operate the spacecraft's controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And he was one of the original seven -- what Wally says goes,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mr. Schirra's insistence, the engineers restricted the shoulder joints in all the suits so that the arms would not overlap. ''But what he was doing was destroying in one blow all the careful mobility they'd put into those arms for the lunar surface job,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schirra's flight did not go to the Moon, so the extra mobility was not needed. For subsequent lunar flights, the engineers went back to the more mobile design, but for only two of each mission's three astronauts -- the two who would walk on the moon. ''The command module pilot never lands on the moon, so his suit can have the restricted shoulders,'' Mr. Kerwin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a perfect example of when you have conflicting requirements, try not to destroy the most important one in order to fulfill a less important one,'' he continued. The engineers ''worked that kind of thing all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They got it right,'' he said. ''I have to say, they got it right.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hanny van Arkel had been using the Galaxy Zoo Web site less than a week when she noticed something odd about the photograph of IC 2497, a minor galaxy in the Leo Minor constellation. ''It was this strange thing,'' she recalled: an enormous gas cloud, floating like a ghost in front of the spiral galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dutch schoolteacher with no formal training in astronomy, Ms. van Arkel had joined tens of thousands of other Web volunteers to help classify photographs taken by deep-space telescopes. Stumped by the unusual image on her computer screen, she e-mailed the project staff for guidance. Staff members were stumped, too. And thus was christened the celestial body now known to astronomers worldwide as Hanny's Voorwerp (Dutch for ''object'').</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories like Ms. van Arkel's are becoming more common, as the Internet opens up new opportunities for so-called citizen scientists. And as millions of people get involved in these participatory projects, scientists are grappling with how best to harness the amateurs' enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics argue that citizen science projects are often little more than ploys to stimulate public interest rather than advance scientific knowledge. Others fret over the quality of data generated by nonspecialists. But scientists must weigh such risks against the benefits of a powerful new research tool: a vast computer network that can parcel out complex projects into small tasks that can be completed by individuals with relatively limited training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many got their first taste of citizen science with SETI@Home, which enlisted more than five million users in the search for signs of extraterrestrial life. Volunteers downloaded a program that used their computers' idle processing cycles to sift through data from radio telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of SETI@Home has inspired a number of other grid-computing initiatives, like Grid Republic, a consortium of more than 50 projects relying on the same screensaver-based software, and IBM's World Community Grid, which is being used by Chinese researchers to investigate efficient water-filtering techniques using nanotubes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now researchers are starting to look for ways to engage contributors in more substantive ways, taking advantage of what the Internet pundit Clay Shirky calls the ''cognitive surplus'' of online brainpower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Galaxy Zoo, the Herbaria@home project turns users into volunteer taxonomists, classifying images from collections of herbarium specimens across Britain. To date, the site's 284 registered users have cataloged more than 75,000 specimens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other citizen science projects enlist users as data gatherers, inviting them to contribute field observations about meteorological data, wildlife behavior and other phenomena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cornell University's Nestwatch provides a platform for amateur ornithologists to share observations about the nesting habits of bird species across North America. Recently, organizers have focused on tracking the effects of the BPoil spill on local birds' nesting patterns. And Australia's ClimateWatch project invites users to track seasonal variations in plant and animal life cycles across the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the open-door participation policies, project administrators face major challenges in ensuring the integrity of their data. Staff members at Herbaria@home perform manual quality checks on about 5 percent of the incoming data, while ClimateWatch uses an algorithm to look for unusual data points, which can then be manually checked for accuracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quality control aside, a larger question remains: Does the act of data gathering really constitute science?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These people are not doing the work of scientists,'' said David Weinberger, a senior researcher at the Berkman Center for the Internet and Society at Harvard, who is writing a book about the changing shape of human knowledge in the online era. ''They are doing the work of scientific instruments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Emmott, head of computational research at Microsoft Research, agrees that most citizen science projects tend to treat participants as high-functioning cogs in a distributed machine. ''Certainly this is participatory,'' he said, ''but is it science?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Emmott believes that before Web users can claim the mantle of citizen scientists, they will have to be given more meaningful roles. ''Participants should be able to make a genuine contribution,'' he said, ''and get something back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Emmott's team is exploring new models that would involve users in the research process without compromising academic rigor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other researchers are looking to tap the higher brain functions of Web users. Foldit turns protein research into a game, offering Web users a puzzle in the form of a multicolored knot of spirals and clumps. Each puzzle represents a sequence of amino acids, which the user tries to fold into the most efficient shape possible. By combining computational algorithms with the visual problem-solving skills of more than 100,000 Web users, the researchers hope to pioneer a new approach to solving computational problems using supplemental human brain power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some researchers are focused on expanding the contributions of average Web users, others want to cultivate people who already have some level of scientific training.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">InnoCentive offers an online marketplace where organizations can pose problems to a network of more than 200,000 ''solvers'' who compete for cash rewards for the best solution. Recent InnoCentive contests include a $1 million prize for a biomarker to measure the progression of Lou Gehrig's disease, as well as a $7,500 prize for better-smelling cat litter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other citizen science projects are taking shape at the grassroots level. DIYBio is a two-year-old organization with more than 1,500 members interested in conducting their own collaborative science projects. The organization has now spawned three physical lab spaces in Boston, Brooklyn and San Francisco , where members can participate in projects with polymerase chain reaction tests, centrifuges and DNA sequencing equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying to get people more involved in hands-on science,'' said Jason Bobe, a founder of DIYBio. Members are exploring opportunities to turn genome sequencing into a game in which participants pull in data from crosswalk buttons and the like to model the spread of micro-organisms in urban environments. In a recent experiment, members collected dollar bills from 50 volunteers, then extracted the DNA for sequencing to identify all the micro-organisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new self-organizing research communities emerge online, the long-term impact of citizen science projects may have less to do with the citizens than with the scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Web users can review research in progress and engage scientists in open discussions, the traditional process of peer review based on the model of academic publishing will face some new challenges. ''It opens up another layer of participation,'' Dr. Weinberger said, ''and that's where the deep impact is felt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, out on the open Web, hundreds of thousands of nonscientists continue to look for opportunities to take part in scientific research, inspired by the example of people like Ms. van Arkel, who has been enjoying the perks of Internet microstardom. She now blogs, maintains a Twitter feed and speaks at conferences and recently took a star turn in her own community-generated comic book.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON Friday a time machine will land on the stage of the Abrons Arts Center. The crew -- an astronaut, a squishy space alien and a cyborg with a mustache -- will try to transport audience members to the future, saving them from ''an event so potent it turned this entire planet into a grave.'' Unfortunately this future features endless copulation and meals salvaged from one's own bodily waste. To get there, spectators will first have to survive goofy costumes, low-tech special effects, alien mucus sacs and at least one appalling dance number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Annihilation Point,'' a spoofy piece of lo-fi sci-fi from the Berserker Residents, a Philadelphia company committed to producing fantastical shows, is the latest example in the current surge of science fiction in the theater. Though playwrights as varied as Karel Capek, George Bernard Shaw, Sam Shepard and Caryl Churchill have composed plays in the genre, these scripts are staged rarely, and new ones usually arrive just as infrequently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the last 12 months New York audiences have enjoyed Jay Scheib's ''Bellona, Destroyer of Cities,'' a version of Samuel R. Delany's punk dystopia ''Dhalgren,'' the Mad Ones' ''Samuel and Alasdair: A Personal History of the Robot War,'' Wakka Wakka's ''Baby Universe: A Puppet Odyssey,'' and new adaptations of Ed Wood's film ''Plan 9 From Outer Space'' and Philip K. Dick's novel ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And perhaps you've heard of a little show derived from some Spider-Man comics?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The novelist Isaac Asimov once defined science fiction as art contending with ''something that is not yet so.'' And while drama is the original virtual reality, an everyday exemplar of an alternative universe, sci-fi stories have made their way onto the stage far less often than into books or movies. Even though the surrealists and absurdists and symbolists have long since shown us that anything is possible onstage, most playwrights and directors prefer to hew to the laws of time, gravity and thermodynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheib, an associate professor of theater arts at M.I.T. whose stage work limns space travel and parallel worlds, wonders if theater's classical origins have inhibited such exploration. ''When you have a really hard-core tradition of unities of time and place and action, it's hard to imagine slippages of time, for instance,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others cite the constraints of the playing area and the budget. ''There's a limit to what you can do,'' said Tim Sawicki, the author of ''The Annihilation Point.'' The stage, he said, ''can't deliver a lot of science-fiction staples -- space, crazy robotics, mutant superpowers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Rothenberg, the show's director, added: ''Theater is so fundamentally low-tech. Most theater is made out of wood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore Frank Cwiklik, who directed the stage version of the Ed Wood film, said that ''some artistic directors are resistant to anything that could be seen as gimmicky or lowbrow, and lump science fiction in with that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these challenges, science fiction plays -- some defiantly silly, some yearningly serious -- are appearing more often. Lejla Kucukalic, a Columbia University professor who lectures on science fiction, hypothesized that ''the increased presence of technology, media and science in our daily lives'' may help to explain this uptick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Science fiction, no matter what form it takes, allows the artist to explore alternative forms of world and character building, often for the purpose of social critique and as often to entertain and dazzle,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Way back in 1921 Capek, a Czech playwright, introduced the word ''robot'' to the language in his drama ''R.U.R.,'' and playwrights since -- especially those with a debt to Mr. Dick and Mr. Delany -- have explored contemporary issues of identity, community and the relationship between humans and machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A play set in an alternate universe ''gives you great freedom to think about where you are now without the pressure of having to be so literal,'' Mr. Scheib said. Or, as with ''The Annihilation Point,'' it's merely a great excuse for some wonderfully inane Buck Rogers flashbacks -- camp for straight guys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annie Dorsen, a director whose ''Hello Hi There,'' a piece in which two computers converse with each other, opens at Performance Space 122 on Thursday, said that contemporary theater makers ought to engage directly with the technological revolution. ''We as artists should be jumping in with both feet,'' she said, ''sometimes brilliantly, sometimes stupidly, sometimes overenthusiastically -- responding to it and not retreating from it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once artists decide to explore science fiction, challenges await them. Many practitioners spoke of feeling compelled to ramp up their visual capabilities (set, lighting, costumes, effects) before embarking on a science fiction play, and of encountering a disparity between their desires and their abilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gwendolyn Warnock, one of the creators of ''Baby Universe,'' a poignant puppet play inspired by Stephen Hawking's theoretical physics, said the new piece required the company to extend itself technically. ''We incorporated projection for the first time, so that we could leap off to the clouds or into the stars, and we used a lot of small practical lights so that we could create the space station,'' she explained. ''And then we used pyrotechnics because we needed our own Big Bang.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Curnutte, one of the Mad Ones, a company with the tag line ''Up with robots, down with people,'' said that he and his colleagues would joke wistfully about how they'd stage their play with unlimited finances: ''We'd say, 'Oh, this is the moment where a robot hand comes crashing through the ceiling of the Winter Garden,' but obviously we weren't really going to do that at a 50-seat house in Williamsburg. So you had to just hear that robot through the walls.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many companies, like the Berserker Residents, take a more playful approach to the genre and celebrate a deliberately low-budget aesthetic. ''Our particular brand of sci-fi is very comic, goofy, irreverent, slapdash,'' Mr. Sawicki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That the effects are done with glue and string and cardboard is part of the fun,'' Mr. Rothenberg added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on the cheap, plays that want to take audiences to other times and places -- especially, say, if they require costumes based on candy-colored holograms, as Mr. Scheib's ''Bellona'' does -- are always going to be harder to realize than your standard living-room drama. In New York many have been conceived by gonzo theater groups rather than single playwrights, and they often arrive in offbeat spaces. But their creators argue that they allow for important thematic possibilities -- or at least the opportunity to don some nifty space boots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if, as in ''The Annihilation Point,'' a piece of sci-fi onstage also promises to save an entire audience from cosmic extinction, well -- everyone into the time machine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW I KILLED PLUTO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Why It Had It Coming</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mike Brown</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">267 pp. Spiegel &amp; Grau. $25</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union voted to ax Pluto from our solar system's pantheon of planets, rechristening it a ''dwarf planet.'' The ballot took place because Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, had detected a potential 10th planet, and the union had to decide how to categorize it. Admit the object to the roster and you pave the way for a solar system with over 100 planets. (Astronomers expect the Kuiper belt, the region beyond Neptune where the potential planet was found, to contain many similar objects.) Exclude it and you must also banish Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I expected this vote, which took place in Prague, to be the most memorable section of Brown's ''How I Killed Pluto.'' Or else the moment when after sifting through thousands of telescopic images, he first discerned the moving object -- ''planet'' means ''wanderer'' -- that triggered the I.A.U.'s vote. Oddly, though, what stuck with me was the scene in which Brown groggily dumped cat litter instead of detergent into his washing machine, exhausted not from nights peering through high-powered telescopes at Palomar Mountain or Mauna Kea but from waking up to feed his newborn daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How I Killed Pluto'' is a strange artifact, an unlikely hybrid of Dennis Overbye's ''Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos'' and Anne Lamott's ''Operating Instructions.'' It's not a book about the former ninth planet -- or even planetary astronomy -- lightly salted with Brown's family life. A good bit of it chronicles infant development, even including some of Brown's blog posts about his daughter's eating and sleeping habits during the first 240 days after her birth. ''If you examine all non-bottle feeds between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m.,'' one entry informs us, ''the average interval between feeds is 2 hours 39 minutes. If you examine the same bottle feeds you find an average of 2 hours 28 minutes between feeds. Hmmm. Eleven whole minutes. . . . Me and a bottle are almost as good as the real thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach has a strength: Brown opens the emotional life of an actual scientist to the reader, belying the myth that he and his colleagues are automatons. But it also has a weakness: readers swept along by the thrill of a gigantic story -- the discovery of a potential new planet -- can be stopped by irrelevancies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown is most successful when he's describing his work as an astronomer, revealing the way planning and luck combined in his discovery of at least three big objects orbiting our sun. One Thanksgiving in the late 1990s, prevented by fog from using the 200-inch Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory, he decided to check out the 48-inch Schmidt telescope instead. Because this telescope used analog technology, Brown viewed it as a ''fossil.'' But then he realized: old-fashioned photography beats digital imaging at capturing large sweeps of the sky, making it ideal for mapping big areas where a new planet was likely to lurk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the technology was daunting. ''The last time I had touched real film,'' he writes, ''was when I was in third grade and my father and I had built a little darkroom.'' Worse, the Schmidt photographic plates were so sensitive to red light that they could be developed only in total darkness. Happily, though, on that fateful night he met a Schmidt veteran, an expert in the ancient technology who was thrilled when Brown suggested using the telescope to map a new part of the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Planet hunting is not for the lazy or the easily distracted. After his team made thousands of images, Brown had to write software to detect objects that moved, then correct for photographic distortions and imperfections. When he tells of finding, against great odds, a bright object that ''might well be a planet,'' the reader shares his excitement as well as his proprietary feelings. And when a Spanish astronomer, tipped off by online observatory records, claims credit for the discovery, the reader also shares his indignation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quest for new planets is inevitably also a quest for fame. But as the I.A.U. considered adding Brown's potential 10th planet to the list, he made it clear that science must trump celebrity: ''The idea that astronomers would actively encourage people to have the wrong view of the solar system seemed almost criminal. The idea that I was going to, overnight, become one of the most famous astronomers in the world on account of this criminal activity made me a passive accomplice. I had to do something to stop it.'' Voting was not an option: Brown had never joined the I.A.U. (''I can't get myself to fill out the paperwork,'' he explains.) So from his mother-in-law's house in the Pacific Northwest, he rang Caltech's press office and began a successful campaign to demote Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps because Brown has a daughter, ''Why I Killed Pluto'' addresses gender discrimination in the sciences. In the early 20th century, when the Palomar Mountain observatories were built, they included sleeping quarters called the Monastery that, like the telescopes themselves, were off limits to women. Decades later, space science was no more integrated, particularly at NASA's Marshall space center, where Brown's father worked on Project Apollo. Growing up, Brown recalls, ''you became a rocket engineer if you were a boy and you married a rocket engineer if you were a girl.'' ''Even today,'' he observes at the scene of a Caltech dinner party, ''things remain frighteningly skewed.'' Nearly all the men at the table are scientists; nearly all their wives are not. But he has hope: ''Most of my graduate students in recent years have been female. Times have no choice but to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I admire Brown's concern with gender equity, but when I read his descriptions of baby care, I couldn't help wondering: Would a woman astronomer be taken seriously if so much of her book on planet-hunting also detailed her infant's first months?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens to a dark energy dream deferred?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ambitious $1.6 billion spacecraft that would investigate the mysterious force that is apparently accelerating the expansion of the universe -- and search out planets around other stars, to boot -- might have to be postponed for a decade, NASA says, because of cost overruns and mismanagement on a separate project, the James Webb Space Telescope. The news has dismayed many American astronomers, who worry they will wind up playing second fiddle to their European counterparts in what they say is the deepest mystery in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many things can we do in our lifetime that will excite a generation of scientists?'' asked Saul Perlmutter, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is one of dark energy's discoverers. There is a sense, he said, ''that we're starting to give up leadership in these important areas in fundamental physics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, after 10 years of debate and interagency wrangling, a prestigious committee from the National Academy of Sciences gave highest priority among big space projects in the coming decade to a satellite telescope that would take precise measure of dark energy, as it is known, and also look for planets beyond our solar system. The proposed project goes by the slightly unwieldy acronym Wfirst, for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Academy's report was ambushed by NASA's announcement in November that the successor to the Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope, which had been scheduled for a 2014 launching, would require at least another $1.6 billion and several more years to finish, pushing the next big mission to 2022 at the very earliest. The Webb will search out the first stars and galaxies to have formed in the universe, but is not designed for dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To take up the slack until 2025 -- or whenever the American mission can finally fly -- the space agency has proposed buying a 20 percent share in a European dark-energy mission known as Euclid that could fly as soon as 2018. In return, NASA would ask for a similar investment by Europe in Wfirst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, said Dr. Perlmutter, ''most of us think it is hard to imagine if we do Euclid now that we will do a dark-energy mission then.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who heads a committee that advises NASA on astrophysics, said: ''If Euclid goes ahead, they're going to own the field. There's no way the U.S. can stop them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the American astronomers' worries about falling behind seemed to be validated by a second Academy panel convened to consider the Euclid option. The panelists pointed out that part of the reason that Wfirst had been given such high priority was that it could be launched sooner rather than later. The panel urged NASA to stay the course or to explore merging Wfirst and Euclid in a joint operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everybody agrees that nothing is cast in stone yet. Euclid must survive a bake-off with two other projects before it is approved by the European Space Agency, or E.S.A. Not until then, European astronomers say, will they be able to talk about changes to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not said how it plans to get the $1.6 billion it needs to finish the Webb telescope, and thus how much will be left for other projects this decade. Some of the answers will be in the 2012 NASA budget due next month. ''Fitting the E.S.A. and NASA processes together at this stage would be a challenge, but the scientific benefits are clear,'' according to the new report by the Academy, which was delivered in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, director of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, said in an interview that NASA was committed to carrying out the recommendations of the original Academy survey that endorsed Wfirst. It is the ''sense of Congress,'' he said, that the Academy ''should guide NASA science programs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about worries that Euclid could give the Europeans a big leg up in dark-energy work, Dr. Morse said, ''The Europeans have developed a significant capability for doing their own missions.'' ''The scientific return for their investment has been outstanding,'' Dr. Morse said, adding that European astronomers are looking for ''frontier scientific discoveries'' to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark energy certainly counts as frontier science. The discovery a decade ago that the universe is speeding up, in defiance of common sense or cosmic gravity, has thrown into doubt notions about the fate of the universe and of life within it, not to mention gravity and even the nature of the laws of physics. It is as if, when you dropped your car keys, they shot up to the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists have one ready-made explanation for this behavior, but it is a cure that many of them think is worse than the disease: a fudge factor invented by Einstein in 1917 called the cosmological constant. He suggested, and quantum theory has subsequently confirmed, that empty space could exert a repulsive force, blowing things apart. But the best calculations predict an effect 10 to the exponent of 120 times greater than what astronomers have measured, causing physicists to metaphorically tear their hair out and mutter about multiple universes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers who made this discovery were using the exploding stars known as Type 1a supernovae as cosmic distance markers to track the expansion rate of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, other tools have emerged by which astronomers can also gauge dark energy by how it retards the growth of galaxies and other structures in the universe. So far the observations are consistent with it being Einstein's constant, but not definitive; more precise measurements, many of which can only be done from space, are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perlmutter, who works in the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, proposed a dark energy mission known as SNAP (Supernova Acceleration Probe) in 1999. In 2003, the White House asked the Energy Department to partner with NASA on the project, which became known as JDEM, for Joint Dark Energy Mission, and a call went out for competing proposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA and the Energy Department found it hard to collaborate, and several rounds of meetings and committees went nowhere. ''Maybe we shouldn't have tried to ride two horses,'' Dr. Perlmutter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, NASA and the Energy Department budgeted $600 million, not including launching costs, for a mission, but a working group of dark-energy scientists could not come up with a design that would fit in the budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling that the blessing of the National Academy of Sciences was needed to proceed with a more expensive project, Dr. Morse submitted a couple of versions of the dark energy mission to the Academy panel -- also known as Astro2010 -- that was charged with setting priorities for the astronomical community for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories, who led one of the panel's subcommittees, noticed that three of the submitted projects -- including dark energy, a search for planets around other stars, dubbed exoplanets, and a survey of infrared radiation from the heavens -- all required the same hardware. He proposed combining them into a larger mission (''putting more eggs into the basket,'' in Dr. Perlmutter's words), in a project that could launch around 2020. That larger mission they dubbed Wfirst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looked then and it still looks to me like a good deal,'' said Roger Blandford of Stanford, an astrophysicist and the chairman of the Astro2010 panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the European Space Agency had also made dark energy a priority. Last February, the Europeans sent NASA a letter offering the Americans a 20 percent piece of Euclid and two slots on the mission's science team. American astronomers were ambivalent. Joining Euclid would divert resources from their own mission, thus delaying it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September NASA's advisory committee on astrophysics, which is led by Dr. Boss of the Carnegie Institution, concluded that Euclid could spend three or four years ''skimming the cream off the dark energy pail'' before Wfirst got into the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Dr. Boss's council and yet another committee, the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee, which counsels the National Science Foundation and Energy Department as well as NASA, concluded that joining Euclid was not in keeping with the original Academy recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the second Academy panel reported in December, the news about the Webb telescope's problems had made everything worse. The Webb, which was the highest Academy priority 10 years ago and has already cost $5 billion, could not be launched any earlier than 2015 and would probably be even later, because of NASA's inability to correctly estimate how long it would take to do things like test the telescope. How much of the $2.2 billion that NASA was to have available for new astrophysics missions this decade will be left once Webb is taken care of is anybody's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, NASA faces what Dr. Morse calls ''an evolved difficult fiscal environment,'' with Republicans bent on reducing the federal budget taking over the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some astronomers said they felt ambushed by NASA and Dr. Morse, who briefed the Astro2010 panel during its two years of deliberations. ''He didn't know? He should be fired,'' said Dr. Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morse said he understood and shared his colleagues' frustration. But said he had warned the panel all along that its plans could be upset by the Webb, which has always been known to have problems. ''The community,'' he said, referring to the Astro2010 panel, ''did the best job they could with what they were given. The fiscal constraints are far worse now than we could imagine a year ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, as Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and a member of Astro2010, put it, ''We're in a terrible mess.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, NASA solicited proposals from astronomers who want to join Euclid and named a team that will begin meeting in February to begin planning Wfirst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem with Euclid from the Academy point of view is that it does not include observations of supernovae, the technique by which dark energy was discovered. Nor does the United States play a leadership role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss, however, speaking personally, said he worried that those recommendations were out of date with new realities -- budget and otherwise -- and that following them could keep the United States out of what might be the only dark-energy mission for some time. ''It's time for some creative thought,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The European Union is producing more papers per year than the U.S.,'' Dr. Boss went on. ''They passed us a year ago and are doing quite well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Blandford, the chairman of the original Academy panel, agreed. ''Dark energy and exoplanets are both fields of tremendous scientific importance and have caught the public's attention,'' he said. ''In both cases, the U.S. is currently the leading contributor. To abdicate that investment and opportunity would seem a terrible shame, but it doesn't mean we have to see Europeans as enemies we have to vanquish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perlmutter, one of the discoverers of dark energy, sounded a similar note. ''What's sad here is that everybody's been trying hard, there are no villains,'' he said. ''We all feel it is important to be at the table. At the end of the day we're scientists, you want to see science done.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When astronomers like Chris Lintott of the Adler Planetarium look for changes in the galaxies, they study images of outer space to detect minute differences between one photo and the next. Computers are of only limited use in this work, so the planetarium is enlisting thousands of volunteers with little scientific training to help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Adler has become a leader in ''citizen science,'' a growing trend in astronomy research. As the lead institution of the Citizen Science Alliance, which includes Oxford and Johns Hopkins Universities, it has registered more than 350,000 non-experts to help classify the many thousands of pictures of galaxies taken by powerful telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The images can help researchers better identify the shapes of galaxies, observe the formation of stars and follow the movement of asteroids. Astronomers often use computers to help analyze photos of outer space, but computers can miss anomalies and patterns that the human eye is particularly equipped to catch, said Joshua Frieman, a researcher at FermiLab and a professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't need a lot of detailed astronomical training to be able to look at these images and answer certain basic questions about them,'' Professor Frieman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, astronomers had assumed red galaxies were elliptical, but volunteers recently identified many of them as spirals. The amateurs' observations have also helped scientists predict when solar magnetic storms, which often interfere with telecommunication satellites, will hit Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volunteers anywhere in the world can register online to view photos on their Web browsers, and send their observations to researchers at the planetarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've found a meaningful way that somebody who doesn't have a Ph.D. in astronomy can actually work with astronomers collecting and analyzing data,'' said Paul H. Knappenberger Jr., president of the Adler Planetarium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planetarium is an ideal place for this kind of collaboration, Mr. Lintott said, because it is one of the few space museums in the world where educators and astronomers conduct research side by side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lintott said the project had the same image analyzed by dozens of observers, many of them high school or college students, to ensure accuracy. He found that a large group of volunteers could often turn up more accurate results quicker than a small group of scientists working with the same set of images. Astronomers review the data and then share it with institutions around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum and other Chicago museums have previously combined advanced research with public education initiatives. Citizen science gained a foothold here when the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum began enlisting local residents to record sightings of squirrels for researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the late 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Knappenberger said he expected Chicago's lead in citizen science to attract researchers from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is how a lot of science research will get done in the future,'' he said, ''and we'll be in a position to get those projects up and running.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- In a down payment on riches to come, scientists from NASA's Kepler satellite announced Monday that they had discovered the smallest planet yet found outside our solar system and the first that was unquestionably rocky, like the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planet, known as Kepler 10b, is only 40 percent larger than the Earth and about 4.6 times as massive, making it about as dense as Mercury. It is lethally hot, orbiting its star in 20 hours at a distance only one-twentieth of that of Mercury from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's a scorched world,'' said Natalie Batalha of San Jose State University, the member of the Kepler team who directed the study of the planet. She reported her findings at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society here and in a paper submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five hundred exoplanets, as planets around other stars are called, have been detected over the last 15 years. A vast majority of them are Jupiter-size giants, but as techniques have improved, astronomers have been able to detect smaller and smaller planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, a veteran exoplanet hunter and a member of the Kepler team, called the new planet a ''planetary missing link'' between those hot giants and the Earth-size habitable planets that astronomers hope Kepler and other space projects will uncover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's announcement, he said, ''I believe will be marked as among the most profound in human history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in 2009, searches for exoplanets by staring at 150,000 stars in a patch of sky between Cygnus and Lyra constellations, looking for dips in brightness caused by the passage of a planet in front of its home star. The goal is to find Earth-size planets in habitable orbits, meaning that liquid water can exist on their surfaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler 10b planet showed up early in the commissioning of the satellite after its launching. The Kepler astronomers could measure the planet's radius by the silhouette it cut in the star's light, and its mass by painstaking spectroscopic measurements made with the mighty Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii that showed by how much the planet's gravity was tugging its star back and forth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 10b's star is 560 light-years away and about eight billion years old. Dr. Batalha noted that when the light received by Kepler left that star, Europeans were beginning to embark on the great ocean voyages of discovery, ''looking for new horizons.'' We are doing the same thing, she went on: ''Our crow's nest is a spacecraft called Kepler.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years ago this month, Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, spotted an object in the night sky that was so bright and so far away that he was sure it was bigger than Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Guaranteed,'' Dr. Brown said when he announced the discovery, half a year later, in July 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well...maybe not, after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, that object, now known as the dwarf planet Eris, passed in front of a dim, distant star. Astronomers led by Bruno Sicardy of the Paris Observatory measured how long the star disappeared behind Eris and, from that, calculated the width of Eris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's clearly smaller,'' said Alain Maury, who observed the brief disappearance, or occultation, of the star at the San Pedro de Atacama Celestial Explorations Observatory in Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Drs. Maury and Sicardy decline to say exactly how small Eris is, because they first want to publish the results in the journal Nature. But they say that even accounting for the uncertainties in the observations, the largest possible Eris is smaller than the smallest possible Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news raises the question of what might have happened if Eris' true size had been known from the beginning. Dr. Brown's discovery of Eris -- and the presumption that it was bigger than Pluto -- was the falling domino that pushed the International Astronomical Union to come up with a new definition of ''planet'' that excluded Pluto. Pluto and Eris were downsized to ''dwarf planets'' -- roundish objects that do not gravitationally dominate their orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronomers had believed Pluto to be larger than Eris -- even slightly -- might they have kept the solar system at nine planets and sidestepped the ensuing kerfuffle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe,'' Dr. Brown said, although as he tells in his unapologetically titled book ''How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,'' he thinks the International Astronomical Union got it right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The occultation measurement -- which means Eris is not just smaller than expected but also incredibly shiny -- is the latest surprise of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris beyond Neptune. That belt turns out to be even stranger than astronomers thought a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And not everyone is yet convinced that Eris is definitely smaller than Pluto. Dr. Brown, for one, is perplexed. The occultation measurement seems to demonstrate convincingly that Eris' diameter is less than 2,360 kilometers, or 1,466 miles, Dr. Brown said. That is smaller than earlier estimates of 3,000 kilometers, based on infrared light from Eris, and 2,400 kilometers, based on Dr. Brown's observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he notes that a number of conflicting figures for the size of Pluto appear on various Web sites. Wikipedia, citing a 2006 scientific paper, puts the diameter at 2,306 kilometers, give or take 20 kilometers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now Pluto is bigger than Eris, ''because, um, 2,306 kilometers is greater than 2,360 kilometers?'' Dr. Brown asked, rhetorically and quizzically, on his blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delving further to make sense of the numbers, Dr. Brown did not question the yet-to-be-published Eris measurements by Dr. Sicardy's group, but rather concluded, ''I have to say: there is something fishy in the size of Pluto.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 80 years after Clyde W. Tombaugh spotted Pluto, astronomers still have not pinned down exactly how big, or small, it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Pluto was the magically shrinking planet. It was first thought to be about as large as Earth -- nearly 8,000 miles wide -- but subsequent measurements had it smaller and smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1980, Alexander J. Dessler, now at Texas A&amp;M University, and Christopher T. Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, published a graph of the mass estimates through the years and jokingly predicted that Pluto would disappear entirely in 1984. ''Those of you interested in observing Pluto should hurry,'' they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needless to say, the size of Pluto stabilized. Between 1985 and 1990, the orbit of Pluto's moon, Charon, was edge-on, as seen from Earth, and eclipses enabled astronomers to measure the diameters of Pluto and Charon more directly. Pluto has also passed in front of a few stars, too, just as Eris did in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was still not the end of the story. The surface of Pluto can reach a relatively balmy minus 360 degrees Fahrenheit, warm enough for some methane and nitrogen ices to evaporate and create an atmosphere, and the atmosphere bends light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pluto's atmosphere is kind of a like a crummy convergent lens,'' said Eliot F. Young, an astronomer at <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span>'s space studies department in Boulder, Colo., who was an author of the 2006 paper. ''Each ray is bent toward the center of Pluto.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, the true diameter of Pluto remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Young reanalyzed the stellar occultation data and found Pluto to be bigger, with the data compatible with a diameter as large as 2,400 kilometers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said, ''I don't think it's that big.'' The minimum diameter, according to his calculations, is about 2,300 kilometers, leaving a sizable uncertainty of 100 kilometers. ''This is embarrassing for me to talk about,'' Dr. Young said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris is about three times as far from the Sun as Pluto, much colder and almost completely devoid of any atmosphere to distort an occultation. So astronomers may now know Eris' size more accurately than Pluto's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the range of possible Pluto sizes seems to overlap the possible Eris sizes. ''If you looked at the two of them right next to each other sitting in space, they would look to be exactly the same size,'' Dr. Brown said. ''You couldn't tell by eye until you took out your really, really big ruler.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drs. Maury and Sicardy point to another estimate that finds a larger Pluto, based on the absorption of light by methane in Pluto's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That analysis, by Emmanuel Lellouch of the Paris Observatory, and his collaborators, who included Dr. Sicardy, said that to explain the patterns they saw, Pluto had to be at least 2,340 kilometers wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Young, while lauding the methane measurements, said that too much was still not known about the structure of Pluto's atmosphere to make that confident a conclusion about its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A precise, direct measurement of Pluto will finally come in 2015 when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is to fly past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smaller size of Eris would actually make it more interesting, Dr. Brown said. With less surface area, it would have to reflect almost all the light that hits it to explain how bright it is. And to explain the shininess, it must have a thin layer of methane and nitrogen frost -- the remnants of a thin atmosphere that froze as Eris moved along its elliptical orbit away from the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no other plausible explanation,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eris is currently almost nine billion miles from the Sun, but its elliptical, 557-year orbit takes it as close as 3.5 billion miles. Pluto's distance from the Sun varies between 2.7 billion and 4.6 billion miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, it is still the heavyweight of the Kuiper Belt -- 27 percent more massive than Pluto. The orbital period of Charon put a precise figure on Pluto's mass, and Eris' mass is similarly well measured because it too has a moon, named Dysnomia. That means Eris must have a much larger rocky core than Pluto, perhaps indicating that Pluto and Eris did not form in quite the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Kuiper Belt objects that Dr. Brown has discovered in the past decade have also shown the outer system to be more curious -- and violent -- than many would have expected. One of those is Haumea, a dwarf planet that is highly elongated and spins very fast, once every four hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only thing we could think that would cause it is if it got smacked, really hard, by something else early in the history of the solar system,'' Dr. Brown said, ''and everyone kind shook their head and said, well, no, that makes no sense, the probability of that happening is nearly zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Dr. Brown and his collaborators discovered two moons orbiting Haumea that looked like shards knocked off by an impact. Still, the skeptics doubted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, they found a dozen more pieces of Haumea, orbiting not around Haumea but around the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point, there is no question this thing suffered a giant impact,'' Dr. Brown said. ''I think we should have called it Humpty Dumpty instead of Haumea -- we can actually put this thing back together again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large Kuiper Belt objects also have tiny fragment moons, suggesting that giant impacts were not uncommon. Many of them are also rockier than expected; impacts could have knocked away outer layers of ice. Indeed, a giant, high-speed impact in Eris' past could be the reason it has less ice and more rock than Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent measurements indicate that the other large Kuiper Belt objects are also, like Eris, smaller and shinier than had been thought. The one known as Makemake now appears to be only 1,200 kilometers in diameter, not 1,500. Another, Quaoar, might be only 900 kilometers wide, compared with earlier estimates of 1,200 kilometers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves a sizable gap between Pluto and Eris and the next largest ones. ''It's a really strange distribution of sizes,'' Dr. Brown said. ''I don't think it's caught anybody's attention yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise since the discovery of Eris is that there has not been another Eris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown's sweep of the Kuiper Belt turned up a series of larger and larger objects -- up to Eris. After Eris, the search found nothing else of note. There was a possibility of another large Kuiper Belt object lurking in the Southern Hemisphere sky, out of view of the California telescope that Dr. Brown was using.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Scott S. Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution of Washington just completed a survey of the remaining sky, and he, too, found nothing large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is highly unlikely there are other Pluto-size objects'' in the Kuiper Belt, Dr. Sheppard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the Kuiper Belt, more mysteries await.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers want to find more objects like Sedna, which Dr. Brown discovered in 2003. Sedna is currently about three times as far from the Sun as Neptune, which is already outside of the Kuiper Belt. But at the other end of its 11,800-year elliptical orbit, Sedna will be 32 times as far out as Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And beyond Sedna is the Oort cloud, an even more distant collection of bodies astronomers have not yet found, but which they are absolutely certain exist. (Some of the comets that pass by the Sun originated in the Oort cloud but were gravitationally nudged to dive toward the inner solar system.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one of those more distant objects could turn out to be larger than one or more of the remaining eight planets, which could reignite the debate over what should be called a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could help resolve a sore point in the Brown household.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown originally wanted to name Eris after his daughter, Lilah, who was born three weeks before the discovery was announced. He imagined that when someone asked, ''Were you named after the planet?'' Lilah could retort, ''No, the planet was named after me.'' His wife, Diane, dissuaded him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown eventually settled on Eris, the Greek goddess of strife. Dysnomia, the moon, is a demon of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. Dr. Brown also chose that name because the first syllable is pronounced like the first syllable of Diane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilah, now in kindergarten, is one of the people upset with her father over Pluto. ''Killing is bad, and she knows I killed Pluto and therefore I'm a bad person,'' Dr. Brown said. ''And she would like me to do something about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown explained to Lilah why Pluto was no longer a planet. ''And she's fine with that,'' he said. ''She has a solution, which is an interestingly creative solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilah told him, ''Why don't you find another planet and name it Pluto?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's why I keep looking,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lilah still does not know she almost had a planet named after her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 19, 2011, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Jan. 11 about uncertainty surrounding the sizes of Pluto and the dwarf planet Eris misstated an estimate of Pluto's diameter by scientists at the Paris Observatory. They concluded it is at least 2,340 kilometers wide, not at least 2,360 kilometers wide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said Tuesday that it had figured out what caused the cracking in the fuel tank of the space shuttle Discovery, which has been grounded repeatedly because of technical problems. John Shannon, the shuttle program manager, said Tuesday that inferior material and assembly problems were to blame for the trouble, which included cracks in five aluminum alloy struts in the center of the tank. Those have been patched, NASA said, and technicians will reinforce the dozens of remaining struts as a precaution. Discovery's final voyage, to take supplies to the International Space Station, has been delayed since November. If the remaining repairs go well, it could fly as early as Feb. 24, NASA said. It refused to discuss the flight status of Mark Kelly, who is scheduled to command a shuttle flight in April. He is the husband of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in Arizona on Saturday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration cannot develop a heavy-lift rocket by the end of 2016 within the budget provided, the space agency told Congress this week. The blueprint specifying NASA's mission for the next three years, which was signed into law by President Obama, called for the development of a rocket that was capable of lifting at least 70 tons into orbit and that was based on technologies from the space shuttle and the smaller, soon-to-be-canceled Ares I rocket. In response, leaders of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which oversees NASA, reiterated that they expected NASA to find a way to fit a rocket design into the specified schedule and budget.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Astrologers, not surprisingly, say they knew this would happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that didn't stop a furious response among horoscope fans on Friday, as news shot around cyberspace -- and, no doubt, outer space -- that the world's zodiac signs might somehow be out of whack, a development with potentially life-changing impact on professional and personal relationships, pickup lines in singles' bars and, presumably, the day-to-day schedule of the former first lady Nancy Reagan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which left professional prognosticators seeking to calm their followers, and astronomers chuckling at the fate of their more metaphysical brethren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't panic,'' Lawrence Grecco, who has worked for 20 years as astrologer and life coach in Manhattan, assured his clients. ''Your sign is your sign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such assurances did little to quell the cosmic kerfuffle after The Star Tribune in Minneapolis innocuously reported Monday that a naturally occurring wobble in the direction of the Earth's axis -- technically known as a ''precession'' -- had altered the alignment of stars' overhead from their traditional star signs, which date back several millennia. The report, citing Parke Kunkle, a board member of the Minnesota Planetarium Society, quickly went viral. Mr. Kunkle, suddenly cast as the Man Who Changed the Zodiac, said he had just been commenting on a well-known fact about the stars in relation to astrology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of the shift resulted in existential, and occasionally grammatical, crises among Aries, Leos and even Ophuchices (more on this later) around the nation and online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My zodiac sign changed,'' wrote one upset Twitter user on Friday morning. ''Does that mean that I'm not anymore who I used to be?!?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, Capricorn, which astrologers say begins its monthlong term in December, actually starts on Jan. 20, based on the actual position of the stars. Aquarius, meanwhile, would be bumped to February. And so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say an ancient Greek astronomer was the first to recognize the precession of the Earth's axis, caused by the gravitational tug of the Moon and the Sun on a not-quite-round Earth. So it is, said Joe Rao, an associate and guest lecturer at the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the Hayden Planetarium, that ''over time the Earth's north pole is pointing toward different stars.'' Which means, in turn, that ''all of the zodiac positions which astrologers use as the foundation of their studies are inaccurate,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As are, of course, any predictions made from them, he added. ''This is, after all, the 21st century,'' Mr. Rao said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such scorn from skeptics is to be expected, said Rob Brezsny, the author of a syndicated weekly horoscope column, who added that the idea that the zodiac was shifting was just another attempt to discredit astrology, in which one in four Americans profess to believe, according to a 2009 Pew Research Center poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brezsny and other astrologers say they have long known that the pairings of constellations and astrological signs don't match, but that Western astrologers don't deal with stars -- as some other branches of astrology do -- but rather the planets and solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they're going to question its foundations,'' he said in an e-mail, referring to scientific skeptics, ''they should at least learn it well enough to know what they're talking about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brezsny said the argument that the zodiac was off kilter was old news but he was shocked how fast the Star Tribune article -- inspired by a blog item on the LiveScience Web site -- caught fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Friday, Monty Taylor, a veteran star man from Manhattan, said he and other astrologers were e-mailing, saying, ''Oh, here we go again. One step forward and two steps back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more shocking for some was the report that the 12-sign system would be adding a new, and ominously a 13th, sign -- Ophiuchus, the snake holder -- which ancient Babylonians dumped. (Maybe they were superstitious?). Its cycle runs from Nov. 29 to Dec. 17, making it the unofficial sign of Holiday Shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some likened it to the 2006 news that Pluto -- long considered the smallest, cutest planet -- was being reclassified as a dwarf planet. ''First we were told that Pluto is not a planet, now there's a new zodiac sign, Ophiuchus,'' read one tweet from someone with the handle HarryPotterish. ''My childhood was a bloody lie.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Duvendack, a St. Louis astrologer on the board of the Astrological Association of St. Louis, said he had been inundated with questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a lot of damage control,'' said Mr. Duvendack, fielding questions from shaken clients. ''I'm having to reassure them that this is all factored into astrology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all that, Mr. Brezsny and others said their craft would survive the confusion -- and the skeptics -- if only because its adherents are so passionate. ''Astrology is a poetic language of the soul, not a scientific method,'' he said, likening it to ''a Neruda poem, Kandinsky paintings or a Nick Cave song.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of those things are rational or scientific,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone was upset with the news of the supposed star shift. Mr. Duvendack said he had at least one astrology buff respond happily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A woman who told me she'd always felt there were one or two traits about Sagittarius that didn't fit her personality,'' Mr. Duvendack said. ''But that the new sign is spot on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRAWINGS: DRAWING (DRAWING BY CHRISTOPHER BRAND AND OLIVER MUNDAY) (A11); Changing Direction: The Earth wobbles, much as a spinning top wobbles, and as it does, the North Pole points to a different part of night sky. That shifts the position of all the stars, including the constellations that make up the astrological zodiac. Over a period of about 26,000 years, the changing North Pole, currently aimed at the star Polaris, traces out a circle in the night sky. Some 23,000 years from now, the sky will be more or less back to where it was when the Babylonians devised the astrological signs. (Source: University of Oregon) (A16)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a great many fields, researchers would give their eyeteeth to have a direct glimpse of the past. Instead, they generally have to piece together remote conditions using remnants like weathered fossils, decaying parchments or mummified remains. Cosmology, the study of the origin and evolution of the universe, is different. It is the one arena in which we can actually witness history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pinpoints of starlight we see with the naked eye are photons that have been streaming toward us for a few years or a few thousand. The light from more distant objects, captured by powerful telescopes, has been traveling toward us far longer than that, sometimes for billions of years. When we look at such ancient light, we are seeing -- literally -- ancient times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past decade, as observations of such ancient starlight have provided deep insight into the universe's past, they have also, surprisingly, provided deep insight into the nature of the future. And the future that the data suggest is particularly disquieting -- because of something called dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This story of discovery begins a century ago with Albert Einstein, who realized that space is not an immutable stage on which events play out, as Isaac Newton had envisioned. Instead, through his general theory of relativity, Einstein found that space, and time too, can bend, twist and warp, responding much as a trampoline does to a jumping child. In fact, so malleable is space that, according to the math, the size of the universe necessarily changes over time: the fabric of space must expand or contract -- it can't stay put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Einstein, this was an unacceptable conclusion. He'd spent 10 grueling years developing the general theory of relativity, seeking a better understanding of gravity, but to him the notion of an expanding or contracting cosmos seemed blatantly erroneous. It flew in the face of the prevailing wisdom that, over the largest of scales, the universe was fixed and unchanging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein responded swiftly. He modified the equations of general relativity so that the mathematics would yield an unchanging cosmos. A static situation, like a stalemate in a tug of war, requires equal but opposite forces that cancel each other. Across large distances, the force that shapes the cosmos is the attractive pull of gravity. And so, Einstein reasoned, a counterbalancing force would need to provide a repulsive push. But what force could that be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remarkably, he found that a simple modification of general relativity's equations entailed something that would have, well, blown Newton's mind: antigravity -- a gravitational force that pushes instead of pulls. Ordinary matter, like the Earth or Sun, can generate only attractive gravity, but the math revealed that a more exotic source -- an energy that uniformly fills space, much as steam fills a sauna, only invisibly -- would generate gravity's repulsive version. Einstein called this space-filling energy the cosmological constant, and he found that by finely adjusting its value, the repulsive gravity it produced would precisely cancel the usual attractive gravity coming from stars and galaxies, yielding a static cosmos. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen years later, however, Einstein rued the day he introduced the cosmological constant. In 1929, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies are all rushing away from us. And the best explanation for this cosmic exodus came directly from general relativity: much as poppy seeds in a muffin that's baking move apart as the dough swells, galaxies move apart as the space in which they're embedded expands. Hubble's observations thus established that there was no need for a cosmological constant; the universe is not static.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had Einstein only trusted the original mathematics of general relativity, he would have made one of the most spectacular predictions of all time -- that the universe is expanding -- more than a decade before it was discovered. Instead, he was left to lick his wounds, summarily removing the cosmological constant from the equations of general relativity and, according to one of his trusted colleagues, calling it his greatest blunder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the story of the cosmological constant was far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to the 1990s, when we find two teams of astronomers undertaking painstakingly precise observations of distant supernovae -- exploding stars so brilliant they can be seen clear across the cosmos -- to determine how the expansion rate of space has changed over the history of the universe. These researchers anticipated that the gravitational attraction of matter dotting the night's sky would slow the expansion, much as Earth's gravity slows the speed of a ball tossed upward. By bearing witness to distant supernovae, cosmic beacons that trace the universe's expansion rate at various moments in the past, the teams sought to make this quantitative. Shockingly, however, when the data were analyzed, the teams found that the expansion rate has not been slowing down. It's been speeding up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's as if that tossed ball shot away from your hand, racing upward faster and faster. You'd conclude that something must be driving the ball away. Similarly, the astronomers concluded that something in space must be pushing galaxies apart ever more quickly. And after scrutinizing the situation, they have found that the push is most likely the repulsive gravity produced by a cosmological constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Einstein introduced the cosmological constant, he envisioned its value being finely adjusted to exactly balance ordinary attractive gravity. But for other values the cosmological constant's repulsive gravity can beat out attractive gravity, and yield the observed accelerated spatial expansion, spot on. Were Einstein still with us, his discovery that repulsive gravity lies within nature's repertoire would have likely garnered him another Nobel prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As remarkable as it is that even one of Einstein's ''bad'' ideas has proven prophetic, many puzzles still surround the cosmological constant: If there is a diffuse, invisible energy permeating space, where did it come from? Is this dark energy (to use modern parlance) a permanent fixture of space, or might its strength change over time? Perhaps most perplexing of all is a question of quantitative detail. The most refined attempts to calculate the amount of dark energy suffusing space miss the measured value by a gargantuan factor of 10123 (that is, a 1 followed by 123 zeroes) -- the single greatest mismatch between theory and observation in the history of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THESE are vital questions that rank among today's deepest mysteries. But standing beside them is an unassailable conclusion, one that's particularly unnerving. If the dark energy doesn't degrade over time, then the accelerated expansion of space will continue unabated, dragging away distant galaxies ever farther and ever faster. A hundred billion years from now, any galaxy that's not resident in our neighborhood will have been swept away by swelling space for so long that it will be racing from us at faster than the speed of light. (Although nothing can move through space faster than the speed of light, there's no limit on how fast space itself can expand.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light emitted by such galaxies will therefore fight a losing battle to traverse the rapidly widening gulf that separates us. The light will never reach Earth and so the galaxies will slip permanently beyond our capacity to see, regardless of how powerful our telescopes may become.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of this, when future astronomers look to the sky, they will no longer witness the past. The past will have drifted beyond the cliffs of space. Observations will reveal nothing but an endless stretch of inky black stillness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If astronomers in the far future have records handed down from our era, attesting to an expanding cosmos filled with galaxies, they will face a peculiar choice: Should they believe ''primitive'' knowledge that speaks of a cosmos very much at odds with what anyone has seen for billions and billions of years? Or should they focus on their own observations and valiantly seek explanations for an island universe containing a small cluster of galaxies floating within an unchanging sea of darkness -- a conception of the cosmos that we know definitively to be wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what if future astronomers have no such records, perhaps because on their planet scientific acumen developed long after the deep night sky faded to black? For them, the notion of an expanding universe teeming with galaxies would be a wholly theoretical construct, bereft of empirical evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've grown accustomed to the idea that with sufficient hard work and dedication, there's no barrier to how fully we can both grasp reality and confirm our understanding. But by gazing far into space we've captured a handful of starkly informative photons, a cosmic telegram billions of years in transit. And the message, echoing across the ages, is clear. Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law. Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And yet it moves ...'' Galileo is said to have muttered to himself after recanting his heretical notion that the Earth orbited the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To most people living in 1633, the idea that something as expansive and firm as the Earth was not the center of the universe was still a ridiculous notion. But only with the acceptance that the Earth is actually a small rock going around the Sun did the study of the heavens start to make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geology had a similar intellectual blind spot just 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space age had already begun, the first computers were crunching numbers, and yet many, if not most, earth scientists thought the continents were stuck, unmoving on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American geologists were particularly stubborn. ''I had been told as an undergraduate at M.I.T. that good scientists did not work on foolish ideas like continental drift,'' recalled Lynn Sykes, an emeritus professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The field of geology in 1960, when Dr. Sykes began his graduate studies at the Lamont Geological Observatory at Columbia, was much like biology a century earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geologists studied individual rock formations the way biologists catalogued animal and plant species. Only after ''On the Origin of Species,'' published in 1859, did the theory of evolution tie together the study of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1960, geologists still did not have a framework to understand volcanoes, earthquakes and other processes that shape Earth. Dr. Sykes said he thought that his adviser, Jack Oliver, was also not a believer in continental drift. Within a decade, the research of Dr. Oliver, who died recently at age 87, Dr. Sykes and others had made the notion of static continents as quaint and archaic as the stationary Earth that Galileo was forced to accept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's now difficult to see why we didn't get it,'' Dr. Sykes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German geophysicist Alfred Wegener had proposed in 1912 that the continents were once all connected, then broke up and drifted apart. Wegener was not the first to notice that the east coast of South America seemed to fit together with the west coast of Africa, but he assembled a wealth of geological and fossil evidence to support the theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reception was often hostile. Critics pointed out that Wegener's explanation for why continents would drift -- that the spinning of the Earth caused them to plow through the ocean crust -- could not work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in the 1960s, new data led scientists to take a closer look. Dr. Sykes was studying shallow earthquakes that occurred along midocean ridges, and Dr. Oliver, along with Bryan Isacks, another Lamont scientist, were exploring deep earthquakes near Fuji and Tonga in the South Pacific. In 1968, the three wrote a landmark paper that was for many the convincing proof for the emerging theory of plate tectonics, showing how all those different seismic signals made sense if the Earth's crust were broken up into separate plates that slowly slid around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As plates pull apart, crash together, slide past each other, they fuel volcanoes, generate earthquakes and push up mountains. The San Andreas Fault made sense, as did midocean ridges where tectonic plates pull apart and form new ocean floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of the really great breakthroughs in science are unifications,'' said Owen J. Gingerich, a science historian at Harvard. Newton's laws of motion unified the sky and Earth as ruled by the same physics; that was radically different from the earlier Aristotelian concept, in which the two realms were separate. Einstein's laws of relativity unified space and time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, plate tectonics was an enormous unifying theory that began to make sense of disparate sorts of phenomena,'' Dr. Gingerich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In planetary astronomy, there has been in recent years another shift -- in this case, away from the quaint notion that the planets have always been following the same orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Russian-American scholar Immanuel Velikovsky wrote ''Worlds in Collision'' in 1950, describing catastrophic near collisions and the wandering of planets, astronomers dismissed it as crank science. After all, how could anything push around the planets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The particulars of Velikovsky's suppositions, based on readings of mythology, are still crank science, but the history of the solar system is now widely accepted as much more chaotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new model has the giant planets forming much closer together, with Uranus and Neptune bunched closer to where Jupiter and Saturn are today. Then their orbits became unstable and Uranus and Neptune were flung outward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this context, the formation of giant planets makes more sense. (Otherwise, for instance, there would not have been enough material where Uranus is now to form Uranus.) So do the orbits of the icy bodies beyond Neptune, including Pluto, which would have been scattered by the wild orbits of Neptune and Uranus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the universe, almost everything moves and changes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where to next? And when?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA, as it attempts to squeeze a workable human spaceflight program into a tight federal budget, the answers appear to be ''somewhere'' and ''not anytime soon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the space shuttles are retired this year -- and only one flight remains for each of the three -- NASA will no longer have its own means for getting American astronauts to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What comes next is a muddle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program to send astronauts back to the moon, known as Constellation, was canceled last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its place, Congress has asked NASA to build a heavy-lift rocket, one that can go deep into space carrying big loads. But NASA says it cannot possibly build such a rocket with the budget and schedule it has been given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another crucial component of NASA's new mission -- helping commercial companies develop space taxis for taking astronauts into orbit -- is getting less money than the Obama administration requested. Companies like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> that are interested in bidding for the work do not yet know whether they can make a profitable venture of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the future of NASA, ''it's hard at this point to speculate,'' Douglas R. Cooke, associate administrator for NASA's exploration systems mission directorate, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel that oversees safety at NASA took note of the uncertainty in its annual report, released this month. ''What is NASA's exploration mission?'' the members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel asked in their report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel added: ''It is not in the nation's best interest to continue functioning in this manner. The Congress, the White House, and NASA must quickly reach a consensus position on the future of the agency and the future of the United States in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nagging worry is that compromises will leave NASA without enough money to accomplish anything, and that -- even as billions of dollars are spent -- the future destination and schedule of NASA's rockets could turn out to be ''nowhere'' and ''never.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that case, human spaceflight at NASA would consist just of its work aboard the International Space Station, with the Russians providing the astronaut transportation indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're on a path with an increasing probability of a bad outcome,'' said Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now directs the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA study, completed last month, came up with a framework for spaceflight in the two next decades but deferred setting specific destinations, much less timetables for getting there. One of the study's conclusions was that trying to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 -- as President Obama had challenged the agency to do in a speech last April -- was ''not prudent,'' because it would be too expensive and narrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the study advocated a ''capability-driven framework'' -- developing elements like spacecraft, propulsion systems and deep-space living quarters that could be used and reused for a variety of exploration missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in Washington, the fight is less of a conflict of grand visions than a squabble over dollars and the design details of a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, in passing an authorization act for NASA, which laid out a blueprint for the next three years, Congress called for NASA to start work on the heavy-lift rocket. It also said that the design should be based on available technologies from the existing space shuttles and from Constellation; that the rocket should be ready by the end of 2016, and that NASA could have about $11.5 billion to develop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who helped shape the NASA blueprint, said, ''If we can't do it for that, then we ought to question whether or not we can build a rocket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blueprint, signed into law by President Obama in October, gave NASA 90 days to explain how it would build the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, the agency told Congress that it had decided on preferred designs for the rocket and the crew capsule for carrying astronauts, but could yet not fit them into the schedule and constraints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All our models say 'no,' '' said Elizabeth Robinson, NASA's chief financial officer, ''even models that have generous affordability considerations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said NASA was continuing to explore how it might reduce costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of days after receiving the report, Senator Nelson said he had talked to the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., and ''told him he has to follow the law, which requires a new rocket by 2016.'' He added, ''And NASA has to do it within the budget the law requires.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The track record for large aerospace development projects, both inside and outside of NASA, is that they almost always take longer and cost more than initially estimated. If costs for the heavy-lift rocket swell, the project could, as Constellation did, divert money from other parts of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, many NASA observers wonder how the agency can afford to finance both the heavy-lift rocket and the commercial space taxis, which are supposed to begin flying at about the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're setting themselves up again for a long development program whose completion is beyond the horizon,'' James A. M. Muncy, a space policy consultant, said of the current heavy-lift design. ''The question is, what does Congress want more? Do they want to just want to keep the contractors on contract, or do they want the United States to explore space?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the situation at NASA ''a train wreck,'' one ''where everyone involved knows it's a train wreck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constellation, started in 2005 under the Bush administration, aimed to return to the moon by 2020 and set up a base there in the following years. But Constellation never received as much money as originally promised, which slowed work and raised the overall price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barack Obama was running for president, he said he supported the moon goal. But after he took office, he did not show much enthusiasm for it. His request for the 2010 fiscal year did not seek immediate cuts in Constellation but trimmed the projected spending in future years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration also set up a blue-ribbon panel, led by Norman Augustine, a former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, to review the program. The panel found that Constellation could not fit into the projected budget -- $100 billion over 10 years -- and would need $45 billion more to get back on track. Extending the space station five years beyond 2015 would add another $14 billion, the group concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel could not find an alternative that would fit, either. It said that for a meaningful human spaceflight program that would push beyond low-Earth orbit, NASA would need $128 billion -- $28 billion more than the administration wanted to spend -- over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the country was not willing to spend that much, NASA should be asked to do less, the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last February, when unveiling the budget request for fiscal year 2011, the Obama administration said it wanted to cancel Constellation, turn to commercial companies for transportation to low-Earth orbit and invest heavily in research and development on technologies for future deep-space missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama budget requested more money for NASA -- but for other parts of the agency like robotic science missions and aviation. The proposed allotment for human spaceflight was still at levels that the Augustine committee had said were not workable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In pushing to cancel Constellation, one Obama administration official after another called it ''unexecutable,'' so expensive that it limped along for years without discernible progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that we poured $9 billion into an unexecutable program really isn't an excuse to pour another $50 billion into it and still not have an executable program,'' said James Kohlenberger, chief of staff of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, at a news conference last February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same news conference, Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, noted that Constellation, without a budget increase, would not reach the moon until well after the 2020 target. ''The Augustine report made it clear that we wouldn't have gotten to beyond low Earth orbit until 2028 and even then would not have the funding to build the lander,'' she said. But with the new road map, NASA may not get to its destinations any faster. As for the ultimate goal of landing people on Mars, which President Obama said he wanted NASA to accomplish by the mid-2030s, it is even slipping further into the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "C-word," climate, appears to have become to the Beltway what&nbsp;the "P-word," population, has been in climate treaty negotiations for a long time - unmentionable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one thing to cave to a wave of naysaying climate rhetoric and build a new American energy conversation on points of agreement rather than clear ideological flash points like global warming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's another to duck and cover entirely on climate, as President Obama did in his State of the Union message. (Mind you,&nbsp;climate hawks shouldn't feel too personally dissed; keep in mind that Obama didn't mention any of the many other reasons for expanding the cleaner energy menu -- including reducing dependence on Middle Eastern oil -- either.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One approach to bringing up climate could have been to build on the broader message of civil discourse reflected in the way lawmakers seated themselves. He could have nodded to the&nbsp;deep divisions over climate science and policies, but noted that much of the sense of controversy has come mainly because the hottest messages --&nbsp;unfolding catastrophe, manufactured hoax -- get the most air time. This obscures&nbsp;the climate basics that provide one of the many reasons to push hard and long on advancing non-fossil energy sources. That was&nbsp;Richard Smalley's wise approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, this address was almost entirely about the economy, and innovation, so I can understand avoiding a digression on climate -- as long as the broad case for an energy quest is built by the president in weeks and months to come.&nbsp;At a Washington meeting last spring on adapting to climate change, Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, said that he expected&nbsp;"a major speech" on climate from Obama down the line. This year, if the president doesn't engage with voters on&nbsp;America's Climate Choices, his campaign pledge to have science treated with integrity will appear awfully hollow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama's address was appropriately focused on building a new sustained era of American prosperity using a mix of austerity and smartly targeted long-term investments in education and science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He discussed, appropriately, the need for a short-term strategy in which all existing sources play a role -- from wind turbines and nuclear reactors to&nbsp;natural gas and -- yes -- coal (although I still feel he and Congress are biasing federal research and development money far too much toward coal interests through spending on&nbsp;capturing CO2 from power plants).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke inspiringly of the country's energy innovation imperative last night. It was great to see the Department of Energy's&nbsp;Innovation Hubs singled out for more support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama clearly picked up on bipartisan interest in eliminating distorting energy subsidies, but sadly targeted only oil subsidies in seeking the billions he wants for research and innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bias toward punishing the oil industry, leaving out the huge bonbons handed out to big coal and biofuels, is bound to stir up a fight rather than resolve one. That's one reason that some "green" subsidies would need to go, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His summary point on this being a new "Sputnik moment" raises some interesting questions (particularly its focus on building the energy quest as an us-versus-them race). Several reactions to that message can be found below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a heap of analysis and reaction around the Web. I particularly liked&nbsp;Bryan Walsh's riff at Time Magazine. What themes and gaps inspired, or exasperated, you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are a few parting thoughts from people with useful perspectives on the differences between a space race and an energy quest:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burton Richter, Nobel laureate in physics:The President talked about Sputnik, which inspired the Eisenhower administration to sharply increase investment in education, and in all areas of science and technology.&nbsp; The President mentioned the role of government in innovation, but Congress does not seem to have appreciated what the federal role has been.&nbsp; Simply put, industry does not innovate; industry turns federally funded innovations into products.&nbsp; Nobel laureates said it in 2009.&nbsp; The National Academies of Sciences said it in 2010.&nbsp; The American Enterprise Institute, Brookings and the Breakthrough Institute said it recently in a report called "Post-Partisan Power."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's corporate leaders also said it recently in a report from The American Energy Innovation Council.&nbsp; Every basic technology in one of the products of the decade, the iPhone (and the Blackberry before it), came from government funded research; the internet, the GPS system, large scale integrated circuits, and even the touch screen, (see "Where Good Technologies Come From").</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without industry there would be no product.&nbsp; Without government funded R&amp;D there would be no innovative technology to turn into products.&nbsp; To both Congress and the Administration I would say back the pieties with the funds required to realize them.Andrew Hargadon, professor and Soderquist Chair in Entrepreneurship, University of California, Davis, Graduate School of Management:Was the U.S. investment in research and education what put a man on the moon? I would have guessed it was political commitment, public support, and all of the necessary pieces of technology essentially nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing the challenge of developing clean technologies to putting a man on the moon is politically enticing, but NASA didn't have to deal with an aging infrastructure, 6-sigma uptime requirements over an average 40 year product life-cycle, commodity-priced competition, or reluctant customers. NASA had to do it once, with all new equipment, for whatever it cost, and the moon had no choice in the adoption decision. Try that with new energy technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, we need a wholesale change in how we think about innovation. The notion that putting a man on the moon takes the same innovation process as solar on every roof, electric cars in every garage, or LEDs in every home simply reveals that federal innovation policy is funded on misbegotten assumptions.Andrew Chaikin, author of a comprehensive history of the Apollo space program:People who are not scientists or engineers often confuse the two. Science is about refining our understanding of how the universe works. Engineering is about taking that understanding and using it to create new technologies or devices. With Apollo, the basic science of going to the moon - that is, how a rocket works, how you use the laws of physics to travel from one celestial body to another - was understood long before NASA was created. But building the machines that would actually make it happen took years of intensive engineering work, to refine the existing technologies of rockets, and pressure suits, and fuel cells, and other devices. Still, back in those days, newspaper stories (including many in the NYT) often referred to engineers working for NASA as "scientists." And even today, we talk about "rocket scientists" when we should be talking about "rocket engineers." Of course, there was plenty of wonderful science in Apollo: All the discoveries made about the Moon and the solar system from the rocks, photos, and data the astronauts brought home. But they would never have gotten there in the first place without engineers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leapfrogging into the past with the refurbished Hubble Space Telescope, a team of astronomers says it has detected what may be the most distant and earliest galaxy yet found. It is a smudge of light only a tiny fraction of the size of our own Milky Way galaxy, and it existed when the universe was only 480 million years old. Its light has been on its way to us for 13.2 billion years, making it the long-distance champion in an expanding universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If confirmed, the discovery takes astronomers deep into an era when stars and galaxies were first lighting up the universe and burning their way out of a primordial fog known as the dark ages. The birth rate of stars, they concluded from their observations, increased tenfold in the 200 million years between the time of the newly discovered galaxy and the next earliest known galaxies, which date to 650 million years after the Big Bang -- a rate even faster than astronomers had thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is clearly an era when galaxies were evolving rapidly,'' the astronomers said in an article published Wednesday in the journal Nature. The team was led by Rychard J. Bouwens of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, and Garth Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after the Hubble was refurbished in 2009, Dr. Bouwens and his colleagues observed a patch of sky known as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field in the constellation Fornax with the telescope's new Wide Field Camera 3, which is sensitive to the long-wave ''heat'' radiation known as infrared. That is important because as galaxies fly away from us in the expanding universe, the light they emit is shifted to longer wavelengths -- ''red-shifted,'' in cosmological parlance -- the way a receding siren sounds lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That data yielded a crop of galaxies dating from 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang and a hint of the even earlier galaxy, in which visible light appears to have been shifted all the way into the infrared by a factor of 10, corresponding to a time of only 480 million years after the universe began. After a year of testing and simulations, the team concluded that it was the most primordial galaxy yet found. Spectroscopic observations with the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope, however, are needed to cement the identification of the smudge as a galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the new result fits in well with a picture cosmologists have developed from a variety of sources. In it, the first stars formed around 200 million or 300 million years after the Big Bang, and then the universe continued building more and more stars, reaching a peak of fecundity when it was about two and a half billion years old. Its glory days behind it, the cosmos is now in a middle-age slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They leave unclear, however, a longstanding mystery as to how the universe became transparent. As the initial fires of the Big Bang cooled, cosmologists say, the universe was enveloped in a pea-soup fog of hydrogen gas. Over the next billion years, that fog lifted as the hydrogen atoms were stripped of their electrons -- ionized -- by high-energy radiation, presumably from the early stars, and became transparent. The problem is that astronomers disagree on whether they have been able to find enough stars or galaxies in the very early universe yet to account for the amount of light it would have taken to burn off all the fog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, some astronomers have suggested that massive black holes could have been partly or mostly responsible for clearing the dark ages. The black holes would have whipped the space around them with high-energy particles and radiation shed by matter in its death throes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bouwens said it was not quite time to resort to black holes as the explanation, however; he noted that many more galaxies could be lurking in the noise just below the limits of detection for the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really are not probing faint enough with the current Hubble observations to see beyond the tip of the iceberg,'' Dr. Bouwens said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb telescope, which is expected to be launched later this decade once NASA figures out how to pay for it, has been designed to find these primordial galaxies and thus illuminate the dark ages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-five years ago on Friday, on an unusually cold morning, the space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff, killing all seven astronauts. Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist and a member of the presidential commission investigating the disaster, quickly zeroed in the cause: a failure of the O-rings, seals designed to prevent hot gases from leaking through the joint on the rocket booster. Here's how he did it, as The Times's Philip M. Boffey reported two weeks after the accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After a lunch break today, Dr. Feynman told the panel that he had just conducted an impromptu experiment with the rubbery material used for the giant circular rings that seal the rocket joints. He said he had immersed a piece of the material in ice water and found that it lost resiliency, a factor that space officials had said was important to the effective operation of the O-ring seals.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Representative Gabrielle Giffords settles into a rehabilitation hospital in Houston, a major question remains for her husband, the astronaut Mark E. Kelly: Will he fly or not?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly, a Navy officer who flew 39 combat missions in the Persian Gulf war, is scheduled to fly the shuttle Endeavour on a two-week mission to the International Space Station in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his wife at the beginning of a long and arduous rehabilitation program to recover from a gunshot wound to the head, Captain Kelly and his bosses at NASA will have to determine whether he can maintain the training regimen in the weeks leading up to the launching and command the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be Captain Kelly's fourth trip to space, but with the shuttle program winding down, giving up this flight would almost certainly mean also giving up his last chance to command a shuttle mission. No shuttle commander has ever been removed so close to a launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not there yet,'' Stephanie Schierholz, a NASA spokeswoman, said of when Captain Kelly and NASA's leadership would decide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While working through the decision, NASA has kept its options open by naming a backup commander for the mission, Frederick W. Sturckow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark is still the commander,'' said Peggy A. Whitson, the chief astronaut, but she said that having a backup commander would allow the crew to continue training and Captain Kelly to ''focus on his wife's care.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly, who is on leave, said in the NASA announcement of a backup commander that he had recommended the step ''to prepare to complete the mission in my absence, if necessary.'' But he added that he was ''very hopeful that I will be in a position to rejoin'' the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John M. Logsdon, an emeritus professor of political science and international affairs at the Space Policy Institute of George Washington University, said, ''I don't envy them the choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark is not irreplaceable for this mission,'' Professor Logsdon said, ''and naming a backup is the prudent thing for NASA to do. There are many highly qualified shuttle commanders. But to lose this opportunity would be personally very hard for him, since it would most likely be his last chance to go to space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly might be able to return to orbit, ferried aloft by a Russian Soyuz, as part of an expedition on the space station, as his brother Scott is now doing. But strapping into the left seat of the shuttle's forward flight deck is the pinnacle of the pilot's calling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ultimate decision involves weighing Captain Kelly's determination to achieve a goal he has trained so long for and the needs of his family, as well as NASA's need to have a commander whose concentration and focus are unwavering and the cohesiveness of a crew that has worked closely to achieve a common goal. NASA has no rigid rules about removing crew members from missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Navy, where Captain Kelly got his training, has taken pilots who are going through family crises off flight status, but the decisions are made by the commanding officer with advice from a ''human factors board'' that involves flight surgeons and officers, said Lt. Aaron Kakiel, a Navy spokesman. ''There's no automatic something that triggers something else,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle crew members have been replaced because of illness or family crises. In 1997, Jeffrey S. Ashby, a retired Navy captain, was replaced on what would have been his first shuttle mission when his wife, Diana, was diagnosed with terminal cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven A. Hawley, a former astronaut who flew with Captain Ashby on a later mission, recalled that ''he didn't have the ability to focus properly on the mission,'' and that Captain Ashby had recommended the move himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always admired that very much,'' Dr. Hawley said. ''That someone would have the presence of mind to recognize that that was going on and make that courageous and appropriate decision -- you don't always assume people will do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experienced fighter pilots like Captain Kelly are better equipped than most to deal with personal crises, said N. Wayne Hale Jr., a former director of the shuttle program who left NASA last year. ''Folks who are in the business -- particularly those who came up as military pilots -- are very good at compartmentalizing the work they have to do in the cockpits of the spacecraft from their personal lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had commanders who had plenty of personal angst in their lives, and they flew great flights,'' Mr. Hale said. ''It really comes down to where he thinks his priorities and his mental state are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, if Ms. Giffords's recovery is on track, she might urge her husband to take on the challenge, said George Abbey, a former director of the Johnson Space Center. ''I think Gabrielle would want him to fly,'' he said. ''She is a great supporter of his career. She would say fly, but I think a lot of it is really going to be up to Mark.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Abbey also suggested that the launching might be delayed, as often happens. ''He's going to get more time,'' Mr. Abbey predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronaut community is tight, bound by common careers and experiences, and by tragedy. Today's members of the astronaut corps lost colleagues and friends when the shuttle Columbia broke up during its return to Earth in February 2003. From the fire aboard Apollo 1 that killed three astronauts to the loss of 14 astronauts in the shuttles Columbia and Challenger, which broke apart after liftoff in 1986, astronauts and their families say they are open about the worst that might happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he prepared for his 2006 mission, Captain Kelly answered questions from NASA's media office about the risks astronauts prepare for. ''Strapping into a rocket ship is something you don't do lightly,'' he said, adding that he had talked to his daughters about the risks, which they knew well having grown up with the children of astronauts who died in the Columbia accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those risks, he said, have to be balanced against reward. ''It's not just the personal benefit to me; it's what's the benefit of our space program to our country and to the planet, and I think that's -- that's pretty, pretty big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while astronauts and their families may be better prepared for crisis than others, the danger is usually associated with the astronauts, not their families, said Eileen Hawley, a former NASA public affairs official and the wife of Dr. Hawley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're a community that's typically prepared for risk, and we understand it,'' she said, ''but not when it's something like this.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOFFETT FIELD, Calif. -- In a building at NASA's Ames Research Center here, computers are sifting and resifting the light from 156,000 stars, seeking to find in the flickering of distant suns the first hints that humanity is not alone in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stars are being monitored by a $600 million satellite observatory named Kepler, whose job is to conduct a kind of Gallup poll of worlds in the cosmos. On Wednesday, Kepler's astronomers are scheduled to unveil a closely kept list of 400 stars that are their brightest and best bets so far for harboring planets, some of which could turn out to be the smallest and most Earth-like worlds discovered out there to date. They represent the first glimpse of riches to come in a quest that is as old as the imagination and as new as the iPad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next two or three years, as Kepler continues to stare and sift, astronomers say, it will be able to detect planets in the ''Goldilocks'' zones, where it is neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we want is to find life,'' said Geoffrey Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, who is part of the Kepler team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Borucki, 72, the lead scientist, who has spent the last 20 years getting Kepler off the ground, said recently in an interview in his office: ''I've argued that Kepler is more important than the Hubble Space Telescope. We provide the data mankind needs to move out into space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are science-fiction times. Kepler is only the first step in a process that experts agree will take decades. Both NASA and the European Space Agency have laid plans for a multidecade quest -- employing ever more sophisticated and expensive spacecraft -- for planets and life beyond Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A roving robot laboratory named Curiosity will depart for Mars on a $2.5 billion mission this fall. Astronomers argue whether the next such mission should go to Jupiter's moon Europa, with its subsurface ocean; Saturn's moon Titan, which is coated with a methane slush; or another of Saturn's moons, Enceladus, which is spouting geysers of water from its interior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, humans cannot even summon the money or political will to get back to the Moon, let alone set sail for another star. It would take 300,000 years for Voyager 1, now on the way out of the solar system at 39,000 miles per hour, to travel the 20 light-years, or 120 trillion miles, to Gliese 581, one of the nearest planetary systems; Kepler's planets are from 500 to 3,000 light-years away. NASA and other organizations, like the Planetary Society, have experimented with devices like solar sails, in which a craft is pushed by sunlight or a powerful laser, and ion drives, in which high-energy particles do the propelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is more than just an intellectual exercise, scientists say. Traditional religious images of ourselves as God's creatures, or even of God, could be in for a rough time if we ever discover pond scum living by completely alien chemical rules on some moon or planet, let alone the Borg -- the alien race ruled by a collective mind on ''Star Trek'' -- inhabiting some distant realm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, as astronomers keep reminding us, humanity will eventually lose Earth as its home, whether because of global warming or the ultimate plague or a killer asteroid or the Sun's inevitable demise. Before then, if we want the universe to remember us or even know we were here, we need to get away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only in 1995 that a team of Swiss astronomers led by Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory discovered the first planet of another Sun-like star using what is now known as the ''wobble'' method. A planet gives its star a little gravitational tug as it goes around, causing the star to go back and forth, or wobble, a little as both star and planet circle the same center of gravity. They detected a wobble in the motion of the star 51 Pegasi as an object about half the mass of Jupiter whipped around it every four days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Olives in a Martini Glass</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next decade, Dr. Mayor's group and another planet-hunting team led by Dr. Marcy and R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution leapfrogged each other in finding exoplanets, as they are called. More and more astronomers have joined the hunt, discovering smaller and smaller planets. Astronomers have recorded direct images of four planets swirling like olives in a martini glass around a star known as HR 8799, 130 light-years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus, and another circling Fomalhaut, only 25 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Piscis Austrinus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now more than 500 planets listed on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's PlanetQuest Web site. None are habitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them is the so-called Styrofoam planet -- an early trophy of Kepler's -- a planet that is again half as large as Jupiter, but so puffed up by the heat of its star that it is only one-tenth as dense. Another is a planet composed almost entirely of superheated water and sometimes called the Steam World; it is known as Gliese 1214b, about 40 light-years from here in the constellation Ophiuchus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a team of American astronomers announced that they had discovered a Goldilocks planet orbiting a dim red dwarf star at just the right distance to harbor water on its surface, making it a potential site for life. Gliese 581g, as it is known, is part of the Gliese 581 system 20 light-years from here, in Libra. But then the Swiss astronomers who first spotted that system were not able to find the Goldilocks planet in their own data, causing many astronomers, but not its discoverers, to doubt that the friendly 581g was real.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler project grew out of Mr. Borucki's lifelong love of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki grew up in a small town in Wisconsin, shooting homemade rockets into the sky and praying that they did not hit a neighbor's cow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a kid, this is what you wanted to do,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After getting a master's degree in physics from the University of Wisconsin, he went to work on the Apollo Moon program, becoming an expert in precise measurements of light. In 1984, he suggested that such measurements could be used to look for planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is that a planet passing in front of its star would block a little of its light -- very little. In the case of the Earth, the dip would amount to 84 parts per million in the Sun's light -- less than a hundredth of a percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1993, when Mr. Borucki and his collaborators proposed building a satellite to do such measurements, NASA said, ''If doable, it's fabulous,'' recalled David Koch of the University of Wisconsin, Mr. Borucki's longtime collaborator. But NASA did not think detectors could be so precise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA rejected their proposal a year later, then again two years after that. ''It's a wonderful thing to have someone tell you over and over again everything that is wrong with your experiment,'' Mr. Borucki said. That was the road to improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, NASA turned the scientists down again, but gave them half a million dollars to spend on lab work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler mission finally got the nod from NASA in 2001, but with a twist. The Ames Research Center wound up handing over management of the mission, at least until the launching, to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which developed the Vikings and Voyagers. ''Here we had been competing against J.P.L. all these years,'' Dr. Koch said. ''We got over that.'' Control has since reverted to Ames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched from Cape Canaveral into an orbit around the Sun on March 6, 2009. Its gaze is fixed on a patch of sky about 20 full moons across near the Northern Cross, in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, containing about 4.5 million stars. That is the neighborhood for Kepler's cosmic census. The job is simply to measure the brightness of 156,000 of those stars every half-hour, looking for the repeated dips caused by planet crossings, or ''transits.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more times a planet crosses its star, the more easily it is picked up and tagged by computers analyzing Kepler's data. And Kepler's first hits were indeed of planets that orbited their suns in a few days in close orbits that would produce oven-cleaner temperatures. The Earth, of course, takes a year to go around the Sun, so it would take two or three years for its analogue orbiting some star in Cygnus to show up in the Kepler data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will find Earth-size planets in habitable zones,'' Dr. Marcy stated flatly last month in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Required: Absolute Proof</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a hitch to confirming those planets, however. Such planets would not exert enough of a gravitational tug on their suns to be detectable by the ''wobble'' method, the main way their masses can be measured. Instead of confirming such planets, Kepler astronomers talk about ''validating'' them by using high-powered telescopes to make sure, for example, that there is only one star there and not a pair of eclipsing stars or some other phenomenon that could mimic a planet's shadow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Earths are difficult,'' Mr. Borucki said. ''We're concerned not to announce anything until we've proven six different ways it can't not be a planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, more and more of Kepler's future pronouncements will be statistical in nature. Natalie Batalha of San Jose State University, the deputy science team leader for Kepler, said it could be that they will wind up with, say, 100 planets they are 80 percent sure of, which could translate to 80 planets -- useful for a census, not so helpful if you're looking for a place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a bitter pill to swallow,'' said Sara Seager, an M.I.T. planetary astronomer who works with Kepler. ''We will be faced with hundreds of planet candidates that may never be fully vetted as planets. We just have to live with statistics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But providing statistics, and not pinpointing individual planets, has always been Kepler's prime mission. The road map to new worlds, Dr. Batalha explained, goes like this: First, Kepler figures out how abundant Earths are and how far you have to go out into the universe to find one. That information is needed to design the next step -- a mission that would search the sky for Earth-like planets that are close enough to study. But at 500 to 3,000 light-years away, Kepler's planets are too far for intense direct scrutiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once you know where they are, you study the heck out of them,'' looking for spectral indications of an atmosphere and anything else, including biomarkers that are the signature of living things, Dr. Batalha wrote in an e-mail. ''Everyone and their dog will be looking for biomarkers on these worlds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea for such a mission is a ''starshade'' that would float in front of a telescope in space and cancel out the bright light from a star, allowing its much dimmer planets to stand out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shading a New Telescope</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, some astronomers have proposed building such a starshade for the James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble's successor, which is scheduled to be launched by NASA later this decade. ''It could potentially not only image an Earth-like planet, but provide some information about its atmosphere and surface,'' said David Spergel, an astrophysicist from Princeton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki likes to compare the quest for other worlds to the building of the great cathedrals, a task handed from generation to generation of believers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what if we finally find what we are looking for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that we find lots of Earths just means that we have to spend a lot more money to build the next mission and go and find out if they speak English or French,'' Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we are alone, on the other hand, ''maybe we're going to go conquer the whole galaxy,'' he said. ''Nobody's out there to stop us.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for distant planets starts with the vibrations of their stars, and in those vibrations lies a kind of music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We only know the planet as well as we know the star,'' said Natalie Batalha, an astronomer from San Jose State University who works on NASA's planet-searching satellite Kepler. To that end, Kepler listens to the internal vibrations of stars, gleaning crucial information on their size and structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By speeding up this data and transforming it into sound waves, Kepler's astronomers have produced a sort of iTunes sampler of the cosmos, individual stars banging and whistling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of these are music only the Borg could love,'' said Jon Jenkins, a Kepler data analyst from the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., referring to the cybernetic foes from the ''Star Trek'' series. Dr. Jenkins made the recordings presented here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler monitors the light of 156,000 stars, checking for dips in intensity caused when their planets, if they have any, pass in front of them. It also records high-frequency variations in stars' light caused by vibrations or ''starquakes'' in the stars themselves, from which astronomers practicing the science of asteroseismology can deduce the age and size of the star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By knowing how big the star really is, and the dips in light from the planetary crossings, astronomers can measure the exact size of any planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these audio clips, several weeks' worth of Kepler measurements of a star have been compressed into a few seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 10b is the first rocky planet to be discovered by Kepler. The first audio contains only the vibrations of Kepler 10b's star. The next audio clip has the sound of the planet going by as a ''wump wump wump.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIC1268220 is an eclipsing binary, in which a pair of stars pass in front of each other, producing a bass thumping of eclipses along with a ''whistling forest'' of stellar vibrations, in the words of Dr. Jenkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KIC12253350 is an unusual star. On a graph, its oscillations follow a heart-shaped envelope. The Kepler astrophysicists do not understand why, but they liked it so much that they put the heart-shaped oscillations on a T-shirt with a quotation about the cosmos by Carl Sagan: ''For such small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOULDER, Colo. -- Sitting in a testing facility at the University of Colorado, the inner shell of the Dream Chaser space plane looks like the fuselage of an old DC-3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The test structure has been pushed and pulled to see how it holds up to the stresses and strains of spaceflight. With an additional infusion of money from NASA, the company that makes the Dream Chaser, Sierra Nevada Space Systems, hopes to complete the rest of the structure and eventually take astronauts to orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our view is if we could stop buying from the Russians, if we could make life cheaper for NASA, and if we could build a few vehicles that do other things in low-Earth orbit that are valuable, isn't that, at the end of the day, a good thing?'' said Mark N. Sirangelo, the company's chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dream Chaser is one of several new spacecraft that companies are hoping to launch into space with help from the government. Last year, the Obama administration pushed through an ambitious transformation for NASA: canceling the Ares I rocket, which was to be the successor to the current generation of space shuttles, and turning to the commercial sector for astronaut transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, most of the attention in this new commercial space race has focused on <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which has five decades of experience building spacecraft, and <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> -- <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for short -- a brash upstart that gained credibility last year with two launchings of its Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, led by Elon Musk, a founder of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span> and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, already has a NASA contract for delivering cargo to the space station, and says that it can easily add up to seven seats to its Dragon cargo capsule to make it suitable for passengers. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is also designing a capsule, capable of carrying seven passengers, under the corporate-sounding designation of CST-100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> are not the only competitors seeking to provide space taxi services, a program that NASA calls commercial crew. Last year, in the first-round financing provided for preliminary development, Sierra Nevada Space Systems won the largest award: $20 million out of a total of $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, another space company, <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, announced it had submitted a similar bid for a space plane it wants financed during the second round. NASA is to announce the winners by the end of March, and they will divide $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of NASA's $19 billion budget goes toward human spaceflight -- the space shuttles, the International Space Station -- and $200 million this year is just a small slice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this is indeed the path to do this work, it's probably not what they should be putting into it,'' said Mr. Sirangelo, who is also chairman emeritus of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group. ''But on the other hand, it's a lot more than we had before. And it's an acknowledgment there's momentum in the industry and what we're trying to accomplish. So that's good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the second round, NASA would like narrow its choices down to two, maybe three, systems to finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think this is in effect a one-year race to see who gets the furthest,'' Mr. Sirangelo said, ''and at the end of that, presumably the next two years of the authorization bill gets funded, and then you compete for that pot of money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blueprint for NASA, passed by Congress last year and signed into law by President Obama, calls for spending on commercial crew to rise to $500 million each year in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who was one of the primary architects of the blueprint, as the authorization act was called, has said the intent was to provide $6 billion over six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what Congress puts into the budget could be far less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not getting $6 billion over six years for commercial crew,'' said a Senate aide who was not authorized to speak for attribution. ''That's never going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aide estimated commercial crew might receive half that much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Congress has not passed the final 2011 budget, and Mr. Obama wants to freeze spending at many federal agencies. Whether the freeze includes NASA will not be known until the president's 2012 budget request is released in two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Sierra Nevada has the lowest profile of the companies seeking commercial crew business, it is not new. The parent company, the <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span>, is a privately held defense electronics firm founded in 1963, and a few years ago, it bought several space companies and rolled them into the space systems subsidiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space systems subsidiary, located outside Denver, is the largest manufacturer in the United States of small satellites, Mr. Sirangelo said. The satellites, used for communications and other purposes, cannot do everything that large ones can do, but what they can do, they do more cheaply and more efficiently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dream Chaser embodies the same philosophy. ''There are some tasks that can be done by smaller, cheaper vehicles that used to be done by very expensive vehicles,'' Mr. Sirangelo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sirangelo said the company had invested its own money into the Dream Chaser -- indeed, more than the $20 million that NASA has provided. Over the past year, the company has done a test-firing of the engines it plans to use on the Dream Chaser, and it dropped a scale model of the spacecraft from a helicopter to verify the aerodynamics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is a jump from making spacecraft components and small satellites to building a crew-carrying space plane, and where Sierra Nevada lacks in skills and experience, it has brought in other companies and institutions. Its Dream Chaser partners include Draper Laboratory, which has been designing spacecraft guidance systems since Apollo; NASA's Langley Research Center, which did much of the development that the Dream Chaser is based on; <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which has also worked on space planes; and <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> that builds the Atlas V rocket that the Dream Chaser would ride atop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic, the spacecraft division of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin empire, signed on as a strategic partner in December. Among the possible roles that Virgin could play is selling seats on the Dream Chaser. (Virgin signed a similar agreement with Orbital.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design of the Dream Chaser also has a long lineage, inspired by a Soviet spacecraft. In 1982, an Australian reconnaissance airplane photographed a Russian trawler pulling something with stubby wings out of the Indian Ocean. It turned out to be a test flight of a space plane called the Bor-4, and the craft captured enough curiosity that engineers at NASA Langley copied it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA called its version the HL-20, and for a while in 1991, it looked to be the low-cost choice for taking astronauts to and from the space station. Then the NASA administrator who liked it, Vice Adm. Richard Truly of the Navy, left, and the man who replaced him, Daniel S. Goldin, thought it was not cheap enough and ended the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dream Chaser design keeps the exact outer shape from the HL-20 -- a decision that allows Sierra Nevada to take advantage of years of wind tunnel tests that Langley had performed -- while modifying the design within. The biggest change is the addition of two engines, which reduces the number of passengers to seven from 10, but adds maneuverability. To finish developing the Dream Chaser would require less than $1 billion, Mr. Sirangelo said, and it could be ready to fly an orbital test flight in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He imagines that one flight could combine a number of tasks -- taking astronauts to the space station and then stopping on the return trip to repair or refuel a satellite. ''This vehicle is perfectly designed to do all that,'' Mr. Sirangelo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> -- a company in Dulles, Va., that builds and launches rockets and satellites for everything from television broadcasts to scientific research -- say they are excited by the possibilities of commercial crew, but they are more cautious. Orbital, founded in 1982, was a survivor from the last boom-and-bust in commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its space plane design is a refinement of the HL-20. Following in the pattern of tapping Greek mythology for the names of its spacecraft, Orbital calls its plane Prometheus. Orbital says development of Prometheus would cost $3.5 billion to $4 billion, which would include the cost of upgrading the Atlas V rocket and two test flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With enough financial support, David W. Thompson, chief executive of Orbital, is sure that his company can build and operate Prometheus. But he is less sure that his industry is at a tipping point for spaceflight to become much more common, driving down prices and opening up space to new businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it depends on what the demand curve really is,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''I would say I'm highly skeptical.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the emerging role of private businesses in NASA's spaceflight program misstated the number of passengers a crew capsule in development at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> would be capable of carrying.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Scott Kelly got word from Mission Control on Jan. 8 that the head of the astronaut office wanted to talk with him directly on a private line, he recalled, ''I knew whatever it was, it wasn't good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Kelly, who was orbiting the Earth on the International Space Station, knew that private calls from the brass were rare, and that they were rarely about happy things. What he did not know was that his sister-in-law, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, had just been shot in Tucson, and that his twin brother, a fellow astronaut, Mark Kelly, was racing to her side from Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peggy A. Whitson, the chief of the astronaut office, delivered the difficult message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the station crew had been watching CNN off and on during the day -- it was a Saturday, when housekeeping and other official duties tend to be light -- the feed had been cut off shortly before the call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I told her I'd like as much information as the news is putting out, even if it's unconfirmed,'' he said. Soon, CNN was back on, and Commander Kelly was able to monitor the news as it was being reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commander Kelly, who is a captain in the Navy, discussed the events in two interviews from space on Wednesday morning with The Associated Press and The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making calls from space, the ultimate in long-distance dialing, is easier than it has ever been, with direct calls possible whenever certain microwave radio signals are available to the station, so astronauts need not be isolated in times of crisis. With e-mail and Internet access, Commander Kelly said, he has been able to speak with his brother often -- ''I did talk to him today,'' he said -- along with family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giffords is now in a rehabilitation program in Houston; Mark Kelly issued a message to his 28,000 followers on Twitter that ''Today was a huge day for GG. Lots of progress!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Kelly, also a Navy captain, is now determining, with NASA officials, whether he will lead his scheduled mission to the space station in April. Scott Kelly, who would be back on Earth by the time his brother would get to the station, declined to provide additional details on his sister-in-law's progress or to discuss his brother's decision, aside from saying that ''I'm pretty sure I know which way he's leaning,'' and that ''I think we'll hear something about that soon.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASTRONOMERS announced last month that, contrary to previous assumptions, the orbiting body Eris might be smaller than Pluto after all. Since it was the discovery in 2005 of Eris, an object seemingly larger than what had been considered our smallest planet, that precipitated the downgrading of Pluto from full planet to ''dwarf,'' some think it may be time to revisit Pluto's status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of us can't help rooting for Pluto. We liked the idea of a ninth planet, hanging out there like a period at the end of the gorgeous sentence of the solar system. It gave us a sense of completeness. And besides, we were used to it. Pluto's demotion caused such an outcry because it altered something we thought we knew to be true about our world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, science doesn't, and shouldn't, care what we learned in first grade. If Pluto's odyssey teaches us anything, it's that whenever we think we've discovered a measure of certainty about the universe, it's often fleeting, and more often pure dumb luck. The 1930 discovery of Pluto -- by Clyde Tombaugh, who coincidentally was born 105 years ago today -- is a prime example, a testament not only to Tombaugh's remarkable perseverance, but also to how a stupendously unlikely run of circumstances can lead to scientific glory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for a ninth planet was led by the Harvard-trained Percival Lowell, a Boston Brahmin who was widely known for announcing the existence of a Martian civilization. Lowell's hypotheses about a ''Planet X'' were based on optimistic interpretations of inconclusive data. Many had observed that the orbit of Uranus seemed to be perturbed by a gravitational influence beyond the orbit of Neptune. If the source of that pull could be determined, he speculated, a fellow could point a telescope at that source and find an undiscovered world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Lowell, in the Arizona observatory he had built, set out to do just that. His method was not without precedent. But in 1916, after more than a decade of exquisitely delicate mathematics and erratic searching, Lowell died, his reputation as a gifted crackpot confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen years later, Clyde Tombaugh was hired by V. M. Slipher, the director of the Lowell Observatory, to resume the search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 22, Tombaugh had been making his own telescopes for years in a root cellar on his father's Kansas farm (where the air was cool and still enough to allow for the correction of microscopic flaws in the mirrors he polished by hand). The resulting telescopes were of such high quality that Tombaugh could draw the bands of weather on Jupiter, 400 million miles away. Ambitious but too poor to afford college, Tombaugh had written at random to Slipher, seeking career advice. Slipher took a look at the drawings that Tombaugh had included, and invited him to Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, Tombaugh used a device called a blink comparator to pore over scores of photographic plates, hunting for one moving pinprick amid millions of stars. When he finally found the moving speck in February 1930, it was very nearly where Lowell's mathematics had predicted it would be. Headlines proclaimed Lowell's predictions confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was something strange about the object. It soon became apparent that it was much too small to have exerted any effect on Uranus's orbit. Astronomers then assumed it had to be a moon, with a larger planet nearby. But despite more searching, no larger object came to light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They eventually had to face the fact that the discovery of a new object so near Lowell's predicted location was nothing more than a confounding coincidence. Tombaugh's object, soon christened Pluto, wasn't Planet X. Instead of an example of good old American vision and know-how, the discovery was the incredibly fluky result of a baseless dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades later, this was proved doubly true. Data from the 1989 Voyager 2 flyby showed that the mass of Neptune had been inaccurately measured by about 0.5 percent all along, and that, in fact, the orbit of Uranus had never been inexplicably disturbed to begin with. Percival Lowell had been hunting a ghost. And Clyde Tombaugh, against all odds, had found one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which is to say, science is imperfect. It is a human enterprise, subject to passions and whims, accidents and luck. Astronomers have since discovered dozens of other objects in our solar system approaching Pluto's size, amounting to a whole separate class of orbiting bodies. And just this week, researchers announced that they had identified 1,235 possible planets in other star systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can mourn the demotion of our favorite planet. But the best way to honor Lowell and Tombaugh is to celebrate the fact that Pluto -- while never quite the world it was predicted to be -- is part of a universe more complex, varied and surprising than even its discoverers could have imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, for those of us who grew up chanting ''My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us New Pizza,'' nine planets will always seem more fitting than eight. New facts are unsettling. But with the right mindset, the new glories can more than make up for the loss of the old.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the continuing real-life drama that surpasses the most audacious soap opera narrative, the astronaut Mark E. Kelly announced Friday that he would honor his commitment to lead a two-week shuttle mission to the International Space Station -- 200 miles up, and orbiting the earth at 17,500 miles an hour -- while his wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, continues her gradual, uncertain recovery from the grievous head wound she suffered during last month's deadly rampage by a gunman in Tucson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appearing at a news conference in Houston, his face conveying the twinning of anxiety and resolve, Captain Kelly, of the Navy, laid out the thought process behind his choice: ''Considering a bunch of other factors, including what Gabrielle would want me to do, and what her parents and her family and my family would like, I ultimately made the decision that I would like to return and command S.T.S. 134'' -- Space Transportation System 134, NASA's official name for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the commander, who in the past has said that his wife can understand him, repeatedly declined to say whether Ms. Giffords helped him to reach his decision, or whether she was even aware of the decision. Instead, more than once, he expressed confidence that he had her support. ''I know my wife very well, and I know what she would want,'' the commander said. ''And that makes the decision easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That decision marked the latest breathtaking turn in a marriage between two accomplished people that through the intrusion of tragedy has become part of the public domain. They have become the nation's couple, this wounded congresswoman and this duty-bound astronaut, in ways that transcend their shared commitment to public service -- so much so that many turned to the Internet to suggest what was best for this husband and wife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should he stay by his wife's side? Or should he lead the mission he had trained for well more than a year to lead? Is it bullheaded of him to go on such a risky business trip? Or is this what she wants him to do, expects him to do? And how does a two-week trip to space compare to a yearlong tour in Afghanistan by soldiers with complicated domestic situations of their own?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though a few criticized Captain Kelly's decision -- saying his duty was to be at his wife's side, not in space -- the consensus appeared to be that the astronaut had made the correct and courageous move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I imagine a woman of strength and character such as hers wouldn't have wanted it any other way,'' wrote Joellelevand on Jezebel, a pop-culture blog geared to women. And on the NASAWatch blog, Jsonova99 wrote, ''He's a pro and I have no doubt he'll bring his A game to the mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in the real and not virtual world, the congresswoman's staff members were elated with the commander's announcement. ''We all were kind of hoping this would be the decision he would make,'' said Pia Carusone, the chief of staff for Ms. Giffords. ''There's no doubt in anyone's mind that this is what Gabby would want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some people questioned the choice. ''The truly courageous and strong thing to do is to be an accessible partner to your disabled wife who is now relearning almost every function of her body and intellect,'' one reader wrote to The New York Times Web site. ''Just sayin'.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about his ''just sayin' '' critics, Captain Kelly said that many people do not know what the Giffords and Kelly families know about Ms. Giffords's condition, her support system and her admiration for the space mission. ''I think if they had more details about those things, you'd probably have less people being critical,'' said the astronaut, who wore a blue wristband decorated with a peace sign, a heart sign and the name ''Gabby.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the shooting rampage on Jan. 8, which killed 6 people and wounded 13, including Ms. Giffords, the nation has followed the congresswoman's wrenching journey from the blood-stained pavement in Tucson to a rehabilitation hospital in Houston, as well as that of her husband. The country has also come to know the story of their romance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Giffords, 40, grew up in Tucson, amid cottonwood trees, while Mr. Kelly, 46, grew up in West Orange, N.J., within sight of the Manhattan cityscape. She rode horses; he fought and competed with his twin brother, Scott, who is also a NASA commander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was married and she was dating someone else when they met on a trip to China in 2003. Finding that they shared much in common -- including love for exercise and the outdoors -- they married four years later. Since then they have juggled high-pressure job commitments and long distances; he lives in Houston, where he has two daughters, and she lives in Arizona and in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the shooting in Tucson, and an awful telephone call to Captain Kelly in Houston, and a brief period when he had to process news reports, quickly retracted, that his wife had died. All of this was less than a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Captain Kelly recalled sitting at his wife's bedside in Tucson, discussing her prognosis with her neurosurgeon and her trauma surgeon. ''At the time, my thought was that I very likely would be sitting in that same seat maybe two, four, six months later -- in that I.C.U., by her bedside,'' he said. In other words, he would not be able to command the space-shuttle mission in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the congresswoman's condition quickly improved, against strong odds, warranting a transfer to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, where she could begin her rehabilitation. Her days are booked from 8 in the morning until after 6 at night, with a full schedule posted on her private room's door: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, meals, much-needed rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her daily commitments played a vital role in his decision-making, the astronaut said. He began to weigh the amount of time he could spend with her against what was in the best interests of NASA and his crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's made progress every day,'' he said, though, again, without providing specifics. ''So about two weeks ago, I started going through the process myself of what would I need in order to get back with my crew to continue training for S.T.S. 134'' -- training that began 18 months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an evaluation of the situation, NASA officials decided that Captain Kelly would go into space. He is scheduled to lead a six-member crew on a two-week trip to the International Space Station on the space shuttleEndeavour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In what will be the second-to-last shuttle flight to the station before the 30-year-old program ends, the crew will be ferrying up a major scientific instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The $1.5 billion, 8-ton device will peer into the cosmos to detect dark matter, the invisible stuff that may act as cosmic glue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Kelly acknowledged that space flight is a ''risky business'' -- but so, too, is being a member of Congress. He said he weighed these risks, along with his wife's daily demands, the support she has, his responsibility to his crew and his country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel very confident that I made the right decision,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others agree, and have spoken up for Ms. Giffords. For example, Elaine Richardson, a longtime friend of Ms. Giffords who was a bridesmaid at her wedding to Mr. Kelly, said she was thrilled that he decided to go to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Knowing Gabby, she would want him to go up,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''It's an important mission for the country and for him personally. And if he decided not to go, 10 years from now they would both realize it was an opportunity missed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, then, the astronaut trained for his upcoming journey, while the congresswoman continued on her own. Then, at night, she returned to her private hospital room, where the walls are festooned with get-well cards from children and enlarged photographs of Gabby and Mark, hiking in the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Case to Go First</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUCSON -- Jared L. Loughner will not face state murder charges in the Tucson shooting rampage until after the federal government finishes its trial against him, the authorities said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Loughner faces three federal charges of attempted murder in the wounding of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and two of her aides here on Jan. 8; additional federal charges are expected. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: February 12, 2011, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, a picture caption last Saturday with an article about Mark E. Kelly's decision to proceed with a space shuttle mission while his wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, continues her recovery from injuries sustained in a shooting last month in Tucson referred incorrectly to his previous missions. Mr. Kelly was the commander of a flight by the space shuttle Discovery in 2008; he did not command a mission with the space shuttle Endeavour last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that long ago, the possibility of finding planets outside our solar system was merely theoretical. In 1995, astronomers began to be able to detect Jupiter-sized ''exoplanets'' by their gravitational effect on the stars they orbit. And with the launch of the Kepler satellite in March 2009 and the release last week of the data it has so far gathered, astronomy has crossed a major threshold. The Kepler has discovered 1,235 potential planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this so striking is the satellite's instruments always point at the same tiny arc of the Milky Way near the constellation called the Northern Cross -- only one four-hundredth of the sky. The Kepler team leader, William Borucki, at the Ames Research Center in Northern California, says that if Kepler could see the whole sky, it would have found some 400,000 planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite detects possible planets by measuring the light of 156,000 stars in its field of view and looking for slight dips in brightness when a planet crosses in front of a star. All of these planets will have to be validated using telescopes. That will take years, given the limited number of astronomers and powerful telescopes on this planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are any of the Kepler's planets another Earth? Fifty-four of them look as if they might be the right size and the right distance from their stars to be in a habitable zone, where liquid water can exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As exciting as the Kepler results are, they are also a reminder of how fictional science fiction -- with its multiplicity of worlds and easy interstellar travel -- really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we launched ourselves today toward the nearest planetary system discovered so far -- at speeds we can already conceivably travel in space -- we would have 300,000 years of asking ''when will we get there?'' before we got there.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">At Martian North Pole, Dunes That Shift and Slide</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dark basalt sand dunes around the edge of Mars' North Pole are approximately the size of Texas and stand more than 100 feet high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dunes were long thought to be stagnant formations, but high-resolution images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter now reveal that the dunes are among the most active landscapes on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just did not have the tools to see what was happening,'' said Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, lead author of a study in Science. ''Now we're able to take pictures and see things that only have subtle differences in contrast, and that's what has really enabled us to see the changes on the dunes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers studied hundreds of images over the period of two Martian years, or four Earth years. During the winter months, a blanket of dry ice covers the dunes and destabilizes the sand, Dr. Hansen said. As a result, the sand moves, causing avalanches and creating new alcoves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the images the scientists have looked at, about 40 percent of the dunes seem to have gone through some modification over the two Martian years. In certain spots, hundreds of cubic yards of sand had come down the face of the dunes in avalanches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If their funding continues, the team plans to keep observing changes in the dunes, since the Reconnaissance Orbiter has enough fuel to stay in orbit until 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People don't tend to think of Mars as being geologically active today, and that's what's these images are showing us,'' Dr. Hansen said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>521 words</div><div>8 February 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a canceled, over-budget NASA rocket, stack a workhorse European satellite launcher on top of it, and the result could be a powerful, low-cost alternative for taking people to space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the plan of <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span> of Minneapolis -- the aerospace company more commonly known as ATK, which manufacturers the solid rocket motors for NASA's space shuttles -- and Astrium, a European company that builds Ariane 5 rockets, which are used to launch satellites. The two will announce on Tuesday what is essentially a commercial version of the Ares I, the expensive NASA rocket that Congress and the Obama administration canceled last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I, part of a bloated NASA program to send astronauts back to the moon, could become a success story in the Obama administration's effort to shape a more affordable space program with the help of the private sector. NASA's so-called commercial crew program is seeking companies to build and operate space taxis to take astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rocket, named Liberty, would be much cheaper than the Ares I, because the unfinished NASA-designed upper stage of the Ares I would be replaced with the first stage of the Ariane 5, which has been launched successfully 41 consecutive times. The lower stage of the Liberty, a longer version of the shuttle booster built by ATK, would be almost unchanged from the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the companies competing for NASA's space taxi business, like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and the <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences Corporation</span>, are looking at using a low-end version of the Atlas V rocket built by the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>. ATK hopes the Liberty can take business away from the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> with a greater lift capability (44,500 pounds to low-Earth orbit) at a cost (less than $180 million) it says is lower than that of the Atlas V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Liberty could also solve other issues. Launching from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, it would generate about 300 jobs and make use of facilities that might otherwise sit idle after the space shuttles are retired this year. The Atlas V launches from the neighboring Cape Canaveral Air Force station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK is seeking part of $200 million that NASA will distribute next month for commercial crew efforts. The Liberty's first test launching could take place in 2013, and it could be ready to carry astronauts two years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK and Astrium also hope the rocket can compete for future contracts for space station cargo. With an eventual four to six launchings a year, the Liberty could also help reduce the cost of the heavy-lift rocket that NASA is to develop for deep-space missions. The current design of the heavy-lift calls for the same solid rocket motors as the Liberty.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time NASA visited the Tempel 1 comet, it was with fireworks, on July 4, 2005. On that day, the Deep Impact spacecraft slammed an 820-pound projectile into Tempel 1, excavating a plume of ice and dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday night -- Valentine's Day -- NASA will return to Tempel 1 but will not bombard it. This time, a different spacecraft, Stardust, will zip past at more than 24,000 miles per hour, taking 72 high-resolution pictures of the comet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust will make its closest approach, within 125 miles, at 11:37 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Larson, the mission's project manager, said NASA was not deliberately scheduling its missions to coincide with holidays. ''That's just how the orbital mechanics worked out on these,'' he said, ''although it makes for great P.R.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tempel 1 will be the first comet to be seen at close range twice, and scientists will make a then-and-now comparison -- one that they expect will reveal a change in topography and tell them more about the inner workings of comets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here's a chance where we can see what has changed, how much has changed,'' said Joseph Veverka, a professor of astronomy at Cornell and the mission's principal investigator, ''so we'll start unraveling the history of a comet's surface.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, photographs taken by Deep Impact in 2005 showed areas that looked old and others that seemed much younger. But the snapshots did not tell the ages of any of them. ''We have no idea whether we're talking about things that have been there for a hundred years, a thousand years, a million years,'' Dr. Veverka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the five and a half years since Deep Impact's visit, Tempel 1 -- whose orbit brings it as close to the Sun as Mars and as far away as Jupiter -- has completed a full orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stardust was launched in 1999 and arrived five years later at its primary destination, a comet named Wild 2, where it collected particles of dust. Stardust then looped back to Earth and released a canister containing the comet dust, which parachuted back to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft, still operating well, continued onward, and NASA decided to use it for a return visit to Tempel 1. (Deep Impact, meanwhile, also extended its scientific journey, visiting another comet last November.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One more puzzle that scientists may be able to solve with the second look at Tempel 1 involves depressions that look like the type of craters caused by impacts. The depressions, though, could have been caused by explosions that were a result of underground ice that converted to gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists will now be able to compare the depressions with something they know is definitely a crater -- the scar left by Deep Impact. ''Simple question,'' Dr. Veverka said, ''direct answer.''</p>
