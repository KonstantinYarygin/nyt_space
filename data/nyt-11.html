<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- Three Chinese astronauts returned safely to earth in their space capsule late Sunday afternoon after spending nearly three days in low orbit and completing the nation's first spacewalk, Chinese state television said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The re-entry capsule of the Shenzhou VII spacecraft floated down by parachute and landed on the grasslands of northern China at 5:37 p.m. Beijing time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capsule was located about 10 minutes later by a search-and-rescue team, which helped the three astronauts climb out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landing was shown on national television and the three astronauts appeared relatively well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After emerging from a cramped, round capsule, they sat on what looked like lawn chairs, waved to the cameras and spoke briefly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a glorious mission, full of challenges, but the result is perfect,'' one of the astronauts, Zhai Zhigang, said after the landing, according to the state-run news media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Zhai completed the nation's first spacewalk, floating above an orbital module and waving a small Chinese flag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China called the mission, its third manned space launch, a complete success and a ''major breakthrough'' for the country's space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has said it hopes to establish a space station and eventually make a moon landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing sees the space program as a major yardstick of the country's economic and technological development, and also a means to strengthening the country's image at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, which has spent billions of dollars building up its space program over the past decade, is only the third country, after Russia and the United States, to send humans into space with its own spaceship.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A privately financed company launched a rocket of its own design successfully into orbit on Sunday night, ushering in what the company's founders hope will be a new era of spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the fourth launching attempt by the company, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, which was founded by Elon Musk, an Internet entrepreneur born in South Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've made orbit!'' Mr. Musk exclaimed to his employees at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., proclaiming the moment ''awesome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were a lot of people who thought we couldn't do it -- a lot, actually,'' he said after thanking his employees. ''But, you know, the saying goes, fourth time's the charm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk, 37, founded <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> in 2002 after selling the online payment company he helped found, PayPal, to <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which has more than 500 employees, captured one of the most coveted prizes of the new space industry: a commercial orbital transportation services contract worth as much as $100 million. Known by its acronym, Cots, the program encourages private-sector alternatives to the space shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is developing a larger rocket, the Falcon 9, to provide cargo services to the International Space Station for NASA after the shuttle program winds down in 2010. The company also hopes to adapt its technology to carry people to the station, which could help bridge the gap until the debut of the next generation of NASA spacecraft, planned for 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is just the first step in many,'' Mr. Musk told his team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His relief was obvious. The first three efforts by <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> had ended in failure. The first, in March 2006, failed about a minute into the ascent because of a fuel line leak. A second rocket, launched in March 2007, made it to space but was lost about five minutes after launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the most recent flight, on Aug. 2, mission control lost contact with the craft shortly after the separation of the first stage. That third flight carried three small satellites for NASA and the Defense Department, as well as small amounts of the cremated remains of 200 people, including Gordon Cooper, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, and James Doohan, who played the character Montgomery Scott on the original ''Star Trek'' television series.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers identified the problem as a small amount of residual thrust from the first stage after the engine was cut off; the first stage rear-ended the second after separation. Mr. Musk said the company had fixed the problem by telling the rocket to wait a few more seconds after cut-off before jettisoning the first stage, a change that required rewriting a single line of computer code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> took no chances with a customer's payload and instead launched what it called a payload mass simulator -- a 364-pound weight -- from the Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean at 7:16 p.m., Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those at headquarters cheered lustily at the launching, and even more so when the first and second stages separated successfully on live video that was also shown on the company's Web site, spacex.com. There was a long moment of concern as mission control lost contact with the craft as it neared orbital velocity, its engine nozzle glowing bright red. But the image reappeared, and the cheers resumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news conference after the launching, Mr. Musk told reporters, ''It's great to have this giant monkey off my back.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crew of seven astronauts was scheduled to blast off in the shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 14 for an 11-day visit to the telescope, which for 18 years has been beaming cosmic postcards to Earth from its orbital vantage point above the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During five spacewalks, the astronauts were set to install two new instruments and repair the telescope's best camera and a spectrograph, both of which had electrical failures. They were also scheduled to replace the telescope's batteries and gyroscopes, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Saturday, a channel on a control system known as the Hubble Control Unit/Science Data Formatter -- which helps relay data to the ground -- failed, causing the telescope to go into a ''safe mode'' and cease observations. Hubble's managers expect that activating a backup channel will restore the telescope to service later this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that will leave the telescope with no backup if the new channel stops working, so NASA would like to have the astronauts replace the failed control unit with a spare from the Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone news conference with reporters on Monday evening, Preston Burch of Goddard, Hubble's program manager, said the control unit hangs, attached by 10 bolts, on the inside door of a bay that the astronauts can access easily. With luck, it could be exchanged during a two-hour spacewalk, he said. ''We think it's a relatively straightforward activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too soon to tell, the mission managers said, whether replacing the control unit will bump another activity from the servicing schedule. The mission's five spacewalks are tightly packed with activities, but the lead astronaut, John M. Grunsfeld, has been able in training to complete the camera repair in one spacewalk instead of the scheduled two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This may be a doable thing, that we can have our cake and eat it too,'' Mr. Burch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understanding what went wrong, testing the spare unit, integrating its installation into the mission schedule and training the crew to install it will take several weeks or more, Mr. Burch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble mission cannot be launched until another shuttle, the Discovery, which is scheduled for a Feb. 12 trip to the space station, is ready to serve as the backup rescue shuttle. As a result, the flight will not take place before February 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA Phoenix spacecraft has discovered two minerals on Mars that suggest water was there in the past. Scientists reported that the minerals -- calcium carbonate and sheet silicate -- do not usually form without the presence of liquid water. The Phoenix landed in the Martian arctic plains in May on a three-month mission to study whether the environment could be friendly to microbial life. One of its main goals is to probe whether the ice ever melted. NASA recently extended the mission through the end of the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In arid lands where the sightlines are long, you often see a band of rain falling and evaporating before it reaches the ground. That is a virga. It looks like a dark, slanting smudge between the clouds and the horizon. On Mars, an arid planet, NASA's Phoenix Mars lander has spotted a snow virga. Shining a green laser straight up toward a layer of clouds, the lander detected crystals of ice swirling above the planet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a scientific scene ready for recasting in the form of a snow globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These Martian snows are the sign of impending winter, a season that will bring increasing darkness and temperatures around 200 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. The darkness will keep the solar panels from recharging the lander, and the deep cold will crack the array, likely shutting the vehicle down for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Phoenix lander -- the first to explore one of the planet's polar regions -- has had a remarkable run since it reached the northern plains of Mars on May 25. It has not detected direct evidence of life, but it has found subsurface ice and other chemical traces of the former presence of water, a prerequisite for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is NASA's sixth successful landing on Mars. It's hard to imagine a small machine packed with more tools than the Phoenix. Since late May, it has been conducting experiments of many kinds, analyzing soil samples, probing the atmosphere, studying the history of water on the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is still surprising is the visceral immediacy of the landers' ground-level view of the harsh Martian geology. To that stark landscape, we now get to add the thought of snow falling in the polar night.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STAR CITY, Russia -- This place was once no place, a secret military base northeast of Moscow that did not show up on maps. The Soviet Union trained its astronauts here to fight on the highest battlefield of the cold war: space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet these days, Star City is the place for America's hard-won orbital partnership with Russia, where astronauts train to fly aboard Soyuz spacecraft. And in two years Star City will be the only place to send astronauts from any nation to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap is coming: from 2010, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shuts down the space shuttle program, to 2015, when the next generation of American spacecraft is scheduled to arrive, NASA expects to have no human flight capacity and will depend on Russia to get to the $100 billion station, buying seats on Soyuz craft as space tourists do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As NASA celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, the time lag in the Bush administration's plan to retire the nation's three space shuttles and work on a return to the Moon has thrust the United States space program squarely into national politics and geopolitical controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have denounced the gap and promoted their commitment to the space program while on trips to Florida, where thousands of workers will lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends. And antagonism between the United States and Russia, over the conflict in Georgia and other issues, is clouding the future of a 15-year partnership in space, precisely when NASA will be more reliant on Russia than ever before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administrator of NASA, Michael D. Griffin, has called the situation ''unseemly in the extreme.'' In an e-mail message he sent to his top advisers in August, Dr. Griffin wrote that ''events have unfolded in a way that makes it clear how unwise it was for the U.S. to adopt a policy of deliberate dependence on another power.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin is worried enough that he ordered his staff to explore flying the aging shuttles past 2010. He did so, he said in an interview last month, ''about five minutes after the Russians invaded Georgia, because I could see this coming.'' But he warned that any extension would be costly and could further delay NASA's return to the Moon and threaten America's role as the leading space power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's Gains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, China made the third successful launching of its Shenzhou VII spacecraft and the first spacewalk by one of its astronauts. The Chinese government has said it hopes to establish a space station and eventually make a Moon landing. The United States plans to return to the Moon by 2020 at the earliest; some observers believe China might get there first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interruption in American-controlled access to space rankles some in Washington, including Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a leading proponent of the space program. In an interview, Mr. Nelson said it was ''inexcusable'' for the country's space program to be put in a position of dependence on such a politically volatile partner. ''We've got a Russian prime minister who believes he's czar,'' he said of Vladimir Putin, referring to Russia's military action in Georgia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has had periods in which its astronauts could not reach space: from the end of the Apollo program in 1975 to the beginning of shuttle flights in 1981, and for more than two years after the loss of the shuttles Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. But the coming interval could be the longest if the rollout of NASA's new rockets is significantly delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the outlines of the gap have been known since soon after Dr. Griffin began running the agency in 2005, Cmdr. Scott J. Kelly of the Navy, an astronaut who has made two trips to orbit, warned in April that the prospect of a United States that could not send humans into space on its own rockets would come as a shock. ''A large part of the American public is going to be surprised,'' he said, adding that people would cry, ''Who let that happen?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Politics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bush administration chose to give up the nation's own access to space for five years and move to the next phase of space travel. The administration decided to retire the shuttles and in January 2004 announced a sweeping ''vision for space exploration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, NASA would stop using the aging and risky shuttle fleet and move to a new launching program, Constellation, built around Ares rockets and Orion capsules that are designed to return astronauts to the Moon and even to explore near-Earth asteroids and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get from one program to the other without inflating NASA's $17 billion annual budget, the administration decided to wind down the shuttle program and ramp up Constellation. The decision has always been portrayed as difficult, but in recent months, criticism has flared. The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, for example, have pledged to keep America flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As president, I will act to ensure our astronauts will continue to explore space, and not just by hitching a ride with someone else,'' Mr. McCain said in a statement this year. Mr. Obama has criticized what he has called the ''poor planning and inadequate funding'' that have led to the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both candidates say NASA should explore the continuation of the shuttle program for at least one additional flight and try to speed up the development of Constellation with more financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any new money, though, would come too late to greatly shorten the development time for the new craft. ''It is essentially unfixable now,'' Dr. Griffin said. His growing frustration was clear in his e-mail message to aides on Aug. 18, which included the order to study the additional flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a rational world, we would have been allowed to pick a shuttle retirement date to be consistent with Ares/Orion availability,'' Dr. Griffin wrote. Within the administration, he wrote, ''retiring the shuttle is a jihad rather than an engineering and program management decision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the message was published by The Orlando Sentinel, Dr. Griffin issued a statement saying his message had failed ''to provide the contextual framework for my remarks, and my support for the administration's policies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, legislation vital to NASA's gap plans -- permission by Congress to buy Soyuz seats after 2011 -- was stalled by the furor over the Russian action in Georgia. That problem was resolved last month when Congress quietly granted approval, but the broader issues presented by the gap remain. And Dr. Griffin's concerns do not end with Russia and Washington politics. He has repeatedly warned that China's space program is moving forward rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony to the Senate last year, Dr. Griffin said it was likely that ''China will be able to put people on the Moon before we will be able to get back.'' That prospect concerns Representative Tom Feeney, Republican of Florida. A fellow congressman recently suggested naming the first new lunar base after Neil Armstrong. Mr. Feeney recalled responding, ''What makes you think the Chinese are going to give us permission to name their base after one of our astronauts?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Partnership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing tension with Russia complicates a longstanding international alliance in space that helped defuse the cold war, especially among those who had served at the front lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William M. Shepherd, the first commander of the station and a former member of the Navy Seals, recalled that when he and his crewmate Yuri Gidzenko first orbited the Earth, the two cold warriors pointed to bases where, years before, they had trained and waited on alert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I realized at that moment we were not an American and a Russian any more,'' Mr. Shepherd said.'' ''It was about something that transcended that whole canvas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership began in the 1990s, as the Soviet Union and its economy collapsed and Russian knowledge about carrying people into orbit -- or bombs to distant destinations -- was at risk of falling into the hands of hostile nations. In paying to help keep the Russian space program going, the logic went, the United States would limit arms proliferation. By the mid-1990s Americans began serving aboard the Mir space station as the United States and Russia planned what would become the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The early days were marked by wariness. Mark Bowman, an early contract employee in Russia who is now back in Moscow as a NASA representative, said that Korolev, where mission control is, ''was a closed city'' when he arrived in 1993. ''Foreigners were not allowed here,'' Mr. Bowman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, teams of NASA workers live year round in Russia and dozens of others come through for training runs, launchings and landings. ''I'd venture to say the people who work at NASA know the Russians better than any other branch of our government,'' Commander Kelly, the astronaut, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Eisenhower, an expert on United States-Russia relations and the space programs, said the Russians proved after the loss of the shuttle Columbia that they would hold up their end of the bargain by continuing to take Americans to the station. ''When we had no choice because of the shuttle failure the Russian could have blackmailed us around this tragedy and did not do so,'' Ms. Eisenhower said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vitaly Davidov, the deputy director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said in an interview at mission control that Russia would honor its commitments to fly crews to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not mean the going will be easy. The United States and Russia are at loggerheads over many trade and political issues. But Michael Krepon, who helped found the Henry L. Stimson Center, a policy institute, said that while the Russian space monopoly created risk, ''there is a longstanding etiquette: you do not mess with the safety of humans in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think this is going to get very ugly if the gap problem continues,'' Mr. Krepon said. ''But it will become expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Long Countdown: This is the first in an occasional series examining the five years between when NASA shuts down the space shuttle program and when the next generation of American spacecraft is scheduled to arrive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's next big mission is ambitious, perhaps too ambitious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to send a robotic rover the size of a small S.U.V. to Mars. The rover, called the Mars Science Laboratory, would be powered by a nuclear battery and be able to roam far and wide, gathering information with a suite of powerful instruments, including a laser to vaporize rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is in charge of building the spacecraft, now believes it needs perhaps an additional $100 million, on top of previous budget increases, to meet the current schedule of launching in September or October next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its overall budget tight, NASA has no easy choices. It could keep the current timeline, making up the budget shortfall by delaying or canceling other planetary missions. Or it could delay the Mars Science Laboratory by one or two years, which would ease the short-term budget strain but, the agency says, ultimately add $300 million or more to the price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or NASA could decide that enough is enough and cancel the mission. That, however, would waste the $1.5 billion already spent on it and deflate the agency's Mars exploration program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decision could come as soon as Friday, when officials from NASA's science mission directorate meet with the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin. A news conference on the mission is planned for Friday afternoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are going to be some recommendations to him about what should be done,'' though Dr. Griffin may not immediately decide the mission's fate, said Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the latest financial snag, the mission had gone over cost by at least $200 million, raising the total to $1.7 billion, and NASA had been forced to juggle its finances for this year to cover overruns in the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cupboard is kind of bare now,'' said Sean C. Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, chairman of the planetary science subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council. ''And to come up with $100 million-plus gets really, really challenging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week NASA officials gave an update on the Mars Science Laboratory to the subcommittee, which provides feedback from scientists to NASA in the planning of planetary missions. The officials, Dr. Solomon said, did not give details of why the mission's costs had swelled again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Science Laboratory aims high, both in its technological requirements and in its science goals. It would weigh about 1,800 pounds, or more than four times as much as either the Opportunity or Spirit rover, both currently on Mars. Pellets of decaying plutonium rather than solar panels would provide sufficient power for larger and more sophisticated instruments in its 140-pound scientific payload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the laboratory is too big and heavy to employ the bouncing cocoon of airbags that cushioned the landings of Spirit and Opportunity. Instead, engineers devised a completely new landing scheme. After parachutes slow the spacecraft's descent through the atmosphere, rocket thrusters are to fire, enabling the craft to slow to a stop and hover in midair. The rover would then be lowered via a winch to the surface. (The hovering part of the spacecraft would fly away and crash.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his presentation to the planetary science subcommittee, James L. Green, director of NASA's planetary science division, said that to make up for the new overrun, the agency could delay or cancel missions like Grail and Ladee, which are to visit the Moon, or Juno, a return to Jupiter and its moons. But such a step could start a domino effect that would disrupt the entire solar system program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is to delay the Mars Science Laboratory's launching by a year and then park the spacecraft in orbit around the Sun for a year, until Mars and Earth are again in close alignment. That option, in which the craft would arrive at Mars two years later than planned, would add $300 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another option -- adding tens of millions of dollars beyond that one, Dr. Green said in his presentation -- would be a two-year delay in launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Solomon said there was no support on his subcommittee for the most drastic choice: cancellation. ''We didn't think it was a good use of NASA's funds invested already,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another member of the subcommittee, Kip V. Hodges, a professor of earth and space exploration at Arizona State University, said: ''One of the things they wanted our opinion on is, is this a critically important mission? And the answer to that is absolutely yes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Hodges also wondered what opportunities might be lost to the Mars Science Laboratory's growing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At some time,'' he said, ''when you're on fixed income, you have to think how far you can go even if it's an excellent mission.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite another overrun that could push its cost to more than $2 billion, NASA's next-generation Mars rover mission remains on track for launching next fall, NASA officials said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are going quite well technically,'' Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters, said in a telephone news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of delays in some components like motors to move the rover's joints, additional staffing and resources were needed to keep the project on schedule, Dr. McCuistion said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in NASA's planetary sciences division met with the NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, on Friday to discuss the status of the mission. Dr. McCuistion said the meeting was regularly scheduled and typical for any of NASA's flagship missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rover, the Mars Science Laboratory, will be about the size of a small sport utility vehicle and weigh more than 2,000 pounds, much larger and heavier than the two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, currently exploring Mars. While the current rovers carry only about 11 pounds of scientific instruments, the new rover is to carry about 165 pounds of instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When originally approved, the project had a budget of $1.6 billion. Before the latest overrun, costs had already grown to $1.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. McCuistion declined to estimate the size of the latest overrun or what effect it might have on other NASA planetary missions. ''We haven't fully resolved that,'' he said, but said additional financing would be needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Congress to date has been very supportive,'' Dr. McCuistion said. ''I fully believe Congress will support us as we go forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a presentation to the planetary science subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council last week, Dr. McCuistion told panel members that the overrun might be about $100 million, said Sean C. Solomon, chairman of the subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other options that NASA officials have put aside for the moment are delaying the launching by one or two years and canceling the mission altogether.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space is for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA looks ahead toward five years without shuttle flights and struggles to develop the next generation of spacecraft within its budget, the Russian space program has found ways to make space pay. And in doing so, the former Soviet Union has shown that it is leading the way toward capitalism in space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a Soyuz rocket carries two crew members to the International Space Station on Sunday, there will be a paying passenger aboard. Richard Garriott, a successful computer game designer whose father, Owen Garriott, flew two missions for NASA in the 1970s, will carry science experiments to space and document his journey on the Web -- and all for $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garriott is the sixth person to become what NASA calls a spaceflight participant -- the space agency frowns on using the term ''astronaut'' for people who haven't been selected and trained for the program. But Mr. Garriott hates the term ''space tourist,'' he said. ''This is much more than a mere lark.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has, he noted, undergone months of training and plans to bring an array of experiments to the station involving protein crystal growth that could help pave the way for commercial exploitation of the zero-gravity environment. ''Space is going to be a very valuable place,'' he said, and experiments like his are ''what's going to open the door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia, however, might not have the monopoly on space tourism for long. Another company, Virgin Galactic, plans to begin taking clients to the cusp of space in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, founded by Sir Richard Branson, will fly a spaceship designed by Burt Rutan and based on SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize in 2004. More than 250 people have put down the full $200,000 fare in anticipation of the first suborbital flights. Other companies, including <span class="companylink">XCOR Aerospace</span> or Mojave, Calif., are planning suborbital craft of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of people paying their way to space was revolutionary in 2001, when Dennis Tito, a financier, flew to the International Space Station for a reported $20 million aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Now five people have put money down and strapped in through Space Adventures, the company that arranges the trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Garriott had hoped to take that first flight, but the dot-com stock market crash diminished his fortune and forced him to defer that dream. His interest in space is longstanding and he has used his software fortune to collect items as varied as a spare Sputnik. It was made before the world's first spacecraft was launched by the Soviet Union on Oct. 4, 1957, three years before he was born. The New York Times wrote about his collection last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The training, he said in an interview, has been arduous and fun. He has experienced zero gravity in a plane flying a repeating parabolic course and has felt high G forces in a Russian centrifuge; he and his crewmates nearly collapsed during a drill in which they had to wriggle into their water rescue suits within the stifling confines of a Soyuz capsule -- a process he called ''the most difficult thing I've done.'' (Everything went smoothly the next day.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Anderson, the chief executive of Space Adventures, said that his company is doing for private citizens what NASA does when it buys passage to the International Space station aboard a Soyuz. ''Why should government employees be the only ones to go into space?'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For $3 million, Space Adventures offers ''backup crew'' participation in which customers get all of the training that the spaceflight participant will get -- without the flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies may not get their clients to space, but they do take advantage of the fact that Russia's space program has welcomed capitalism with open arms. Mir Corp., a travel company based in Washington state, takes well-heeled tourists to Baikonur to see launches and provides tours of Moscow, including the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Grimes, the founder of Mir Corp, who has been working in the field of Russian tourism since 1987, said tours typically cost about $19,000 per person, and despite the toughening economic times, he said, ''you'd be surprised how many people have enough money to take expensive trips these days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a trip scheduled for this month to coincide with Mr. Garriott's launch, Mir Corp. offered a zero-gravity flight for $5,690 per person, centrifuge training (from $1,990 to $4,490 per person), and space suit training ($4490)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians have strict health requirements for such bonuses as the centrifuge and training in the enormous swimming pool that simulates spacewalking; Mr. Grimes says, ''Every time I get somebody who wants to do it, they keep rejecting them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company, Incredible Adventures, takes clients to the 68,000 feet in Russian Mig-31 fighters, which the company calls the ''edge of space.'' It is far short of the more than 300,000 feet that is generally considered to be the beginning of space, but it does provide a view of black sky above and is much higher than commercial airliners fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the $200,000 that Virgin Galactic is charging sounds like a lot of money to pay for a few minutes of black sky and weightlessness, Mr. Anderson said, ''who would have believed 10 years ago that there were that many people willing to pay $35 million to go to space?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, for that matter, twice as much? On Monday, Space Adventures announced that its fifth client to go to orbit, Charles Simonyi, had signed up for a second trip.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STAR CITY, Russia -- Garrett Reisman was on his way to this formerly secret military base for several weeks of training, making his way through Kennedy Airport, when his cellphone rang. It was his boss, Steven W. Lindsey, the head of NASA's astronaut office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Come back to Houston. They've canceled your training -- they're playing hardball,'' Mr. Reisman recalled his boss saying. He was caught in a momentarily important dispute between NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Mr. Reisman's aborted trip was just a bump in the road on the way to space: he spent three months aboard the International Space Station earlier this year, performed a spacewalk and even traded jokes over a video link with Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone who works with the Russian space program has similar stories to tell of implacable bureaucrats, byzantine rules and decisions that seem capricious at best. And many of those stories are played out here in Star City, where cosmonauts and, now, astronauts from all over the world train to fly on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to go to the $100 billion International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Star City has become an important second home for Americans working with their Russian counterparts, and it is about to become more important still. During the five-year gap after NASA shuts down the space shuttle program in 2010 and the next generation of spacecraft makes its debut by 2015, Russia will have the only ride for humans to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap, which was planned by the Bush administration to create the next generation of American spacecraft without significantly increasing NASA's budget, is controversial. But it is also all but inevitable, because much of the work to shut down the shuttles is under way, and the path to the new Constellation craft would be hard to compress even with additional financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who work side by side with their Russian counterparts say that strong relationships and mutual respect have resulted from the many years of collaboration. And they say that whatever the broader geopolitical concerns about relying on Russia for space transportation during the five years when the United States cannot get to the space station on its own rockets, they believe that the multinational partnership that built the station will hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an amazing political achievement,'' Mr. Reisman said. ''We've gone through so many different administrations,'' not just in the United States and Russia, but in the dozen other nations that have taken part in building the orbiting laboratory. ''It survived all of that,'' he said. ''It's held together, and it's only strengthened over time as we've learned to work together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand why people like Mr. Reisman believe the next 7 years can work, it is important to understand the previous 15, when the United States and Russia joined forces, first putting Americans aboard the Russian Mir space station and then building the International Space Station together. That joining of forces occurred here, at Star City. And in some ways, it did not have an auspicious start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the earliest days of the partnership, in the mid-1990s, after the Soviet Union had crumbled and the new Russia was struggling to be born, scarcity of supplies meant real hunger. ''There was no food on the shelves at all,'' said Dr. Michael Barratt, who worked among the first crews to prepare astronauts who would serve aboard the Mir. ''Five nights out of seven, we had rice and beans.'' John McBrine, the current director of American operations at Star City, lost 30 pounds during his first stint, from July to October of 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those early days were also marked by wariness and distrust, and the first Americans had a strong impression they were being watched. Mark Bowman, an early contract employee in Russia who is now back in Moscow as deputy director of NASA's human space flight program in Russia, recalled a weekly teleconference with his boss in Houston. ''Thirty minutes into the call the line would go dead,'' Mr. Bowman said. ''And that would happen every 30 minutes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day during the teleconference, Mr. Bowman warned 28 minutes in that the line was about to go dead and said testily, ''I sure wish these damned KGB guys would get longer tapes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The next telecon we had,'' Mr. Bowman recalled, ''I swear to you, it went 45 minutes and then it went dead.'' Apparently, he said, his hosts had upgraded to 90-minute cassettes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energia, the spacecraft manufacturing company near the Mission Control Center in Korolev, near Moscow, would not let the Americans enter its facilities. Instead, Energia rented part of a nearby engineering college to prepare American hardware for the station. ''The heat didn't work,'' Mr. Bowman said, and the winter of 1994-95 was particularly bitter, he said, with temperatures that reached minus-30 degrees. The workers wore gloves and parkas indoors. Delicate biological experiments designed for use inside the climate-controlled station froze and had to be replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energia ultimately put a heating unit into the Americans' office: workers wrapped a wire made from a heat-resistant alloy, nichrome, around an asbestos-covered pipe and plugged it into the wall outlet. The exposed wire was doubly dangerous, Mr. Bowman recalled: brush up against it, and ''you'd get a zap and a burn at the same time.'' The glow was warning enough; no one touched it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the lack of creature comforts, the high level of secrecy in the Russian program troubled Americans even more deeply. The Russians did not fully explain in June 1997, for example, how risky an attempted manual docking with a cargo vehicle would be for the Mir and its crew. When the rendezvous resulted in a collision that endangered the lives of two cosmonauts and Michael Foale, the American astronaut aboard the rickety station at the time, the Americans were largely in the dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next seven years look brighter, and warmer. ''Things have improved so much since then,'' Mr. Bowman said. The Russian system has become more open, and the level of personal comfort and convenience has improved greatly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of the unreliable telephone service of the old days, Mr. Bowman's digital phone system can be reached as if it were a local phone on the NASA network. ''It's just as if I was at the Johnson Space Center,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American offices at Star City are in a building known as the Prophy, for Prophylactorium, where cosmonauts lived in quarantine before flights. Today it is called the Apollo-Soyuz Hotel, in honor of the historic rendezvous. At least the Americans call it that, Mr. McBrine said; the Russians, he said, ''call it the Soyuz-Apollo Hotel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA rents the second floor, dull offices with wood paneling and greenish fluorescent lighting. ''We're not very aesthetic here,'' said Mr. McBrine, apologetically. Here translators interpret the voluminous course materials for the astronauts -- who learn Russian and take their classes in the language -- and administrative assistants schedule the vans that ferry visitors from the airports to Star City and into Moscow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, 7 NASA civil servants, 9 American contractors and 55 Russian contractors are working in Russia for the American space agency. A steady stream of astronauts, flight controllers, doctors, scientists, engineers and officials cycles through -- and many of them want to be taken to see the sights and restaurants of Moscow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a work hard, play hard environment,'' Mr. McBrine said, but he added that the play used to be much harder. Tales of excess from the early days of the American-Russian partnership are legendary; many involve the Russian hosts urging their guests into epic rounds of vodka toasts. Over time, Mr. McBrine said, ''The novelty has kind of worn off.'' Instead of testing one another's ability to handle alcohol, he said, ''we've become colleagues and great friends. There's none of that pressure anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the Americans live in a set of duplexes at Star City that look a little like suburban condominiums that have been dropped, seemingly, from space into this Soviet landscape of brick buildings, fences and barriers. They were designed and built to United States standards so that visitors could, for example, plug their laptops into the wall without having to dig around for an adapter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McBrine and his staff work at building a sense of community. Each day starts in Mr. McBrine's cottage with a gathering around a large coffeepot for Americans who are working long term or just passing through. Regular potluck dinners are an even larger part of fighting the sense of isolation. On any given evening, Mr. McBrine's dining room might be crowded with American astronauts, NASA staff members, Russian cosmonauts, spacefarers from agencies in Japan and Europe, or the occasional multimillionaire space tourist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a typical dinner in April, two astronauts, Dr. Barratt and Cmdr. Scott J. Kelly, were bantering about food. Dr. Barratt had earned raves for a homemade Thai peanut chicken dish with a surprisingly hearty burn and excellent smoked salmon from Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle. Commander Kelly, taking a more Jersey Guy perspective, extolled the virtues of Jimmy Buffs, a restaurant in West Orange where the hot dogs are loaded with onions, peppers and potatoes. ''Heart attack on a plate!'' he said with pride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downstairs, Shep's Bar waited for them. It is a dim basement room down a flight of rough wooden steps, with a few couches and chairs, a big-screen television, a pool table and tired bar decorations. Duck through a low rectangular hole in one of the room's walls and there is the gym, full of American-made treadmills and other exercise machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Shep'' is William Shepherd, the first commander of the International Space Station, who set the place up with private donations. Mr. McBrine lauds the gathering spot as ''our own little Americana,'' a homey place in an isolated location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Shep's is a sensitive subject. NASA is still stinging from a report in 2007 that suggested astronauts may have flown while drunk. The report referred to two incidents in anonymous accusations from flight surgeons, and no one was found to have actually piloted a shuttle while drunk. And nothing in the report had anything to do with Shep's Bar. But the late-night jokes and editorial cartoons created an image of a space agency packed with boozers, and workers like Mr. McBrine remain a bit sensitive about reinforcing that impression by talking about their modest clubhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know what we do in Shep's Bar more than just about anything else?'' he asked. ''Just watch movies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should really change the name to Shep's Theater,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever it should be called, Mr. McBrine said, it is a comfortable place to grab a beer and kick back on a slow night. ''Or a Coke,'' Mr. McBrine said, a little nervously. ''Or a lemonade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant cultural differences remain between the Russians and Americans here. For example, working side by side with the Russians, the Americans say, has helped them understand the nations' approaches to safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Barratt said that when he first walked the grounds of Star City, he was surprised by how uneven the sidewalks were. At NASA, he said, ''there'd be big red placards'' warning people to watch their step. And if someone did fall, a lawsuit would soon follow. In Russia, he said, people simply watch their step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underlying point, said Mark Thiessen, the deputy to Mr. McBrine, is that ''Russians accept risk.'' Americans try ''to eliminate risk instead of minimize it.'' The American approach is laudable, he said, but not always possible, and Americans end up more cautious than Russians. ''No one is willing to say, 'I accept this risk,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many who write about the Russian space program focus on the impression of creaky age that the program can give -- the abandoned buildings and rust at the launching site in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and the fact that the basic design of the Soyuz spacecraft has not changed in some 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But American experts suggest that the Russians' disregard for cosmetic perfection and development is immaterial, and that the age of the design shows a conservative approach to the risks of space travel that has served them well. ''They spend their money where they have to,'' said Philip Cleary, a former director of NASA's human space flight program in Russia. ''They're not so much worried about splashing a new coat of paint on a building if it's not required.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Americans insist that, appearances aside, the Russians take safety every bit as seriously as they do. The result, several astronauts said, is that they have confidence in the Soyuz, which is as sturdy and dependable as a Kalashnikov rifle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Its inherent design is very robust,'' said Edward T. Lu, an astronaut who lived aboard the station in 2003 and now works for <span class="companylink">Google</span>. He has flown to the space station and returned on a Soyuz, and he brought up two recent Soyuz re-entries, in which the capsule malfunctioned and tumbled back to Earth in a steep ''ballistic'' path that subjected those inside to G-forces higher than usual. The astronauts were safe, however, because of the simplicity and strength of the Soyuz design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Capt. Mark E. Kelly, an astronaut and the twin brother of Scott Kelly, put it, ''You could throw that thing into the atmosphere like a rock,'' with its orientation ''sideways and backwards,'' and ''as long as the parachute opens, the crew is probably going to live. You can't do that with the shuttle, as everybody knows.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the shuttle will soon be out of the picture. Those who are most familiar with the nations' joint efforts in space say that the controversial pause between American flights can go smoothly, if the politicians would only stay out of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Americans say they have learned a great deal about getting things done in Russia. They know that the first answer to any request is likely to be no, but that negotiations can often bring things around to yes. Getting to know the people you deal with is more important than the rules. ''No agreement is better than your relationship,'' Dr. Barratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And none of them questions the dedication of the Russian counterparts. At the worst of the Soviet economic crisis, Dr. Barratt said, workers ''were told to go on vacation'' for a couple of months so they would not have to be paid. ''They showed up at work the next day,'' he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Foale, who has lived aboard both the Mir and the International Space Station, said, ''Russia has always seen the United States as both Enemy No. 1 and Partner No. 1.'' The leaders take a very long view, he said, and ''they do not play chess badly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important thing to ensure future cooperation, Dr. Foale said, is to firm up a strategy for international cooperation in getting to the Moon, so that Russia will have a stake in the partnership and the outcome. ''We only have to hint at a strategy, and I don't think we'll have a problem,'' he said. ''But we have to have a strategy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American workers at Star City say that on a personal level, geopolitics simply do not matter. Mr. Thiessen said that when such issues came up in conversation with his Russian counterparts, they would say: ''That's politics. Let the government worry about the government. We're engineers. Let's solve this problem.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Satisfied that they know what caused the Hubble Space Telescope to shut down two weeks ago, NASA engineers will begin to reboot it on Wednesday morning, the agency said. The telescope should be back to performing normal science by Friday morning, said Art Whipple, manager of the Hubble Space Telescope Systems Management Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The orbiting eye has been out of commission since late September, when a router that formats data and helps relay it to the ground failed, causing the telescope to go automatically into a ''safe mode.'' The device has a backup channel. But to restore it, the engineers have to activate the backup channels in other components of the observatory, none of which have been turned on since the telescope was launched in 1990. So engineers wanted to wait until they were sure it would be safe.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble Space Telescope is still blind after its science systems failed to fully restart on Thursday. Last month, a device that prepares data from the telescope's instruments for transmission to the ground failed. Engineers reconfigured the telescope to use a backup channel, and on Wednesday they started turning everything back on. The backup channel appeared to be working, NASA officials said. But then one of the cameras reported an incorrect voltage, the telescope computer suffered a glitch and the science systems were shut down again. The officials said they were optimistic they would be able to resume the telescope's observations of the universe, although not before late next week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW DELHI -- India launched its first unmanned spacecraft to orbit the moon early Wednesday, part of an effort to assert its power in space and claim some of the business opportunities there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indian mission is scheduled to last two years, prepare a three-dimensional atlas of the moon and prospect the lunar surface for natural resources, including uranium, a coveted fuel for nuclear power plants, according to the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research</span> Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft will not land on the moon, though it is supposed to send a small ''impactor'' probe to the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching of Chandrayaan-1, as the vehicle is called -- roughly translated as Moon Craft-1 -- comes about a year after China's first moon mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk of a space race with China could not be contained, even as Manmohan Singh, the Indian prime minister, was due to visit Beijing later in the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''China has gone earlier, but today we are trying to catch them, catch that gap, bridge the gap,'' Bhaskar Narayan, a director at the Indian space agency, was quoted by Reuters as having said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Indian lunar voyage is carrying two devices from NASA. One, the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, or M3, will assess mineral composition of the moon from orbit. The other, the Mini-SAR, will look for ice deposits in the moon's polar regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chandrayaan-1 was launched from a research station in Sriharikota, a barrier island off the coast of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moon mission, in addition to demonstrating technological capacity, can potentially yield commercial gains for India's space program. India's ability to put satellites into orbit has already resulted in lucrative deals; for example, Israel has sent up a satellite by means of an Indian launcher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is proof of India's technical capability in an advanced area of science,'' said Dipankar Banerjee, a retired army general who is the director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies here. ''India wants to be counted as one of the emerging players in Asia. Space is, of course, an important part of power projection.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission is not without domestic critics. Bharat Karnad, a strategic affairs analyst who frequently finds fault with the Congress Party-led coalition government, called the mission a ''grandiloquent'' effort designed to catch up with a far more advanced Chinese space program. ''It is kind of a prestige project the government has gotten into,'' Mr. Karnad said. ''This is misuse of resources that this country can ill afford at this point.''</p>

A pair of electrical anomalies, however, sent the telescope back into ''safe mode.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the anomalies, an incorrect voltage in Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, was the result of a timing problem between a pair of software routines in the camera and has been corrected, said Art Whipple, an engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second anomaly was apparently a temporary short circuit or some other ghost electrical signal that caused the telescope's payload computer and the router to reset themselves. The payload computer handles Hubble's scientific data and commands the instruments. There was apparently no lasting harm and no fuses were blown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Events like this are not uncommon in electrical circuits that have been turned off for a long time,'' said Mr. Whipple, adding that ''we might see more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well, Hubble's main camera, the wide-field planetary camera 2, should begin sending pictures back to Earth on Saturday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An answer in the Q&amp;A column on Oct. 14 about what became of the golf balls the astronaut Alan Shepard hit on the Moon, drawing on an interview Shepard gave in 1991, misstated the timing and details of another demonstration that showed an almost complete absence of air resistance on the Moon. It was the astronaut David Scott, not ''other astronauts,'' who did the demonstration, and he dropped a feather and a hammer that fell at the same speed, not a feather and a lead ball. That demonstration took place during the Apollo 15 mission in July 1971, which was after -- not before -- Shepard's Apollo 14 mission, in February 1971.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AN unmanned spacecraft from India -- that most worldly and yet otherworldly of nations -- is on its way to the moon. For the first time since man and his rockets began trespassing on outer space, a vessel has gone up from a country whose people actually regard the moon as a god.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chandrayaan (or ''moon craft'') is the closest India has got to the moon since the epic Hindu sage, Narada, tried to reach it on a ladder of considerable (but insufficient) length -- as my grandmother's bedtime version of events would have it. So think of this as a modern Indian pilgrimage to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, a week before the launching, millions of Hindu women embarked on a customary daylong fast, broken at night on the first sighting of the moon's reflection in a bowl of oil. (This fast is done to ensure a husband's welfare.) But reverence for the moon is not confined to traditional Indian housewives: The Web site of the <span class="companylink">Indian Space Research</span> Organization -- the body that launched the Chandrayaan -- includes a verse from the Rig Veda, a sacred Hindu text that dates back some 4,000 years: ''O Moon! We should be able to know you through our intellect,/ You enlighten us through the right path.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is tempted, in all this, to dwell on the seeming contradiction between religion and science, between reason and superstition. And yet, anyone who has been to India will have noted also its ''modernity of tradition.'' The phrase, borrowed from the political scientists Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph, might explain the ability of devout Hindus -- many of them, no doubt, rocket scientists -- to see no disharmony between ancient Vedic beliefs and contemporary scientific practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hindu astrological system is predicated on lunar movements: so the moon is a big deal in astrology-obsessed India. That said, the genius of modern Hinduism lies in its comfort with, and imperviousness to, science. A friend tells me of an episode from his childhood in Varanasi, the sacred Hindu city. Days after Apollo 11 landed on the moon, a model of the lunar module was placed in a courtyard of the most venerable temple in the city. The Hindu faithful were hailing man-on-the-moon; there was no suggestion that the Americans had committed sacrilege. (Here, I might add -- with a caveat against exaggeration -- that science sometimes struggles to co-exist with faith in the United States in ways that would disconcert many Indians.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the Chandrayaan is also a grand political gesture -- space exploration in the service of national pride. This kind of excursion may provoke yawns at NASA, but judging from round-the-clock local coverage it has received, the mission has clearly inflamed the imagination and ambition of Indians. Yes, even moon-worshipping ones.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Succumbing to a swirling dust storm and the cold of an encroaching Martian winter, the Phoenix Mars lander fell quiet for a day, before coming back to life Thursday evening, albeit weakly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lander's batteries appeared to have drained, mission managers said, with all systems, including its heaters, shut down. The mission managers had instructed the spacecraft to wake up and send word of its condition at 12:30 a.m. Thursday via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which was passing overhead. It did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the spacecraft is programmed with a so-called Lazarus mode that enables it to resuscitate itself and recharge its batteries during the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once restarted, the lander conserved its energy for 17 hours, then tried to communicate for two hours with any orbiter passing overhead, repeating the cycle until it received new instructions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lander successfully communicated with the Mars Odyssey orbiter Thursday evening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA statement said: ''The communication reinforced a diagnosis that the spacecraft is in a precautionary mode triggered by low energy. Mission engineers are assessing the lander's condition and steps necessary for returning to science operations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix landed in May, during spring in the Martian northern polar region, to study a vast expanse of ice just below the surface. It has found signs that the ice may have melted in the past -- the presence of carbonates, which form in the presence of liquid water -- but its measurements also show current conditions to be very dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lander's last experiment, using a small oven to cook a sample of soil, was completed over the weekend. Data from the experiment was sent back before the shutdown and could answer whether the Martian soil contains organic compounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix's mission was scheduled to last three months but was extended to allow scientists to squeeze every bit of data from the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the dwindling sunlight of the Martian winter, the lander's solar panels will produce less energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dust storm on Monday further reduced the amount of power the panels could produce. Coupled with the energy drain from the last experiment and surface temperatures as low as minus-141 degrees Fahrenheit at night, the spacecraft put itself into its safe mode on Tuesday, shutting down nonessential activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lander also shut down one of its two batteries and switched to backup electronics systems, and some energy-saving commands sent to the primary electronics were not performed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the lander revived, its demise is probably less than a month away. Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona, the mission's principal investigator, said it would be nice to watch winter develop through the lander's instruments. ''But that's gravy,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We got what we came for.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an electrical malfunction caused it to go dormant a month ago, the Hubble Space Telescope is back in business. But the space shuttle mission to repair and upgrade the Hubble has been pushed back again, NASA officials said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To show this week that the orbiting eye still has the same chops as ever, astronomers from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore used Hubble's wide-field planetary camera 2 to record this image of a pair of smoke-rings galaxies known as Arp 147.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The galaxies, about 450 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus, apparently collided in the recent cosmic past. According to Mario Livio, of the space telescope institute, one of the galaxies passed through the other, causing a circular wave, like a pebble tossed into a pond, that has now coalesced into a ring of new blue stars. The center of the impacted galaxy can be seen as a reddish blur along the bottom of a blue ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hubble went down at the end of September when a router that gathers and formats scientific data for transmission to the ground failed. There is a backup data channel on board, but it had not been used in the 18 years that Hubble has been aloft. Last weekend, Hubble's engineers succeeded in waking it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA hopes to replace the crippled router when astronauts visit the telescope for the last scheduled servicing mission. But in the announcement on Thursday, NASA officials said that a spare unit would not be ready for a hoped-for February launching, and that the mission would be pushed back to May.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A picture caption on Nov. 4 with an article about minerals on Mars described incorrectly what the colors in one of three photographs of Martian terrain represent. The magenta and blue show deposits of a type of mineral called phyllosilicates, not opals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Nov 14 2008 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still puzzling over how warm and wet Mars may have once been, scientists are now seeing global mineralogical signs that the planet was at least occasionally wet for the first two billion years of its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an article in the November issue of the journal Geology, scientists working with data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter report that they have spotted widespread deposits of opals and related minerals on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opals belong to a class of minerals known as hydrated silicas, with water molecules wedged into silicon-based minerals like quartz. The formation of hydrated silicas requires liquid water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most interesting is that the opal deposits lie in areas that appear to have formed only about two billion years ago. Previously, spacecraft have detected other water-bearing minerals like clays in regions that date back more than 3.5 billion years. Mars, like the other planets in the solar system, is about 4.5 billion years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The water was more widespread and extended to younger times,'' said Scott L. Murchie, a staff scientist at Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Laboratory and the principal investigator for the orbiter's spectrometer, which found the opal evidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Dr. Murchie and other scientists reported that the orbiter had detected vast deposits of the claylike minerals on the older terrains. Images also showed ancient lakebeds with accumulations of the minerals, indicating standing water persisted for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The presence of water on Mars has been known for many years; its ice caps, easily visible from space, are largely made of frozen water. The unanswered question is how often the ice has melted. The Phoenix Mars Lander, now nearing the end of its six-month mission, is exploring whether the arctic ice has melted in recent millennia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most intriguing possibility is that Mars, when it was less than a billion years old, was warm enough for lakes and oceans of liquid water -- and with that, the possibility of life. The planet's landforms offer compelling evidence for flowing water: immense canyons and channels, dried-up river deltas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think most people agree there was lots of water on the surface in the first few hundred million years,'' said Maria Zuber, a professor of geophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's later on when I get confused, although I'm confused about the whole thing. That's what makes it interesting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some scientists have suggested that rare catastrophic floods carved the landforms, either in the aftermath of an impact by an asteroid or comet or by underground water -- melted by residual volcanic warmth -- bursting to the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who believe that liquid water was more persistent were nonetheless perplexed when earlier spacecraft detected only small quantities of carbonates, minerals that should have formed in large amounts from reactions involving carbon dioxide and liquid water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But data collected by the two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, show a highly acidic environment that prevented the formation of carbonates. ''That part of the story is fairly well agreed upon,'' Dr. Zuber said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two rovers have also found signs of past water. Opportunity found hydrated sulfates in the Meridiani Planum rocks; Spirit found opal-like minerals similar to those spotted by the Reconnaissance Orbiter from space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But planetary scientists are still trying to explain the transition of Mars from lots of water to today's cold and dry climate. In fact, they are still trying to explain how it ever had lots of liquid water. Even if young Mars were enshrouded in a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide belched by giant volcanoes, climatologists have had trouble coaxing enough global warming in their computer simulations to push temperatures above the melting point of ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James F. Kasting, a professor of geosciences at Penn State, believes he may have figured out how to warm up Mars. In research that he will present in December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, the key may be nitrogen dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his climate models, carbon dioxide did act as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat near the surface, but it also reflected shorter wavelengths of light back into space, limiting the amount of heating. His models peaked at about minus-40 degrees Fahrenheit. Nitrogen dioxide, which is also released by volcanic eruptions, reduces the reflectivity of Mars in the models. With more light absorbed, temperatures jumped 100 degrees. ''That would be more than you need,'' Dr. Kasting said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he still needed to demonstrate that the nitrogen dioxide would mix throughout the atmosphere rather than remain in pockets around the volcanoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if scientists figure out the water question, they have another problem: what happened to the Martian air? The climate models suggest early Mars had an atmosphere denser than Earth's. Now, it's a faint wisp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well, we don't know,'' Dr. Zuber said. ''One day we're going to nail that one. There's a whole bunch of things on my list of things to do.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix Mars lander is dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers said Monday that they had not heard from the NASA spacecraft for a week and that they thought it had probably fallen quiet for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this time, we're pretty convinced that the vehicle is no longer available for us to use,'' said Barry Goldstein, the project manager. ''We're actually ceasing operations, declaring an end to mission operations at this point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the onset of winter and declining power generated by the Phoenix's solar panels, managers knew the lander would succumb soon, but had hoped to squeeze out a few more weeks of weather data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Oct. 27, just after Phoenix finished its last major experiment analyzing Martian soil, an unexpected dust storm hit. The batteries, already low from running the experiment, ran out of energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft first put itself into a low-energy ''safe mode,'' then fell silent. It revived itself on Oct. 30, but, with the dust still swirling, was never able to fully recharge its batteries. Each day, the solar panels would generate enough electricity for the spacecraft to wake up, but then the batteries drained again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last communication came on Nov. 2. Mr. Goldstein said the orbiting spacecraft would continue to listen for a few more weeks on the faint chance that the Phoenix defies their expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix landed in May to examine the northern arctic plains, and the $428 million mission, originally scheduled to last three months, was extended twice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm just thrilled to death what we've been able to do here,'' said Peter H. Smith of the University of Arizona, the mission's principal investigator. The spacecraft accomplished all of its main objectives, but some science remained unfinished. The Martian soil proved to be extremely clumpy, and the spacecraft had recurrent trouble getting the samples through gratings into the spacecraft's laboratory apparatus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Smith admitted disappointment that a sample from one of the trenches that the Phoenix had dug was never successfully analyzed. ''We got it all the way up to the instrument and even tried pressing it down,'' Dr. Smith said. ''But it wouldn't go in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Smith highlighted what the Phoenix did discover. It confirmed a layer of ice not far below the surface. It found some carbonates and clays, which suggest that liquid water may have be present within the past few millennia. It found the arctic soil to be alkaline, not acidic as has been observed in other parts of Mars. It also discovered perchlorates, a class of chemicals that in high concentrations can be toxic to life, but which can also serve as a food source for some microbes.The spacecraft took 25,000 photographs, including panoramas of the landing and microscopic images of dust particles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really an Irish wake, not a funeral that we're looking forward to,'' said Douglas McCuiston, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA headquarters. ''NASA got what it wanted out of this mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data may yet reveal the presence of carbon-based molecules that could be building blocks for life, Dr. Smith said, and that the region might, at least occasionally, be suitable for life. The Phoenix was not designed to look directly for signs of life. Dr. Smith said the scientists had begun writing the scientific articles describing their findings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming months, when sunlight disappears entirely in the northern plains, temperatures will fall to minus-240 to minus-300 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Phoenix will become encased within carbon dioxide ice. When spring returns, NASA plans to try reviving the Phoenix again, but the expectation is that the spacecraft's electronics will not survive the long, deep freeze.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- When the space shuttle Endeavour lifts off, it will be taking Donald R. Pettit back to the place he calls his ''home away from home'' -- the International Space Station. Mr. Pettit was serving five and a half months aboard the station in 2003 when the shuttle Columbia was lost over Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His duties during this mission, scheduled for liftoff at 7:55 p.m. on Friday, include operating the robotic arms of the station and shuttle, and transferring cargo onto the station that the shuttle brought up from Earth. Among the astronaut corps, Mr. Pettit is known as a uncommonly gifted handyman who has rebuilt a jet engine in his garage workshop, and a guy who gets things done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is ''a point and shoot weapon,'' said Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson, the commander on the mission. ''All I have to do is say something, and he makes it happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his time on the station, he created amazing things. He used a hand drill, for example, to power a camera mount precisely so that he could track spots on the earth precisely on orbit; the rig allowed him to take stunning nighttime photos of cities around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he is best known outside the space program for ''Saturday Morning Science,'' a series of engaging educational videos he created on the station in which he demonstrated things like gyroscopic physics using CD players in zero gravity and fluid dynamics by pushing blobs of water together in midair. He carried on his video adventures in a subsequent trip to Antarctica for the Antarctic Search for Meteorites, financed by the National Science Foundation, to search for meteorites. Those videos were called ''Saturday Morning Science on Ice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Antarctica, he kept with him an odd long-handled spoon. He told the moving story behind his spoons in a posting from the station:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will be returning home on the Soyuz spacecraft. Unlike the Space Shuttle, there is precious little room for personal effects. I can return with perhaps three small items that will fit in my pocket. What will I choose? The combination pocket tools I brought engraved with my boys' names? There is one for each. I have been using them for my Space Station repair work and figured the boys would like to have something that daddy used to repair Space Station. I can picture my boys using them at Boy Scout jamboree. Should I return with my wife's favorite necklace, a small part of her that I brought along, much like before a great battle, a knight might keep the handkerchief from his lady? When I have periodically looked at this necklace, pleasant memories would come to mind. And I would smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After careful thought, I decided to bring none of these items home. I can always replace the pocket tools and I can buy my wife another necklace. There is no room for this kind of sentiment in the Soyuz spacecraft. What I have decided to bring home is truly unique to Space Station, something money and a trip to the shopping mall can never replace. I have decided to bring home my spoons. I have three Russian-made spoons. They are simple in design, being unpretentiously stamped from stainless steel. A small square embossed into the handle is the only visible marking. There is a hole in the handle for attaching a string so it won't float away. In space, it is not good to lose your spoon. While seemingly a good idea, eating with strings attached is a pain so we take our chances with the universe and cut our strings. What are truly unique about these spoons are their gracefully long handles. They are twice as long as a normal spoon yet the spoon part is standard teaspoon-sized. They allow one to gracefully shovel in dinner from deep plastic food pouches without getting your fingers all sticky-gooey with the stuff you are attempting to eat. They will make great camping spoons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Using these long handled spoons, I can picture my boys and I sitting around a campfire, eating beans out of the fire-charred can they were cooked in. As we chat about our world, our eyes will follow the sparks as they rise in the draft of hot air. Perhaps we will look at the stars and see Space Station pass overhead.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife's necklace, by the way, returned from the station in 2005, on the first shuttle to fly after the loss of Columbia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little more of the universe has been pried out of the shadows. Two groups of astronomers have taken the first pictures of what they say -- and other astronomers agree -- are most likely planets going around other stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The achievement, the result of years of effort on improved observational techniques and better data analysis, presages more such discoveries, the experts said, and will open the door to new investigations and discoveries of what planets are and how they came to be formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the tip of the iceberg,'' said Christian Marois of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Victoria, British Columbia. ''Now that we know they are there, there is going to be an explosion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marois is the leader of a team that recorded three planets circling a star known as HR 8799 that is 130 light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. The other team, led by Paul Kalas of the University of California, Berkeley, found a planet orbiting the star Fomalhaut, only 25 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Piscis Austrinus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview by e-mail, Dr. Kalas said that when he finally confirmed his discovery last May, ''I nearly had a heart attack.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In scratchy telescope pictures released Thursday in Science Express, the online version of the journal Science, the planets appear as fuzzy dots that move slightly around their star from exposure to exposure. Astronomers who have seen the new images agreed that these looked like the real thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think Kepler himself would recognize these as planets orbiting a star following his laws of orbital motion,'' Mark S. Marley of the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., wrote in an e-mail message elaborating on HR 8799.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 300 so-called extrasolar planets have been found circling distant stars, making their discovery the hottest and fastest-growing field in astronomy. But the observations have been made mostly indirectly, by dips in starlight as planets cross in front of their home star or by wobbles they induce going by it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers being astronomers, they want to actually see these worlds, but a few recent claims of direct observations have been clouded by debates about whether the bodies were really planets or failed stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every extrasolar planet detected so far has been a wobble on a graph,'' said Bruce Macintosh, an astrophysicist from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and a member of Dr. Marois's team. ''These are the first pictures of an entire system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planetary systems are anchored by young bright stars more massive than our own Sun and swaddled in large disks of dust, the raw material of worlds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three planets orbiting HR 8799 are roughly 10, 9 and 6 times the mass of Jupiter, and orbit their star in periods of 450, 180 and 100 years respectively, all counterclockwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fomalhaut planet is about three times as massive as Jupiter, according to Dr. Kalas's calculations, and is on the inner edge of a huge band of dust, taking roughly 872 years to complete a revolution of its star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both systems appear to be scaled-up versions of our own solar system, with giant planets in the outer reaches, leaving plenty of room for smaller planets to lurk undetected in the warmer inner regions. Dust rings lie even farther out, like the Kuiper belt of icy debris extending beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a window into what our own solar system might have looked like when it was 60 million years old,'' Dr. Marois said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Seager, a planetary theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was significant that the planets in both cases seemed to be associated with disks of dust, particularly Fomalhaut, one of the brightest and closest stars known to be host to a massive disk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fomalhaut is like a Hollywood star to astronomers, so we have some personal excitement here,'' Dr. Seager said. ''It feels like finding out that one of your four closest friends just won the lottery big time''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said the triple-planet system in Pegasus was particularly promising, ''as we expect planets to form in systems in general, whereas spurious background interlopers will generally appear as single 'planets.' '' But he and others cautioned that much more study of these objects was necessary and that the masses imputed to them were still highly uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being able to see planets directly opens the door to spectroscopic observations that can help determine the composition, temperature and other physical characteristics of planets and allow for comparisons with one another and with their parent stars. Dr. Macintosh said he hoped to train a spectroscope on his new planets as early as Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new images are the fruits of a long campaign by astronomers to see more and more of the unseeable. In particular, it is a triumph for the emerging technology of adaptive optics, in which telescope mirrors are jiggled and warped slightly many times a second to compensate for the atmospheric turbulence that blurs star images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem in seeing other planets is picking them out of the glare of their parent stars, which are millions of times brighter, at least in visible light. As a result, planet hunters usually look for infrared, or heat radiation, which is emitted copiously by planets still shedding heat from the process of formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their observations, Dr. Marois and his colleagues used the 8-meter in diameter Gemini North and the 10-meter Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, both of which had been fitted with adaptive optics. Then they processed the images with a special computer program, which Dr. Marois described as ''a software coronagraph,'' for processing the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team first spied a pair of dots about four billion and six billion miles out from HR 8799 in October last year. Following up, they discovered a third planet closer in, at about two billion miles. Then they discovered an old observation from 2004, which also showed the planets and how far they had moved around the star in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Seeing the orbit is one of the coolest things,'' Dr. Macintosh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kalas did his work with the Hubble Space Telescope, which is immune to turbulence because it is in space. He used a coronagraph to block light from the actual star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he had been driven to look for a planet around Fomalhaut after Hubble photographs in October 2004 showed that a dust ring around the star had a suspiciously sharp inner edge, often a clue that the ring is being sculpted by the gravity of some body orbiting nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second set of Hubble observations, in July 2006, revealed a dot moving counterclockwise around the star. ''I basically held my breath for three days until I could confirm the existence of Fomalhaut in all of my data,'' Dr. Kalas recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fomalhaut is also a young star, about 200 million years old, and its dust ring extends 11 billion to 20 billion miles from its planet, Dr. Kalas said. In order not to disturb or roil the dust ring, Fomalhaut's planet must be less than three Jupiter masses, well within regulation planet size, Dr. Kalas and his collaborators calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more detailed analysis, with another team member, Eugene Chiang of the University of California, Berkeley, as lead author will appear in the Astrophysical Journal, Dr. Kalas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message, Dr. Kalas pointed out that Fomalhaut was the closest exoplanet yet discovered, ''close enough to contemplate sending spacecraft there.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- If all goes as planned, a team of intrepid space plumbers and lube-job specialists will lift off on Friday for a visit to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like all recent missions, this trip is mainly devoted to completing the $100 billion orbiting laboratory. The equipment heading skyward on the shuttle Endeavour is part of NASA's plan to double the station's crew size to six next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Included in the payload are a second toilet and new sleep quarters, and the first-ever station refrigerator for beverages so astronauts can enjoy a cold drink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is getting the most attention is a system the astronauts will install that recycles and purifies the water used on the station. It is the kind of technology that is necessary if people are going to establish long-term outposts on the Moon or Mars, but it involves what astronauts acknowledge is an ''ick'' factor associated with what amounts to drinking one another's urine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald R. Pettit, one of the astronauts on this mission, said he calls the new system ''the coffee maker,'' because ''it's going to take yesterday's coffee and make it into today's coffee.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour is scheduled to lift off at 7:55 p.m. on Friday. The four spacewalks planned for the 15-day mission will be largely devoted to lubricating the two rotary joints, each 10 feet in diameter, that help keep the station's solar arrays pointed at the Sun. Last year, the joint on the right side was found to be fouled with metal shavings -- a sign that it was grinding itself into ruin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three spacewalkers -- Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper, Capt. Steven G. Bowen of the Navy and Lt. Col. Robert S. Kimbrough of the Army -- will clean the joint and lubricate it, and will lubricate the left-hand joint as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A storm front moving toward Florida could force a delay in the launching by a day or more. On Thursday, weather officers set the probability of a delay at 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technological glitches, the other factor that can cause shuttle launching delays, have not interfered. But as the shuttle's external fuel tank was being moved around at Kennedy Space Center, workers heard what has been called a ''clank in the tank.'' Since a bit of metal or other debris inside the tank could have disastrous consequences, the Kennedy team examined the tank in detail with fiber-optic scopes and other nondestructive means. They found nothing, which suggests that the sound might not have come from inside the tank at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers have said that if there is still an object in the tank, they believe it is not in a place that would do damage and would be held by filters that prevent such objects from making their way into the fuel lines and engines. After having talked with experts about the issue, the commander of this mission, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, said ''personally, I'm very comfortable'' that the clank does not present a flight risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour's pilot on this mission is Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force. The shuttle will also be taking Sandra H. Magnus to the station so she can begin a three-and-a-half-month stay. The crew will return with Gregory E. Chamitoff, an astronaut who has lived aboard the station since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Magnus will be among the first crew members to taste the recycled water if the installation is successful. She said she was amused by the repulsed reaction she gets from many people about the system. As she explained, water flushed from our earthly toilets eventually evaporates and rains down again, so, ''We drink recycled water every day -- on a little bit longer time scale.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH ALL DUE RESPECT to Richard Branson, in space travel, when one guy getting up in the middle of the night to use the facilities without waking up his neighbor is considered a giant leap for design, we are still light years away from a first-class ticket to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Garrett Finney. The former senior architect for NASA's Habitability Design Center, and now a consultant for NASA, is photographed here between Carl Conlee and Evan Twyford, two recent Rhode Island School of Design grads and full-time habitability-center designers, during the recent test run of a first-generation mock-up of a new rover. Working with their ''client,'' the astronaut Mike Gernhardt, as well as a team of about 25 NASA engineers, Conlee and Twyford are devising the interior of the module so that two people will be able to sleep, prepare and eat meals, exercise, use the facilities, drive around and conduct scientific research on missions lasting from two days to two weeks -- all in about 380 cubic feet. And you thought your apartment was small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As space becomes a home away from home, with the ultimate goal of establishing a permanent moon colony by 2020, so-called human design has come to play a larger role. ''They think design is about survival, and we come along and say we want to survive well,'' Finney says, squashing any Virgin Galactic-fueled fantasies. ''The psychological stress is amazing. This is not a serene environment. There is constant white noise, things beeping. It's like, 'Is that my phone or a death warning?' '' According to Finney, who has argued for luxuries like a window large enough for two people to look out of simultaneously, questions like ''How acceptable is it to have the toilet close to the table?'' quickly dissolve into questions like ''What is the definition of acceptable?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the only rover NASA is developing, but already it is showing promise. ''It appears to do a lot for its size and weight,'' Conlee says. What is more, no one seems to be complaining about how cool it looks. Among the innovations Conlee is most excited about is a ''suit port'' that eliminates the need for an air lock when entering and exiting the craft and a pair of retractable benches that can be configured into cozy individual crew quarters. At first he was opposed to the synthetic leather upholstery as being unnecessarily fancy, but even this has proved quite practical. ''It's easy to clean, and people have really taken to it,'' Conlee says. Such creature comforts aside, does Conlee think he could survive in the rover for two straight weeks? ''Yes,'' he says, without too much hesitation. ''But I would want to choose the colleague.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts ventured outside the International Space Station to do repair work, but lost a bag of tools they had taken along. Capt. Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper of the Navy, an astronaut on a mission to the station, was on the first spacewalk of the mission, which involves cleaning and greasing a balky rotary joint, when she discovered that a grease gun had erupted inside its tote bag. While she cleaned up that mess, the bag -- containing two grease guns, scrapers and other equipment -- floated irretrievably into space. NASA trains spacewalkers to tether and trap all objects they use, but it is not uncommon for the occasional bolt or single tool to be lost.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, NASA released a newly restored image of a younger Earth. It was taken from Lunar Orbiter 1 in 1966, the first of several orbiters that helped gather data for the first moon landing in 1969. The photograph shows Earth just cresting the Moon's curving horizon, the first picture of our planet framed by the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the photograph was published, in 1966, it looked like a newsprint version of a high-contrast snapshot from space, a stark scattering of whites and blacks. The data from the lunar orbiter was stored on old analog tape drives. Now, imaging experts at NASA have digitized those drives -- mining data that could not be recovered when they were first made -- and produced a high-resolution version of that historic photograph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rough surface of the moon no longer looks starkly black and white. It has been rendered instead in a broad palette of grays, which give the moonscape a dimensional presence it never had in the photograph that first appeared. The cloud patterns that hide the surface of Earth, a crescent earth, are much more subtle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is most evocative is the awareness that this is our planet in 1966, which feels like a very long time ago. A train of thought immediately presents itself. If scientists can recover extensive new information from old electronic data, shouldn't there be some way to peer beneath those clouds, back in time, and see how this planet looked when it had only half its current population?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is probably not possible to say that one Earth is ever more innocent than another. And yet there is a feeling of innocence hanging over that beclouded planet, which was just about to get the first glimpse of itself from the Moon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new $250 million system for the International Space Station to turn urine, sweat and other fluids into drinking water is off to a shaky start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts aboard the station assembled the system ahead of schedule and started it on Thursday, but it shut itself down. The unit was started again on Friday morning, but shut itself down after two hours. The problem involves a centrifuge in the distillation unit whose motor appears to be working too slowly, or it might involve sensors inaccurately reporting problems with the centrifuge, said Courtenay McMillan, a NASA flight director working on the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clifton, Va. -- A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects. Unmistakable new indications of this illness surfaced last month with NASA's decision to spend at least $100 million more on its poorly-managed, now-over-$2 billion Mars Science Laboratory. This decision to go forward with the project, a robotic rover, was made even though it has tripled in cost since its inception, it is behind schedule, there is no firm estimate of the final cost, and NASA hasn't disclosed the collateral damage inflicted on other programs and activities that depend on NASA's limited science budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to pour more money into the Mars Science Laboratory, which is scheduled for launching next year, may have been like many I witnessed as NASA's associate administrator for science. If so, then NASA's accomplished administrator, Mike Griffin, may have calculated that any move to cancel the Mars mission would be rebuffed by members of Congress protecting local jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Mars Science Laboratory is only the latest symptom of a NASA culture that has lost control of spending. The cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, successor to the storied Hubble, has increased from initial estimates near $1 billion to almost $5 billion. NASA's next two weather satellites, built for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have now inflated to over $3.5 billion each! The list goes on: N.P.P., S.D.O., LISA Pathfinder, Constellation and more. You don't have to know what the abbreviations and acronyms mean to get it: Our space program is running inefficiently, and without sufficient regard to cost performance. In NASA's science directorate alone, an internal accounting in 2007 found over $5 billion in increases since 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a scientist in charge of space sensors and entire space missions before I was at NASA, I myself was involved in projects that overran. But that's no excuse for remaining silent about this growing problem, or failing to champion reform. And when I articulated this problem as the NASA executive in charge of its science program and consistently curtailed cost increases, I found myself eventually admonished and then neutered by still higher ups, precipitating my resignation earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Endemic project cost increases at NASA begin when scientists and engineers (and sometimes Congress) burden missions with features beyond what is affordable in the stated budget. The problem continues with managers and contractors who accept or encourage such assignments, expecting to eventually be bailed out. It is worsened by managers who disguise the size of cost increases that missions incur. Finally, it culminates with scientists who won't cut their costs and members of Congress who accept steep increases to protect local jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? The costs of badly run NASA projects are paid for with cutbacks or delays in NASA projects that didn't go over budget. Hence the guilty are rewarded and the innocent are punished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider these examples: In NASA's astronomy program, the James Webb Space Telescope's $4 billion in cost increases have prevented the development of other important astronomy missions. In NASA's Earth science program, the ballooning price tags of missions already being built have severely delayed proposed missions to study global climate change and to pioneer early-warning systems for earthquakes, among others. In NASA's human exploration program, cost increases have slowed the development of a shuttle replacement, extending the looming multiyear gap in America's ability to launch human spaceflight missions. This is not to the benefit of science, or space exploration, or the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this is not the only damage being done. Our once-broad planetary program that has launched missions to the Moon, comets, asteroids and five planets since the mid-1990s has been so reduced -- largely by years of Mars overrun -- that all that remains in hardware development are just one lunar and one outer-planet mission. Even those two missions are endangered now by the Mars Science Laboratory's spiraling cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's main defense for paying still more for this new Mars rover: the $1.8 billion or more in already sunk cost. But good executive managers know that sunk costs are already spent -- more important is the collateral damage done to NASA's future portfolio, and how the coddling of errant projects encourages soaring costs, rather than cost control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This cancer is bad, but it is curable. The new presidential administration could begin by accounting for cost increases more honestly, using the initial basis on which missions are started, rather than today's practice of neglecting certain kinds of cost escalation. Further, scientists and engineers should be required, when formulating missions, to ensure their scope matches their budget. And NASA should be charged to reduce or cancel development projects that are not performing to cost. Of equal importance, Congress should turn from the self-serving protection of local NASA jobs to an ethic of responsible government that delivers results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, controlling the costs of space missions, while ensuring their success and safety, will be a steep challenge for NASA, but NASA's workforce, from technicians to top executives, is among the government's most dedicated and capable. This is a challenge that can be met with appropriate leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's space program has been the envy and inspiration of the world. It has made landmark scientific discoveries that are a lasting legacy of this nation's greatness. It has studied Earth in ways no other nation can match. And it is leading the world to develop the first outpost on the Moon and the first historic human expeditions to the planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To continue such accomplishments, NASA's managers and masters must all make cost performance just as important as mission successes, scientific discoveries and good jobs. In an era of unpopular, costly government bailouts, Americans have every right to demand that NASA cease bailing out its own errant projects and make cost increases rare, rather than routine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jarring the Mojave Desert calm with rumbling sonic booms, the shuttle Endeavour dropped out of a cloudless blue sky and glided to a smooth landing Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base in California to close out a 16-day assembly mission for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diverted from a planned landing in Florida by low clouds and high crosswinds at the Kennedy Space Center, Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy, the shuttle commander, guided the winged orbiter to a picture-perfect touchdown on Runway 4 at 4:25 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few moments later, Col. Eric A. Boe of the Air Force, the shuttle's pilot, released a red and white braking parachute and the shuttle rolled to a halt, wrapping up a 6.6-million-mile voyage that included 250 orbits since its launching on Nov. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wheels stopped, Houston,'' Captain Ferguson radioed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Copy, wheels stopped, Endeavour,'' replied Capt. Alan G. Poindexter of the Navy from the mission control center in Houston. ''Welcome back. It was a great way to finish a fantastic flight, Fergie.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts had hoped to land in Florida, where friends and family had gathered, but low clouds and high crosswinds from a cold front forced the flight director, Bryan Lunney, to wave off two landing opportunities. He briefly held open the option of keeping the astronauts in orbit an extra day and trying again for Florida on Monday. But forecasters concluded there was little chance the weather would improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flight surgeons were standing by to assist the outgoing space station flight engineer, Gregory E. Chamitoff, returning to the unfamiliar tug of Earth's gravity after six months aboard the space station. To ease his return to gravity, Dr. Chamitoff made the trip resting on his back in a recumbent seat on the shuttle's lower deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on board: More than a gallon of processed urine and condensate, the first samples from a newly installed water recycling system aboard the station that is a central element in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's plans for increasing the lab's crew size to six from three next May. At least three months of testing are required before station astronauts will be allowed to drink any recycled water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joining Captain Ferguson, Colonel Boe, Dr. Chamitoff and Mr. Pettit for the trip home were Capt. Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen, both of the Navy, and Lt. Col. Robert S. Kimbrough of the Army.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Endeavour delivered more than eight tons of equipment and supplies to the space station for what was dubbed an extreme home makeover, including the water recycling gear, a new toilet, a new galley, a refrigerator and two astronaut sleep stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While their crewmates worked inside the station, Captain Stefanyshyn-Piper, Captain Bowen and Colonel Kimbrough carried out four spacewalks to overhaul the space station's damaged right-side solar array rotary mechanism and to lubricate its left-side counterpart. They also installed a spare cooling system component, removed a spent nitrogen tank and prepared the Japanese Kibo lab module for attachment of an external experiment platform next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Endeavour also delivered Sandra H. Magnus, Dr. Chamitoff's replacement. Dr. Magnus will remain aboard the lab with Michael Fincke, the Expedition 18 commander and an Air Force colonel, and Yury Lonchakov, a cosmonaut and a colonel in the Russian air force, until the next shuttle visit in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has pushed back the launching of its next ambitious Mars mission by two years because of lengthening delays and lingering technical issues, agency officials announced Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mars Science Laboratory, a S.U.V.-size rover that is to explore the Martian surface for two years, is now set to be launched in 2011. It had been scheduled to lift off in September or October next year and arrive at Mars in 2010. With unsolved issues with some of the spacecraft's electrical motors, however, NASA officials no longer thought they could meet that schedule without rushing the testing program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've determined that trying for '09 would require us to assume too much risk, more than I think is appropriate for a flagship mission like Mars Science Laboratory,'' Michael D. Griffin, NASA's administrator, said at a news conference Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Earth and Mars come close to each other only once every 26 months, the next chance for launching is not until fall 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay comes at considerable cost. Originally approved at a cost of $1.63 billion in August 2006, the Mars Science Laboratory's budget has already swelled to $1.88 billion, and NASA officials said in October that they anticipated the mission needed another $200 million next year to meet the 2009 launch date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the delay, there is no need to spend the $200 million in 2009 to speed up the work. But the delay, with additional testing, will add $400 million, spread over several years, to the mission's cost, bringing the total to about $2.3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we can get by without canceling anything,'' Dr. Griffin said, although some missions will almost certainly be delayed. The cuts will first come out of the Mars research program, but other planetary missions may also be affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to find the least damaging way we can,'' Dr. Griffin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin said he did not consider cancelling Mars Science Laboratory. ''I would have to believe the project was going badly, in a technical sense,'' he said. ''It's not. It's going great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which is building the spacecraft, did not do a good job of estimating costs, Dr. Griffin said, but in terms of the technical work, ''Even in retrospect, they have not done anything wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Griffin noted some of NASA's most famous successes also suffered cost overruns. ''If we canceled everything on those grounds, we'd have never have finished Hubble,'' he said, referring to the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I worked on Hubble,'' he said. ''I always say I am proud to say that I worked on Hubble, and I am. But we didn't come within a factor of two. And does anybody today out there in the science community or those who watch the science community regret building Hubble?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward J. Weiler, the associate administrator for space sciences, said he has had some preliminary discussions with the European Space Agency about cooperating on future Mars missions, especially one that would bring some Martian rocks back to Earth. ''We will never ever do a sample return mission unless we work together,'' he said. ''This makes eminent sense to both of us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sample return mission likely would not occur until the early 2020s and would cost $6 billion to $8 billion.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers testing techniques to search for extraterrestrial life have detected carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet 63 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This carbon dioxide, though, is certainly not coming from plants or automobiles. The planet, HD 189733b, is far too large (about the mass of the Jupiter) and too hot (1,700 degrees Fahrenheit) for any possibility of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really a proof of concept of using CO2 as a biomarker,'' said Mark R. Swain, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who led the team that made the discovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings will appear in Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, astronomers including Dr. Swain's group reported finding water vapor and methane swirling around HD x189733b. And in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, a different group of astronomers, led by Carl J. Grillmair of the California Institute of Technology, now report that they, too, have detected water around the same planet, using a technique more precise than that used in earlier research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As seen from Earth, HD 189733b passes directly in front of and behind its parent star as it orbits. Taking advantage of those eclipses, Dr. Swain's group used the Hubble Space Telescope to compare the near-infrared light from the star alone (when the planet was hidden behind it) with the combined light from both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between the two spectrums revealed the light emitted from the planet, and the mix of colors in the planet's light contained the telltale signs of carbon dioxide at concentrations of between one part per million and one part per 10 million, compared with Earth at about 385 parts per million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that much carbon dioxide was a bit of a surprise, because the simplest chemistry equations predicted that carbon would prefer to form carbon monoxide or methane molecules. One possibility is that the intense ultraviolet radiation from the star, just three million miles away, is spurring chemical reactions to produce the observed carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The theorists will have no problem explaining it,'' said L. Drake Deming, a planetary scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and a member of Dr. Swain's team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the detection of water by Dr. Grillmair's team, using a similar technique but with longer-wavelength infrared emissions detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope, confirms what had been expected: hydrogen and oxygen are two of the most common elements in the universe, and they readily combine into water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This result basically confirms what the theoreticians have been saying for a number of years,'' Dr. Grillmair said. ''There should be a huge amount of water in these atmospheres, and it looks like there is.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Klaatu barada nikto, indeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking the ultimate red carpet, or perhaps a chance to get a good word in for humanity to whoever might be Out There watching, the makers of the new movie ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' have arranged for it to be beamed into space on Friday, on the same day the movie opens here on planet Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie, starring Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu, who comes to warn mankind to change its warlike ways or be destroyed, is of course a remake of the 1951 classic starring Michael Rennie. No official translation of them exists, but the words ''Klaatu barada nikto'' were sufficient in the original movie to save the Earth, or at least postpone its day of judgment from Klaatu's robot enforcer Gort. And they have been a touchstone of science fiction and alien sociology ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what better words to broadcast to the stars?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie will be broadcast in real time, starting at noon on Friday, by Deep Space Communications Network, a Florida company that has beamed whale songs and the <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> Web site, among other things, into space in the three years of its existence. According to its Web site, the company will transmit a five-minute signal into space for anyone for $299.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this case, Jim Lewis, Deep Space's director, said the company had to satisfy 20th Century Fox, the film's producers, that the transmission could not be intercepted and pirated on Earth or in the air. The movie will be beamed in the direction of Alpha Centauri, a triple star system about four light-years from here. That means it will take four years for it to get to Alpha Centauri. (There is plenty of time to get popcorn, whoever you are.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reviews will take longer to come back, if they ever do, and we could hope they are kinder than Klaatu's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an interstellar broadcast, the movie at least beats a Doritos commercial, which was broadcast into space by a set of European radar stations in June in the most recent high-profile space transmission. Whether it lives up artistically to the Beatles song ''Across the Universe,'' which NASA sent off in February as part of the agency's 50th anniversary, remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biologist and writer Lewis Thomas once suggested that if we were going to send anything to the stars, we send Bach. It would be bragging, he admitted, but we are allowed to put our best foot forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Television and radar signals have been leaking from the Earth out into space for most of a century, creating a bubble of football games, the Vietnam and Iraq wars, political conventions, quiz shows and ''Howdy Doody'' that is more than 100 light-years in diameter and growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That outpouring is one reason astronomers should not be perturbed about sending movies or commercials into space, said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., which is engaged, among other things, in searching for extraterrestrial signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've already advertised our presence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Shostak, who was a consultant for the new movie, is chairman of a committee of the International Academy of Astronautics devoted to SETI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some people, he acknowledges, who might worry that broadcasting ''The Day the Earth Stood Still'' could be inimical to our interests. He added, ''I think that if these people are truly worried about such things, they might best begin by shutting down the radar at the local airport.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same mystery force that is speeding up the expansion of the universe is also stunting the growth of the objects inside it, astronomers said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After bulking up rapidly in the first 10 billion years of cosmic time, clusters of galaxies, the cloudlike swarms that are the largest conglomerations of matter in the universe, have grown anemically or not at all during the last five billion years, like sullen teenagers who suddenly refuse to eat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This result could be explained as arrested development of the universe,'' said Alexey Vikhlinin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led a multinational team using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to weigh galaxy clusters from far across space. The group reported the results in a telephone news conference on Tuesday and in two papers that will appear in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This stifling of growth, Dr. Vikhlinin said, is the ''unmistakable signature'' of an antigravitational force that astronomers have labeled dark energy. It was discovered 10 years ago by astronomers who were using exploding stars called supernovas as distance markers to chart the expansion of the universe. They found that instead of slowing down because of cosmic gravity, as common sense would suggest, the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up, with galaxies zooming apart faster and faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Vikhlinin's results dovetail eerily with the supernova results. Clusters grow by gravity, according to cosmological theory, starting as small dimples in the heat and fizz of the Big Bang and then drawing in surrounding material over the eons. Dark energy would work against gravity and try to push the matter falling in back out, stalling growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with earlier observations, Dr. Vikhlinin said, the new data strengthen the suspicion -- but do not prove -- that dark energy is a weird antigravity called the cosmological constant that was hypothesized and then abandoned by Albert Einstein as a ''blunder'' almost a century ago. If that is true, the universe is fated to empty itself out eventually, and all but the Milky Way's closest neighbors will eventually be out of sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other astronomers hailed the work as a new avenue in the investigation of what is happening and will happen to the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To date, only one technique -- supernovae -- has detected dark energy without folding in other observations,'' said Michael Turner of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that two different methods have given similar results for dark energy is a triumph of Einstein's general theory of relativity, the last word on gravity for the last century, astronomers said. ''This was a test that general relativity could have failed,'' said William Forman of Harvard, a member of Dr. Vikhlinin's team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some dark energy explanations that involve modifying Einsteinian gravity may be on the verge of extinction as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins and the Space Telescope Science Institute, said: ''If this was a fox hunt and dark energy was the fox, I think they have closed off another escape route. But there is still a lot of terrain left for the fox, and we've seen little more than a glimmer of fur.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clusters of galaxies, which can contain thousands of individual galaxies, are perfect laboratories for studying gravity and its enemy, dark energy, on a grand scale. They are also easy to find. They are filled with gas so scorchingly hot that it emits X-rays, which can be seen by satellite observatories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Vikhlinin and his colleagues used Chandra to observe 86 clusters that had been found in a survey by an earlier satellite, Rosat. One was a set of 37 about five billion light-years away; 49 others were about half a billion light-years or closer. Their masses, determined from the extent of the X-ray images and their spectra, ranged from 100 trillion Suns to a quintillion Suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing their data to models of cosmic evolution, Dr. Vikhlinin found that the most massive clusters are only about a fifth as plentiful today as they would be in a universe without dark energy. The clusters, he said, ''are still growing, but very slowly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein speculated that empty space was imbued with an antigravitational energy -- his cosmological constant to explain why the universe was stable and did not collapse under its own gravity. But later Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe was not stable -- it was expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern quantum mechanics predicts that empty space should indeed be imbued with this strange energy, but the possibility that the dark energy might actually be Einstein's cosmological constant has thrown physics into philosophical turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the calculations, the cosmological constant should be 1060 times bigger than what astronomers have measured; in such a universe, stars, planets and of course ourselves could not exist. The only way out, some physicists and cosmologists argue, is to presume that our universe is only one of as many as 10500 parallel universes, in which the laws of physics happen to be conducive to our existence. But many others bitterly disagree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many astronomers and physicists are desperate for evidence of another explanation. Dr. Riess said of the cosmological constant, ''The biggest thing we could learn is by ruling that out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new cluster results, combined with other measurements of supernovas and of cosmic microwaves left over from the Big Bang, provide the tightest constraints yet on dark energy, Dr. Vikhlinin said. Its virulence, as measured by a parameter called w, is within 5 percent of the cosmological constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that still leaves a lot of wiggle room for other theories, and some astronomers worry that the measurements will never get accurate enough to prove or disprove the cosmological constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Spergel of Princeton said astronomers had to soldier on into the darkness. The universe has surprised us before, he said, and ''I think we will continue to be surprised in the future.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALTADENA, Calif. -- When space engineers made a map of a planet or a distant moon back in the old days, they made an 8-by-10 picture of part of the surface, identified a couple of landmarks -- a crater and an outcrop, say -- and measured the distance between them with a straightedge and a crayon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then you punched the number into the computer and figured out the latitude and longitude,'' recalled Robert W. Gaskell, a planet-mapping expert. The result was two-dimensional, with only hints of surface texture or complexity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more. With modern computers, digital photography and laser range-finding, scientists today do a much better job of pinpointing the locations of their spacecraft, picking landing sites and otherwise describing the solar system's extraterrestrial landscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And nobody does it better than Dr. Gaskell. With software he developed over a quarter-century of trial and error, he can process hundreds of images in a few hours, slap them atop one another electronically like coats of paint and produce a topographical map so detailed that you often need a pair of 3-D glasses to appreciate what he has done. At 63, Dr. Gaskell has become the Captain Cook of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He retired from the NASAJet Propulsion Laboratory in 2006 so he could make maps full time, and he now works in a computer-filled office at his home in this suburb northeast of Los Angeles. He is affiliated with the Planetary Science Institute, based in Tucson, but he gets his own grants and could be described as a freelancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just now Dr. Gaskell is mapping all of Mercury and eight moons of Saturn. He also has a NASA contract to do part of a topographical map of Earth's Moon, and he is working on a project to refine his model of the near-Earth asteroid Eros. He has made 12,000 overlay ''maplets'' of Eros from images produced by the NEAR spacecraft at the turn of the century. In all, NEAR made 160,000 digital images, and ''I'm doing 1,000 at a time,'' Dr. Gaskell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gaskell calls what he does ''stereophotoclinometry.'' Ideally he needs at least three images of the target landscape, usually taken by an orbiting spacecraft or a probe on a flyby to another destination. Only in rare cases can telescope images provide enough detail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sun angle must be different for each exposure so each image shows different shadows. By comparing the shadows, the software calculates slopes, which yield the altitudes of target features. The computer solves the equation in three dimensions, producing a patchlike topographical maplet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to create a 3-D model of an entire body. A first take can be done quickly, but more images and more maplets produce more overlap and overlay, sharpening the topography until the scientist runs out of pictures.Dr. Gaskell started working on Eros in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A graduate of McGill University with a Ph.D. in physics, Dr. Gaskell began his celestial mapmaking career in 1984, but it was 1989 before he got an inkling of what might be possible, using images from the Voyager spacecraft to study Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. He built his map by comparing the brightness of a feature in different images. He did not have enough computing power to pay attention to sun angles, but, he said, ''I intuitively knew that different illuminations could give more information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first of two ''aha!'' moments came around 1995, when he was using NASA's Viking images to map possible landing points on Mars. The images were taken with a variety of sun angles, and Dr. Gaskell realized ''in about a millisecond'' that with the computing power he now had, he could calculate slopes and, therefore, build topographies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He refined his technique, and in 2000 he used it to map Phobos, Mars's largest moon, so a Mars lander could use the map as a navigational aid. ''I had maybe 100 maplets,'' Dr. Gaskell said. ''But then I thought to myself, Why not do the whole thing? I could pick more points closer together and overlap the maplets. It wouldn't be any harder.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he did it. Phobos, it turned out, looks like an elongated, heavily cratered, opaque Idaho potato. Dr. Gaskell's first topographical model had 146 maplets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eros came next, and currently has 12,000 maplets. And in his last job for the jet propulsion lab, in 2005, Dr. Gaskell was seconded to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to build a topographical model of the asteroid Itokawa, another near-Earth object about 1,650 feet long, using images from the agency's Hayabusa spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is now working on Mercury, a project that does not look like much yet. Mariner 10 made three passes in 1974-75,but the sun angle was the same in all of them, so there is little variation in the exposures. The Messenger spacecraft has made two flybys, providing lots of new material but little overlap.Once the spacecraft settles into orbit around Mercury in 2011, however, Dr. Gaskell will have all the images he wants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He freely acknowledges he has more work than he can handle, and, far from jealously guarding his secrets, he is eager to teach others his technique. At this point Dr. Gaskell's software can integrate all kinds of information and make it look easy. It can use images at high resolution, images at low resolution, laser readings and even radar ranges from radio telescopes (for Itokawa).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His approach is unique,'' said the geophysicist Olivier Barnouin-Jha of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, a Gaskell collaborator on the Eros, Itokawa and Mercury projects. ''But it's not quite as nice as a black box. There's a lot of handholding and agonizing that goes into this.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty years ago today, the crew of Apollo 8 gave the planet what this page called ''an ennobling Christmas present.'' The astronauts -- Frank Borman, James A. Lovell Jr. and William A. Anders -- orbited the Moon, beaming pictures home in two live broadcasts, one in the morning and one later that evening. They read the first verses of Genesis, then signed off. ''Goodbye. Goodnight,'' Colonel Borman said. ''Merry Christmas. God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has been made of the well-timed solace that the broadcasts gave at the end of a horrific year. From Vietnam to the Middle East to the streets of Paris, Mexico City and across the United States, the view from the ground was bloody and bleak. But not the view from afar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To see the earth as it truly is,'' wrote Archibald Macleish on Page A1 of The Times, ''small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold -- brothers who know now they are truly brothers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ah, optimism. This page felt it keenly, likening Apollo 8 to the discoveries of fire and the wheel. Our editorial looked ahead to the moon landing in 1969, then to the building of moon bases that would be a steppingstone for manned voyages to the planets, ''even to distant Pluto.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hasn't worked out that way. Humans have outdone themselves with unmanned spacecraft, of course, sending probes far beyond distant Pluto. But manned space flight quickly went down a dead end, with an aptly named shuttle making trips to an orbital parking lot about 240 miles up. (Apollo 8's voyage to the Moon was 240,000 miles, one way).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">War, poverty, disease, genocide are still with us. Humans have not evolved beyond greed and foolishness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world may never again be able to gaze at its photo with awestruck wonder. But two startlingly fresh images of our planet come to mind. The first is the virtual globe that appears when you open <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth. The planet as information tool, waiting to fly you anywhere you choose. The other is a haunting image from the movie ''Wall-E'' of a brown husk left lifeless by consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real Earth seen from the Moon is surely as lovely as ever, even with thinner ice caps, smaller forests, fewer gorillas and tigers and a few billion more people. We are still brothers and sisters in the eternal cold, but increasingly connected by invisible threads, able to see -- and hear and understand -- one another as never before. That, at least, is reason for optimism.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE days are shorter, and the weekends chillier. What's a family to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey, kids! Let's go to a science museum!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right. It's hard enough to blast youngsters out of the house, considering the cocooning comforts of video games and ''SpongeBob Squarepants.'' And how can a museum compete with mall-encased movie houses or indoor arenas with batting cages and rock climbing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pretty well, it seems. Musty, hands-off museums of decades ago have been brought up to date, with varying degrees of success, to become child-friendlier, with plenty of interactivity and play areas for the smallest visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course the American Museum of Natural History, with its metallic path of dinosaurian evolution, and the New York Hall of Science in Queens, a brilliant funhouse of explorations, have embraced hands-on learning concepts for quite a while. And in Connecticut, the Bruce Museum in Greenwich has done some excavating of its own with a new exhibition, ''Digging for Dinosaurs,'' that lets children play paleontologist. But there's a lot to be said for those places that are a little less spectacular and a little more out of the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ucko, the deputy director of the division of learning at the National Science Foundation, said small was good. ''The bigger ones, because they're in bigger cities, tend to focus a lot on tourism,'' he said. ''The ones that are community based tend to have their focus on the local community,'' with exhibits that have a sense of place and regular programs and workshops ''that people will come back to frequently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sean Smith, director of government and public relations for the Association of Science-Technology Centers, said that these ''little gems'' offer ''really, really unique things to people -- if they take the trouble to go out and find them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows is a selection of museums in Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester and Nassau Counties. It is by no means exhaustive, but it does suggest the diverse nature of the museumgoing experience throughout the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery Museum of Bridgeport, a three-story structure with colorful brickwork against a concrete exterior, is like a lot of smaller museums these days that take in pre-packaged exhibits. This enables them to keep things moving. From May to September of this year, the museum was host to an exhibition about global positioning satellite navigation systems that consisted largely of a maze with puzzles that had to be solved, treasure-hunt style, to gain access to each new section. The current exhibit is ''How to Make a Monster: The Art and Technology of Animatronics,'' which gives visitors a behind-the-scenes look at how some of film's greatest monsters were created, allowing budding puppeteers to take, say, a Komodo dragon head through its paces. Photographs by Rachel Sussman of the oldest continuously living organisms on the planet, including predatory fungus and ancient bacteria, will also be on display until Jan. 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum is home to a Challenger Learning Center, one of about 50 centers around the nation dedicated to the memory of the crew of the space shuttle Challenger, where school groups and birthday party guests can take part in shuttle launch and mission simulations. Elsewhere in the museum, a video of ''The Dream Is Alive,'' a movie about the space shuttle, plays on a video screen. ''Moon Base Discovery'' is a lunar rover mockup and software that has you guide the vehicle as the video screen shows a shifting lunar landscape. Other exhibits describe light and sound and energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the permanent exhibitions within the museum show signs of age and hard use -- though none quite so noticeably as the forlorn potato battery on the third floor that had such shriveled specimens in the case that someone left a note reading, ''You need new po-ta-toes!'' (The potatoes have been replaced, many times since.) But there are also some fine old favorites, including a lovely Jacobs Ladder. This V-shaped spark generator is a special effects mainstay of old science fiction films -- and the delight, it seemed, of many a young visitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery also has a planetarium with a 30-foot dome and Spitz System 512 projector that has recently been joined by a digital movie projector that turns the full dome into a screen for films like ''Dawn of the Space Age,'' which is currently showing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery Museum, 4450 Park Avenue, Bridgeport; (203) 372-3521;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">discoverymuseum.org.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cradle of Aviation in Garden City, occupying a grand space at the old Mitchel Field air base by the Nassau Coliseum, opened in 2002 and soon ran into financial problems when the 400,000 expected visitors a year did not materialize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is nonetheless a stirring celebration of what, to many visitors, will be a surprisingly rich aviation heritage for Long Island. Dozens of lovingly restored craft reside there, including a 1928 sister ship of Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis (Lindbergh took off for Paris from nearby Roosevelt Field). The space age has a Long Island connection too, and the museum displays a lunar lander from the Apollo program -- made by a local corporation, Grumman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thoroughly documented exhibits await visitors, who can look with unease at the unappetizing packets of food that early astronauts took to space, and at the adhesive-edged plastic ''Apollo bags'' astronauts used to collect their solid waste. The museum also has an IMAX theater and a simulator ride that rocks and shakes while passengers watch a movie about chasing comets and the like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large team of guides are knowledgeable and helpful. Children were encouraged by a guide to lie down on a mockup of the wing of the first Wright flier and try out the odd, hip-shifting mechanism that steered the plane by warping the wings. Others marveled at the small size of the Sperry ball turret that gunners crammed themselves into to protect the bellies of the B-17 and B-24 bombers. And all got a kick out of the rocket display, in which visitors could hand-pump a lightweight air rocket and see how high they could launch it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An especially wonderful touch at the Apollo exhibit is the reproduction of a ''towing bill'' that Grumman sent to North American Rockwell, the maker of the Apollo command and service modules. Those who know their history -- or who have seen ''Apollo 13'' -- know that when the explosion crippled the modules, it was the propulsion controls of the Grumman-made lander that saved the crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joke invoice requests $312,421.24 for the service -- $4 for the first mile and $1 for each additional mile, with sleeping accommodations at $8 a night. It's a geeky, right-stuff joke that is perfect for this museum, which engagingly overlays its science and history with a sense of place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cradle of Aviation Museum, Charles Lindbergh Boulevard, Garden City; (516) 572-4111; cradleofaviation.org.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By no stretch of the imagination does the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City qualify as small -- ''It looks like an airport,'' said a young visitor as he walked into the expansive entryway -- but it revels in its Jersey roots, and bubbles with flash and fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum, which first opened in 1993 and reopened last year after a two-year renovation, is a scientific amusement park, with nearly 300,000 square feet of exhibition space devoted to broad topics like the environment, health and gadgetry. Interactivity is all around, with buttons to push and liquids that slosh and shake. At one station, a clear tube was filled with lightweight pellets; as sound was piped into the tube, the pellets danced and showed wave patterns. At another, an enormous disk filled with fluids could be turned to produce enchanting swirls. Those, in turn, could be used to discuss fluid dynamics or meteorology or physics as art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a drawback to this cavalcade, it is that these discussions don't often happen. There are few cards explaining what's going on, and docents can be scarce. The goal, clearly, is to serve as a jumping-off point for open-ended inquiry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are regular demonstrations, and a young staffer entranced her audience with a brief presentation involving a live tarantula, toad, snake and turtle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gallery showing the ecosystem of New Jersey nicely combined environmental issues with local flavor. ''Our Hudson Home'' not only includes tanks with horseshoe crabs, sea stars, sea urchins, hermit crabs and whelks, but also illustrates shipping containers from the nearby port and lets visitors manipulate a virtual crane to haul them around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And down by the lobby, there was a great exhibit -- ''Skyscraper!'' -- that plays on the fact that the museum itself affords gorgeous views of Manhattan's stunning skyline. Movie clips and commercials show the image of skyscrapers in popular culture, and displays describe the technologies that go into creating green buildings. There is a wind tunnel to sit in and a high-tech display with a time-lapse video of the construction of the New York Times building, controlled by sliding a large video screen along a chart showing the stages of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberty Science Center, Liberty State Park, 222 Jersey City Boulevard, Jersey City; (201) 200-1000; lsc.org.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hudson River Museum in Yonkers presents a surprising blend of natural history, art and architecture. The museum, which looks out over the Hudson, combines a modern building with Glenview, an 1870s mansion -- a little of this and a little of that, as local institutions tend to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hudson Riverama, with its gallery, fish tanks and extensive map of locations along the mighty river, you might catch a whiff of the musty odors of long-damp grass and fish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the art displays on the main two floors of the museum play on the institution's diverse nature; a recent traveling exhibition, ''Space Is the Place,'' combined paintings on a theme of interplanetary exploration with audio installations and other attention-grabbing pieces. The current exhibits focus on the works of the artists Whitfield Lovell, Andrew Stevovich and Red Grooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the museum's star attraction is the Andrus Planetarium, with its eye-catching Zeiss M1015 projector and spacious 40-foot dome. The projector is, in fact, a gorgeous device, an old-fashioned dumbbell with precisely arranged holes that provide a star map that can be adjusted to match the evening sky that night or any night past or future. On one visit, the operator and lecturer was a little apologetic to the group of about a dozen people who had gathered there. Saturn wouldn't be making an appearance that day. ''We're missing a light bulb,'' she said. She started the show and danced the stars and planets -- aside from that burned-out Saturn -- around the darkened dome, showing how planetary orbits can make those heavenly bodies seem to zigzag in the sky, and revealing the sights with a laser pointer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homey and a bit off the cuff, this is definitely not the Rose Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History. The presentation charms instead of awes. But it evokes a time when the skies were the best free show around.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has named the rocket Ares I, as in the god of war -- and its life has been a battle from the start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ares I is part of a new system of spacecraft being designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to replace the nation's aging space shuttles. The Ares I and its Orion capsule, along with a companion heavy-lift rocket known as the Ares V, are meant for travel to the Moon and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technical troubles have dogged the design process for the Ares I, the first of the rockets scheduled to be built, with attendant delays and growing costs. And in an age of always-on communication, instant messages and blogs, internal debate that once might have been part of a cloistered process has spilled into public view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics say there are profound problems with the design that render the Ares I dead on arrival, while other observers argue that technical complications crop up in any spacecraft development program of this scope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issues have become a focus of the members of the presidential transition team dealing with NASA, and the space program could undergo a transformation after Barack Obama takes office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his campaign, Mr. Obama expressed support for NASA and criticized the five-year gap between the scheduled end of the space shuttle program in 2010 and the planned debut of the first components of the new system, which NASA has given the overall name Constellation, in 2015. (During the pause in American flights -- a Bush administration plan to conserve money during the development process -- the United States will depend on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft for trips to the International Space Station.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA, which has a $17 billion annual budget and most likely would face higher expenses if the gap is to be narrowed and the new program kept on track, will be competing for money as the new administration faces urgent and expensive crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama transition team, in meetings and requests for information from NASA, contractors and others with a stake in the process, has asked whether increased financing can narrow the five-year flight gap by speeding development of the new spacecraft. The advisers have also asked what the costs and consequences might be of continuing to fly the shuttles for at least one or two additional flights, or even to keep flying them until the next system is ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team has also asked whether the development program is truly in trouble and, if so, whether the Ares I should be modified or replaced by rockets used by the Air Force to launch satellites, or the Ariane 5 rocket from Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some involved in developing the rockets have read volumes into the questions, a spokesman for the transition team, Nick Shapiro, said that ''the role of the agency review teams is not to make recommendations on any of the issues they are reviewing. They are fact-finding and preparing the full range of options for consideration by the incoming appointees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, tensions have increased between the incoming administration and the management of NASA, whose administrator, Michael D. Griffin, is fighting to keep the program on course. If he is not reappointed by Mr. Obama, his term will end Jan. 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Logsdon, a space historian at the Smithsonian Institution, said Mr. Griffin was fighting for a program ''which he's put his whole reputation on.'' On the other hand, Dr. Logsdon said, a new president needs to press and probe. ''Any administration making a choice that's going to last for a generation needs to make that choice for itself,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Direction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an enormous barnlike building at the Kennedy Space Center earlier this year, officials proudly showed off a prototype of the heat shield of the new Orion capsule, a rounded disc some 15 feet across. Startlingly large but oddly prosaic -- it looked like nothing so much as a gigantic muffin top -- it served as a powerful symbol for those at the space center. It meant the first pieces of test hardware were moving from computer screens to reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metal, as they say, is being bent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Bush announced the new direction for the space program in January 2004, nearly a year after the loss of the shuttle Columbia underscored the risks inherent in the spacecraft -- especially the potential for debris to strike it during launching. In 2005, NASA lifted the curtain on the Constellation program, with the Orion capsule that would ride on top of its rocket, Ares I, out of the way of launch debris. It would be capable of carrying six astronauts; Apollo held three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares rockets are very different -- both from the shuttle and each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ares I, uses as its first stage a lengthened solid rocket booster like the ones used by the shuttle. The second stage is a rocket that will burn liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, as the shuttle's main engines do. Atop the stack will sit the Orion capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first test of an unmanned Ares I could take place next summer. The test, however, will use a spacecraft that is very different from the Ares I to come. It will involve a solid rocket booster of the same length that the shuttle uses, and the second stage and capsule will be dummies. Four more test flights are scheduled before the rocket is used beginning in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares V is a much brawnier rocket designed to send equipment to the Moon and beyond. Its first stage includes two solid rocket boosters and a liquid-fueled set of six rocket engines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The design process has run into technical problems. Orion is far heavier than the Apollo capsule and weight issues have required redesigns of both the capsule and the rocket, further complicating technical issues. Engineers have also had to come up with ways to dampen potentially dangerous vibrations along the shaft of the rocket as the solid rocket engine empties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some inside the development program have complained that it is run with a my-way-or-the-highway attitude that stifles dissent and innovation. Jeffrey Finckenor, an engineer who left NASA this year, sent a goodbye letter to colleagues that expressed his frustrations with the program. ''At the highest levels of the agency, there seems to be a belief that you can mandate reality,'' he wrote, ''followed by a refusal to accept any information that runs counter to that mandate.'' The letter was posted to the independent NASA Watch Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Finckenor has refused to comment further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leroy Chiao, a retired astronaut who flew three shuttle missions and served aboard the space station, said that the 2004 announcement by Mr. Bush of NASA's new direction ''was a time of great optimism.'' Mr. Chiao is not involved with the Constellation project today, but he said it was clear from some of the leaked discussions that ''the program has not panned out as I, and the vast majority of people, had hoped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunny Assessments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials say the Constellation program is actually coming along well. In an interview in November, Mr. Griffin said, ''I can't imagine somebody thinks you're going to develop a new space transportation system and encounter no challenges.'' The ones NASA is encountering, he said, are ''routine in the extreme.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas R. Cooke, a leading space agency official on the Constellation program, told reporters this month that the weight and vibration issues were well on their way to being fixed. And Neil Otte, the launching chief engineer for the Constellation rockets, said that solving tough problems was what engineers did for a living. When they encounter a particularly difficult challenge, he said, their attitude is, ''Hey, it's starting to get fun now, and we're earning our money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the chorus of naysayers that has arisen online, and even within NASA, often has a favorite alternative in mind. There is momentum behind using Atlas and Delta rockets developed for satellite delivery, which proponents say could quickly be fitted with the Orion capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffin has proposed using satellite launchers for human flights in the past, a process known as ''human rating'' that involves upgrades to the safety and reliability of the craft. This year, he told French lawmakers that it would be a ''small step'' from today's French Ariane 5 rocket, which has launched a cargo craft to the International Space Station, to ''an independent European human spaceflight capability.'' But he opposes the plan to use the military rockets and has said that the switch would lead to delay and cost increases while risking safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otte said using military rockets would be far more complex than simply putting a capsule on top of off-the-shelf equipment. Rockets built for satellites would have to be extensively modified before putting humans aboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second group of engineers favors plans for a follow-up system, called Direct 2.0, that is drawn largely from old NASA plans that had been abandoned. Ross Tierney, a spokesman for the group pushing Direct 2.0, said, ''Let's have an independent review and check them all out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're confident of what the numbers are going to be, and that we'll come out on top,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that concept has gained few followers, and in April, Richard Gilbrech, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems at the time, testified before the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics that ''we can't justify, based on laws of physics, the performance'' claimed by the plan's proponents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward F. Crawley, a senior professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the Ares I was not perfect, but that when seen in the context of its use of components from the shuttle program, military systems and the coming Ares V, it was the product of sensible choices. ''I don't have any reason to believe there are major technical issues to block its success,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a new rocket ''is a hard thing,'' Dr. Crawley said, and initial test flights often end in embarrassment or even disaster because everything in a very complex system has to go right. ''It's one strike and you're out,'' he said. ''If you put every day of its development under a microscope, you'll find plenty of things to write about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Keep Flying or Not</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Obama decides what to do about space, he might also decide to narrow NASA's five-year flight gap simply by flying the space shuttles past the Bush administration's 2010 deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure has grown to keep the shuttles flying. In July, former Senator John Glenn of Ohio said in testimony before the House Science and Technology Committee that he favored flying the shuttles until the Constellation craft were ready to fly. ''I never thought I would see the day when the world's richest, most powerful, most accomplished spacefaring nation would have to buy tickets from Russia to get up to our station,'' said Mr. Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continuing shuttle flights has also been proposed by the New Democracy Project, a group with strong ties to John D. Podesta, a co-chairman of the Obama transition team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Griffin, though, such proposals threaten to scuttle the new space program by hijacking billions of dollars that could go to Constellation development. He also argues that the shuttle's considerable risks make it unsafe to continue flying it. In an interview in November, Mr. Griffin defended the program he has put in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''U.S. civil space policy, in terms of its goals, was headed in the wrong direction after the Nixon administration,'' he said. Today, with the nation talking about going back to the Moon, exploring near-Earth asteroids and even going to Mars, ''that's the right path for us to be investing in,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Crawley of M.I.T. said he would like to see a panel of ''unbiased and wise people'' under the new administration weigh NASA's plans against the alternatives while keeping in mind the broad range of budgetary, workforce and technical issues. ''I don't frankly know what the answer is,'' he said, ''but I know it's a lot closer and a lot more complicated answer than the one playing out in the media and the blogs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, Dr. Crawley said, get on with it. The space program's $17 billion annual budget is small in comparison with other elements of the nation's spending. But its payoff, he noted, can be big. If the new president seeks to stimulate the economy with ''domestic high-technology jobs that provide stable and rewarding employment,'' he said, ''space would be a well-placed investment.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DRAWINGS: Constellation: NASA is developing a new generation of spacecraft to replace its aging shuttle fleet and return astronauts to the Moon by 2020. The first spacecraft in the Constellation program is expected to be launched in 2015, five years after the scheduled end of the shuttle program.; ALTAIR LUNAR LANDER: A two-stage spacecraft, larger but similar in function to the Apollo lunar module used in 1969, will ferry four astronauts to the Moon's surface. The lander is currently in the conceptual stage.; ORION MODULE: Carried aloft by the Ares I rocket, Orion is designed to carry up to six astronauts to the International Space Station, or four on lunar missions. The module will also ferry astronauts back to Earth.; ARES I ROCKET: A two-stage rocket will carry Orion and its astronauts into Earth orbit. Orion will approach and dock with the space station, or, on lunar missions, rendezvous with the Altair lander for a combined flight to the Moon.; UPPER STAGE: After the separation of the first-stage rocket booster, Ares I's second stage will use a liquid-fueled engine to push Orion into Earth orbit.; SOLID ROCKET BOOSTER: The first stage of the Ares I is a solid rocket booster derived from those used to launch the shuttle. When its fuel is spent, the reusable booster separates and falls back to Earth.; REDUCING VIBRATION: Engineers have had to devise ways to dampen potentially dangerous vibrations along the rocket shaft. ; ARES V ROCKET: Now in early design stages, the unmanned Ares V will lift the Altair lunar lander or up to 207 tons of other cargo.; UPPER STAGE: For lunar missions, the Altair lander and the upper stage, also known as the Earth departure stage, will first dock with the manned Orion module in Earth orbit. Astronauts will then use the stage's liquid-fueled engine to propel the joined spacecraft to lunar orbit.; CORE STAGE: Six liquid-fueled engines will provide massive thrust. After separation, the core stage will burn up in the atmosphere.; SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS: Similar to the booster used by the Ares I, but with additional thrust.; How They Stack Up: Relative sizes of the Ares I and Ares V rockets, compared with the shuttle and with the Saturn V rocket of the Apollo program.(DRAWINGS BY FRANK O'CONNELL/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (Source: NASA)(D1)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has a flight gap coming. Can the private sector fill it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is planning to retire the shuttle fleet in 2010, but the next generation of spacecraft is not likely to be ready to fly astronauts to the International Space Station and beyond until 2015. During the pause in American flights, the United States will rely on Russia to get astronauts to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA has been sliding toward the gap, a collection of companies known as the new space industry has been growing up. But none are ready to step up to the task of getting astronauts to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best-known company, Virgin Galactic, has been in the headlines for years thanks to its founder, Sir Richard Branson. But the craft it plans to use, called SpaceShipTwo, is designed to reach only suborbital space in a simple up-and-down flight that will give space tourists a spectacular view and a few minutes of weightlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies are pushing toward orbit, however, and have NASA's support in doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space agency has jump-started two companies' plans to provide cargo services to the station with hundreds of millions of dollars in financing through its Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. Last week, NASA announced that <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span> of Hawthorne, Calif. and <span class="companylink">Orbital Sciences</span> of Dulles, Va., had won $3.5 billion in contracts to begin delivering cargo to the station by 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, has often declared himself a fan of letting the private sector take its place in space. In a speech this month, he said, ''NASA not only should, but must, pursue and nurture appropriate partnerships with the emerging commercial space sector when it is reasonably within the grasp of such firms to meet our needs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, plans to go even further than delivering supplies to the station. Its founder, Elon Musk, says that his rockets could help NASA fill the human flight gap as early as 2011. The company successfully launched a single-engine rocket design into orbit on its fourth try; it plans to launch the first of its larger, nine-engine rockets for station cargo deliveries in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview at the sprawling <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> headquarters building, where engineers and builders design and create almost every part of the rocket, Mr. Musk said his company was an expression of his deep belief that leaving Earth was the next phase of human existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that is important to the future of life itself is having a second planet where life can be sustained and grow,'' he said. His cargo rockets have been designed from the start to meet NASA's requirements for human spaceflight, including the 40 percent margin of safety that NASA demands on human-rated launching vehicles. (Satellite launchers are required to have a 25 percent margin of safety.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's only one significant thing missing'' to take the cargo craft to a crew ship, he said, ''and that is the escape tower,'' which could save the crew in the event of an emergency during launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, however, has yet to finance an initiative that would extend the present cargo contract to include human launchings. Mr. Griffin has signed long-term deals with the Russians to provide flights to the station past 2011, but in an interview in November, he said the agency could not stake its future on hopes that companies would develop a human-rated launching system by the time the shuttles were retired. While claiming that he is ''the biggest fan Elon has,'' he said, ''We can't plan the sustenance of the International Space Station and its crew of six around the gamble that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> will succeed by 2011.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech this month, he said that sending cargo to the station was ''our more critical need'' for sustaining the station, and that financing for launching people on private spacecraft was not in the cards any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear whether Mr. Griffin will remain the NASA administrator under the Obama administration. No matter who is in charge at NASA, however, international partners in the station look askance at the idea of using privately developed spacecraft to launch humans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marco Caporicci, an official with the European Space Agency's human spaceflight group, called the <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> pledge to put people in orbit so soon ''not realistic.'' He said that he could not imagine putting astronauts on ''an unproven system'' and that the company would have to go a long way to prove that its craft were safe and reliable. ''You know what it means to lose a shuttle crew,'' he said. ''No agency, no government, wants to go through that experience again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such talk infuriates those who have confidence in the private rockets under development. Charles Lurio, who publishes an online newsletter that chronicles the progress in the fledgling industry, said, ''It's absolutely loony to say there's some inherent law of the universe, or of performing the engineering of spaceflight, that says you have to have a government entity to be able to do it successfully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said he was pleased when people said he was attempting the impossible. He was a founder of <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, the online payments company, and people said creating such a payments system could not be done, too. Those who doubt his ability to reach his goal, he said, will be proved wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you'll see,'' he said, ''that they are going to temper their negativity as time goes by.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven astronauts slipped into unconsciousness within seconds and their bodies were whipped around in seats whose restraints failed as the space shuttle Columbia spun out of control and disintegrated in 2003, according to a new report from NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the astronauts' upper bodies flailed, the helmets that were supposed to protect them ended up battering their skulls, the report said, and ''lethal trauma occurred to the unconscious or deceased crew due to the lack of upper-body support and restraint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investigators state bluntly in the 400-page report that better equipment in the crew cabin would not have saved the astronauts on the morning of Feb. 1, 2003, as the Columbia disintegrated after re-entering the atmosphere on the way to its landing strip in Florida. ''The breakup of the crew module and the crew's subsequent exposure to hypersonic entry conditions was not survivable by any currently existing capability,'' they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They added, ''There is no known complete protection from the breakup event except to prevent its occurrence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report's goal, NASA officials said, is to provide a guideline for safety in the design of future spacecraft. In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, N. Wayne Hale, Jr., a former head of the shuttle program, said, ''I call on spacecraft designers from all the other nations of the world, as well as the commercial and personal spacecraft designers here at home, to read this report and apply these lessons which have been paid for so dearly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report reconstructs the crew's last minutes, including the warning signs that things were going badly wrong and alerts about tire pressure, landing gear problems and efforts by the computerized flight system to compensate for the growing damage. It listed five ''lethal events'' related to the breakup of the shuttle, including depressurization of the crew module, the forces of being spun, the exposure to vacuum and low temperatures of the upper atmosphere and impact with the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft went into a nauseating flat spin and the pilot, Cmdr. William C. McCool of the Navy, flipped switches in a futile effort to deal with the problems. The troubles came on so quickly that some crew members did not have time to finish putting on their gloves and helmets. The sudden loss of cabin pressure asphyxiated the astronauts within seconds, the investigators said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela A. Melroy, a shuttle commander and a leader of the study team, said in the conference call that ''the crew was doing everything they were trained to do, and they were doing everything right'' as disaster struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many details of the Columbia's last flight have long been known, this was the most extensive study ever performed on how the astronauts died and what could be done to improve the chances of survival in a future accident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the shuttle broke up during re-entry, its fate had been all but sealed during ascent, when a 1.67-pound piece of insulating foam broke away from an external fuel tank and struck the leading edge of the craft's left wing. The foam punched a hole that would later allow superheated gases to cut through the wing's interior like a blowtorch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the foam was obvious in videos taken at launching, and during the Columbia's 16-day mission, NASA engineers pleaded with mission managers to examine the wing to see if the blow had caused serious damage. The managers, however, held firm to the then-common belief that foam strikes were relatively harmless and constituted a maintenance problem, not a fatal risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a scathing report issued in August 2003, an investigative board later found that a ''broken safety culture'' at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was largely responsible for the deaths. It criticized managers as complacent and too tightly focused on scheduling and budgetary pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the accident, NASA redesigned the shuttle's external fuel tank and greatly reduced the amount of foam that is shed during launching, among other physical changes to the shuttle. After the accident investigation board report came out, NASA also appointed the crew survival study group, whose report can be found at www.nasa.gov[http://www.nasa.gov]. The shuttle fleet is set to be retired in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA says it has already incorporated many lessons from the Columbia accident in the design of its next-generation space travel system, known as Constellation. The capsule design is hardier than the delicate, airplane-like shuttle, and rides on top of the rocket, out of the range of launching debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has called for upgraded seat hardware to provide more restraint, and individual radio beacons for the crew. Pressure suits will have helmets that provide better head protection, and equipment and new procedures will ensure a more reliable supply of oxygen in emergencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Melroy noted that those who died aboard the Columbia were friends and colleagues, and that many on the study team believed that ''learning the lessons of Columbia would be a way for all of us to work through our grief.'' At the same time, she said, ''this is one of the hardest things I've ever done, both technically and emotionally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing that the astronauts had lost consciousness before conditions reached their worst, she said, ''is a very small blessing -- but we will take them where we can find them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was released over the holidays, she said, so that the children of the astronauts would not be in school, and would be able to discuss the report with their parents in private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commander for the Columbia's last flight was Col. Rick D. Husband of the Air Force. Besides Commander McCool, the crew included Ilan Ramon, a colonel in the Israeli Air Force; Lt. Col. Michael P. Anderson of the United States Air Force; Kalpana Chawla, an aerospace engineer; and two Navy doctors, Capt. David M. Brown and Cmdr. Laurel Salton Clark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jonathan B. Clark, Commander Clark's husband, said in an interview that he was pleased with the investigation, which he worked on as a former NASA flight surgeon. ''It will make an important contribution,'' he said, adding that the most important thing was to understand the accident and not simply grieve. ''If you don't learn from it,'' he said, ''what a tragedy.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter wrapped up its two-year primary science phase, and Mars geologists are wallowing in a bounty of data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Technically and scientifically, it has certainly met our expectations,'' said Alfred S. McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and principal investigator for the orbiter's high-resolution camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Images taken by the camera, able to see features down to about a yard in size, have revealed details like rippled textures in what had looked like bland dusty regions, and researchers can now count tiny craters, enabling them to better estimate the age of terrains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sensitive spectrometer discovered rocks made of carbonate minerals, which may have formed when young Mars possessed a more benign environment: wet and maybe warm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's telling us something about the early history of Mars,'' said Scott L. Murchie of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and principal investigator for the spectrometer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the carbonates were washed away by acidic waters in later epochs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The orbiter will continue its observations, which will allow places to be photographed more than once to capture changes in the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the two Martian rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, mark their fifth anniversary this month, far outliving their original three-month mission. Spirit has recently begun moving again after sitting still through the winter while Opportunity is crossing the plains en route to a 13.7-mile-wide crater named Endeavour, a journey that could take at least another two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven W. Squyres, the principal investigator of the rovers, said it struck him as an odd milestone for people to mark. ''It's kind of like celebrating your birthday in Mars years,'' he said. ''Of course, I'd be younger that way.'' (In Mars years, Dr. Squyres is 28.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that Andromeda, previously thought to be the biggest galaxy in this part of the universe, may not have bragging rights over the Milky Way after all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Monday that the Milky Way is more massive than earlier known, given new measurements showing that the Sun is moving at 600,000 miles per hour around the center of the galaxy, or 100,000 m.p.h. faster than past calculations suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher speed of the Sun means the galaxy must have more mass -- about 50 percent more -- so as to generate a stronger gravitational pull to keep hold of the Sun, as well as all its other stars. That expands the Milky Way to roughly the heft of Andromeda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought we were like a little sister of Andromeda,'' said a member of the research team, Mark J. Reid, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ''Now we're like fraternal twins.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Determining the shape, size and mass of the Milky Way is difficult. Most of the mass is in the form of invisible dark matter, a component that far outweighs the ordinary matter in stars and gas clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomers, who reported their findings in Long Beach, Calif., at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, used the Very Long Baseline Array, a system of 10 radio telescopes stretching from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands. The team looked at bright, star-forming regions within the Milky Way, then measured the motion of those regions against the background of far more distant objects as the Milky Way rotated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second finding, another team of astronomers found something surprising at the center of the Milky Way: baby stars, still in the process of coalescing out of dust and gas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have known of young stars near the gigantic black hole at the center of the Milky Way, some 28,000 light-years from Earth, but there has been a mystery as to how they got there. The tidal forces induced by the black hole would rip gas clouds to shreds before they could coalesce and collapse into stars, astronomers believed. Yet it also seemed unlikely that so many stars would have formed elsewhere and then pulled inward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using a radio telescope array in New Mexico, Elizabeth M. L.

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>679 words</div><div>16 January 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2003, a plume of methane gas rose from the surface of Mars. The big unanswered question is, What belched?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subsurface Martian cows are highly unlikely. But scientists are seriously considering the possibility of bacteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of researchers reported Thursday that the bursts of methane originated from three specific regions in the planet's northern hemisphere, where it was midsummer. The gas came out at a rate of 0.6 kilograms a second, the scientists said, and the plume contained 19,000 metric tons of methane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the first definitive detection of methane on Mars,'' Michael J. Mumma of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., the leader of the research team, said at a news conference, ''and the first definitive maps and identification of active regions of release.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings appeared in a paper published online Thursday by the journal Science. Dr. Mumma said additional scientific papers describing other time periods of the observations, which span from 2001 to last year, were being prepared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Methane -- the simplest of hydrocarbon molecules, with one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms -- is fragile in air. It falls apart when hit by ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. That means any methane in the Martian air must be recent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the presence of methane was reported in 2004 by three teams of scientists, the findings generated surprise and skepticism because only a few explanations seemed to be plausible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One was geothermal chemical reactions involving water and heat in volcanoes or underground hot springs. But evidence for recent volcanism on Mars is scarce. Also, volcanoes would be expected to spew other gases like sulfur dioxide, and those are not plentiful in the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second possibility is biological. On Earth, a class of bacteria known as methanogens breathes out methane as a waste product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's current Mars strategy is to look for signs of water and perhaps life in the planet's distant past. ''Perhaps we need to also think in terms of present-day life holding on somewhere in the subsurface,'' said Lisa M. Pratt, a professor of geological sciences at Indiana University who participated in the news conference but was not involved with the research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the source turns out to be geological in origin or to have come from long-extinct bacteria, the sites would still be prime locations to look for other microbes that thrive on methane as food. ''It gives us a bull's-eye to go after,'' Dr. Pratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the difficulty in measuring methane, many scientists wondered if the earlier reports really showed methane or if all three teams had been misled by their data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Mumma's group used telescopes in Hawaii to examine the light reflected off Mars. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light, and the scientists reported seeing black lines in the spectrum corresponding to methane and to water vapor. As Mars rotated, bringing different areas into view of the telescope, the scientists could measure variations in the concentrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concentrations in 2003 were densest over three regions -- known as Terra Sabae, Nili Fossae and Syrtis Major -- and as high as 45 parts per billion. The scientists said that mineralogy of the surface suggested these areas had flowing water in the far Martian past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nili Fossae had been under consideration for the landing site for NASA's next surface rover, the Mars Science Laboratory, but was not among the four finalists announced in November. Last month, scientists reported that the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had spotted exposed outcrops of carbonate rocks in Nili Fossae, perhaps the vestige of ancient lakes and seas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the news conference, Michael Meyer, the lead scientist for the Mars program at NASA headquarters, said that a recent decision to delay the launching of the rover to 2011 from 2009 could allow reconsideration of Nili Fossae. An instrument aboard the science laboratory would be able to detect methane at levels of 100 parts per trillion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the 1,800th Martian day of its mission, NASA's Spirit rover blanked out, and it remains a bit disoriented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., reported Wednesday that the Spirit had behaved oddly on Sunday -- the 1,800th Sol, or Martian day, since Spirit's landing on Mars in January 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(A Martian Sol is 39.5 minutes longer than an Earth day. The Spirit and its twin, the Opportunity, were designed to last just 90 Sols each, but both continue to operate more than five years later.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that day, the Spirit acknowledged receiving its driving directions from Earth, but it did not move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More strangely, the Spirit had no memory of what it had done for that part of Sol 1800. The rover did not record actions, as it otherwise always does, to the part of its computer memory that retains information even when power is turned off, the so-called nonvolatile memory. ''It's almost as if the rover had a bout of amnesia,'' said John Callas, the project manager for the rovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another rover system did record that power was being drawn from the batteries for an hour and a half. ''Meaning the rover is awake doing something,'' Dr. Callas said. But before-and-after images showed that the Spirit ended the day exactly where it started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, mission controllers told the Spirit to orient itself by locating the Sun in the sky with its camera, and it reported that it had been unable to do so. Dr. Callas said the camera did actually photograph the Sun, but it was not quite in the position the rover expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hypothesis is that a cosmic ray hit the electronics and scrambled the rover's memory. On Tuesday, the rover's nonvolatile memory worked properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spirit now reports to be in good health and responds to commands from Earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars Spirit rover may be driving again as soon as this weekend, but engineers remain perplexed about what caused it to lose its memory on Sunday and abort an attempted drive. Engineers are also investigating a second, apparently unrelated glitch: The rover thinks the Sun's position in the sky is four degrees off from the actual position. Analysis ruled out a problem with the camera. The prime suspect for the mismeasured tilt is the rover's gyroscopes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEHRAN -- Iran has fired a satellite into orbit and a shot across the bow of American diplomacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its first orbital launching, announced Tuesday, coincided with celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and raised concerns in the United States and other countries about Iran's potential use of long-range missiles to send warheads halfway around the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rocket apparently went up late Monday night or early Tuesday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weapons experts agreed that the act was mainly a symbolic accomplishment because the satellite was very small. Launching a heavy warhead intercontinental distances would require a far more powerful missile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching comes as President Obama has struck a conciliatory tone toward Tehran, suggesting that he will move toward dialogue after years of tensions. Even so, he may take a tough line in the coming months and could seek to tighten sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In using its own rocket to launch the satellite, Iran joined eight other nations that have used their own technologies to send objects into orbit. Amateur observers have already spotted the bright craft in the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the face of world opposition and sanctions, Iran has joined a very exclusive club,'' said Geoffrey E. Forden, a missile expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He called the step a genuine ''technological feat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States and other Western nations suspect that Tehran wants to develop nuclear arms, an accusation Iran's leaders deny. On Iranian television, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad praised the launching. ''Dear Iranian nation,'' he said, ''your children have placed the first indigenous satellite into orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He stressed that it was Iranian experts who had built the satellite and the rocket. ''With God's help and the desire for justice and peace,'' he said, ''the official presence of the Islamic republic was registered in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, the State Department called the event worrisome. ''Iran's development of a space launch vehicle establishes the technical basis from which Iran could develop long-range ballistic missile systems,'' said Robert A. Wood, a department spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aerospace experts said the action had a number of potential military implications, even though the satellite was small and lightweight compared with a nuclear warhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space in 1957, the action shook the world mainly because of the relatively fine technical line that exists between rockets that can launch spacecraft into orbit and those that can loft warheads over long distances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aerospace experts said Iran had now taken a significant step down that road. Its launching of the satellite took many years of preparation and required the mastery of staging -- the art of creating a multistage rocket that drops stages, and thus weight, as it races ever higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the experts said the step represented no immediate military threat and no reason to rush the deployment of antimissile arms in Europe, which the Bush administration sought to counter the threat of Iranian missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is no reason to panic,'' Charles D. Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview. ''It shouldn't force us to make a missile defense decision in Europe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Iran's action had more to do with sending a message to Washington and asserting influence as a regional power than with achieving a new military capability. ''It's a way for the Iranian people to stand proud,'' he said, ''but to do it in a way that is still within a civilian program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Iran, state-run television showed images on Tuesday of the liftoff of the rocket carrying the satellite, which is called Omid, meaning hope. IRNA, the official news agency, reported that it went into orbit as a data-processing project and was ''the first practical step toward acquiring space technology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles P. Vick, an expert on Iranian rockets at a private research group, GlobalSecurity.org, in Alexandria, Va., said the launching was a major accomplishment after years of delays, failures and setbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've been at this game for about five years,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States and other governments have been carefully monitoring Iran's efforts to develop more powerful missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iranian rocket had two stages, Mr. Vick said. If it were carrying a small warhead, he said, the Iranian missile could fire the weapon about 2,500 kilometers, or slightly more than 1,550 miles. The rocket could send a weapon to targets in Israel, but experts said that Iran had already possessed that capability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That falls short of the range of an intercontinental ballistic missile, Mr. Vick said. For Iran to achieve that technical step, he added, it would have to develop a more powerful basic rocket or more upper stages -- two goals that weapons experts think it is pursuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ferguson of the Council on Foreign Relations said that Iran's technical advance, if translated into a military missile, might put a warhead within range of southern Europe, including Turkey, Greece and Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Iran has a reputation for technical legerdemain, experts agree that the satellite launching was genuine. Dr. Forden of M.I.T. said amateur observers around the world had tracked its starlike twinkling and listened to its radio signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the satellite's trajectory was taking it as high as a 55-degree-north latitude and that the small spacecraft was visible from all of the continental United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts said the United States was closely tracking two objects: the satellite and the rocket's second stage, which also went into orbit. A commercial Web site, Real Time Satellite Tracking, n2yo.com/?s=33506, features what it calls a ground track showing the satellite's movements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nations that have previously managed to loft satellites into orbit are Russia, the United States, France, Japan, China, Britain, India and Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, Tehran's efforts to build a fleet of large rockets, and to buy and make satellites, have received technical help from Russia, China, India, Italy and North Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aerospace experts said Iran's growing fleet of rockets had drawn most heavily on aid from North Korea. Mr. Vick of GlobalSecurity.org said the first and second stages of the rocket that had lofted the satellite were based on North Korean designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iran has come under increasing pressure from the West over its efforts to enrich uranium. The United Nations Security Council has imposed three sets of sanctions on Iran, including missile-related embargos, and has called on it to suspend its enrichment activities. Iran has refused and insists that the effort is for peaceful, civilian purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Davoud Hermidas Bavand, a political analyst and professor of international law at Allameh Tabatabaee University in Tehran, said the satellite launching could elevate Iran's status and might lead to a change of tone toward Iran's nuclear program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their success shows that Iran has achieved a major technological progress,'' he said in an interview. ''It is also a matter of prestige for Iran because it has joined the space club, which has very few members.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iranian engineers began building the satellite in February 2006, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported, and it was ready for tests after two years. It said the communications satellite weighed just 27 kilograms, or about 60 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Israel, Yiftah Shapir, an expert on ballistic missiles and space technology at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, played down the launching as an event that was expected and had little military significance. The Iranians ''already have missiles that can reach Israel,'' he said. So for at least one country, he added, this was ''nothing new.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to capturing detailed shots, a single lens can fall short, especially if you're looking to enter gigapixel territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the same technology that the Mars exploration rovers relied on to gather their panoramic images, GigaPan Systems has created the GigaPan Epic, which lets photographers take detailed, high-resolution panorama shots with a standard point-and-shoot digital camera.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Epic is a small robotic mount that automates the picture-taking process when you attach a camera to it and specify the boundaries of your landscape. The images are then downloaded to your computer, where the GigaPan Stitcher software automatically combines them into a panorama, and the GigaPan Viewer -- to the delight or dismay of the people photographed -- can be used to zoom in on individual faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GigaPan Epic has already been used to capture a 1,474-megapixel panorama of President Obama's inaugural address as well as panoramas of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Union Station in Washington.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, space experts have warned of orbits around the planet growing so crowded that two satellites might one day slam into one another, producing swarms of treacherous debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened Tuesday. And the whirling fragments could pose a threat to the International Space Station, orbiting 215 miles up with three astronauts on board, though officials said the risk was now small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a first, unfortunately,'' Nicholas L. Johnson, chief scientist for orbital debris at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said of the collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It happened some 490 miles above northern Siberia, at around noon Eastern time. Two communications satellites -- one Russian, one American -- cracked up in silent destruction. In the aftermath, military radars on the ground tracked large amounts of debris going into higher and lower orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing to this extent'' has ever happened before, Mr. Johnson said. ''We've had three other accidental collisions between what we call catalog objects, but they were all much smaller than this,'' the objects always very small and moderate in size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communication satellites, he added, ''are two relatively big objects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American satellite was an Iridium, one of a constellation of 66 spacecraft. Liz DeCastro, corporate communications director of <span class="companylink">Iridium Satellite</span>, based in Bethesda, Md., said that the satellite weighed about 1,200 pounds and that its body was more than 12 feet long, not including large solar arrays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, the company said that it had ''lost an operational satellite'' on Tuesday, apparently after it collided with ''a nonoperational'' Russian satellite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although this event has minimal impact on Iridium's service,'' the statement added, ''the company is taking immediate action to address the loss.'' The company's hand-held phones can be used anywhere around the globe to give users voice and data communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said the Russian satellite was presumably nonfunctional. Officials at the Russian Embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said the United States military's tracking radars had yet to determine the number of detectable fragments. ''It's going to take a while,'' he said. ''It's very, very difficult to discriminate all those objects when they're really close together. And so over the next couple of days we'll have a much better understanding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a minimum, Mr. Johnson added, ''I think we're talking many, many dozens, if not hundreds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debris could threaten the space station and its astronaut crew, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are actually debris from this event which we believe are going through space station altitude already,'' he said. The risk to the station, Mr. Johnson added, ''is going to be very, very small.'' In the worst case, he said, ''We'll just dodge them if we have to. It's the small things you can't see that are the ones that can do you harm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, International Space Station controllers have often adjusted its orbit to get out of the way of speeding space debris, which can move so incredibly fast that even small pieces pack a destructive wallop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Yembrick, a NASA spokesman in Washington, said the agency now judged the risk of collision with the speeding fragments to be ''very small.'' The threat, he added, is defined and acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson, who works at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the new swarms of whirling debris might also eventually pose a threat to other satellites in an orbital chain reaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're doing now is trying to quantify that risk,'' he said. ''That's a work in progress. It's only been 24 hours. We put first things first,'' meaning the station and preparing for the next shuttle mission.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to know whether to be more concerned about the debris spewed into orbit by the collision of two satellites last week or by the fact that no one was able to predict the collision before it happened. Neither bodes well for the long-term safety of space operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An American communications satellite owned by the Iridium network and a no-longer-functioning Russian communications satellite slammed into each other 490 miles above northern Siberia in what appears to be the first collision between two intact satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of fragments were strewn into space, where they will pose at least a small additional hazard to other satellites or spacecraft that move through the area. The international space station, orbiting 215 miles up with three astronauts aboard, will face an elevated but still very small risk of being struck by space debris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who thought that our nation's space tracking systems could see such things coming will be surprised to learn that there are gaps in coverage and capabilities. The military does indeed track some 19,000 objects in space, including active and nonfunctioning satellites, hordes of debris fragments, and thousands of unknown objects that might threaten the safety of American satellites. It publishes their coordinates and velocity in a catalog on a Web site that anyone can view free of charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the military doesn't calculate all possible collisions. It lacks the computing power, trained personnel and sensor capabilities to pull off that feat. Instead, it focuses primarily on potential collisions that might endanger the space station and shuttles, its own satellites and those of other federal agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A private company fills part of the gap by assessing potential collision threats to other active satellites on a daily basis. It publishes a top 10 list of likely close encounters. As it turned out, the satellite that was demolished did not make the top 10 list that day, partly because other satellites looked even more likely to pass close to debris and partly because these calculations are inherently imprecise. Iridium, which is ultimately responsible for its own satellites, apparently had no clue that one of them was about to be smashed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new debris adds to the growing amount of junk accumulating in orbit. Thus far the annoying objects have not had a major impact on human or robotic missions into space, but there are grave concerns for the future. At some cluttered altitudes, collisions are producing debris faster than gravity can eliminate it. If the trend is not reversed, one can imagine a time when it could be too risky or too expensive to fly spacecraft through the debris fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United Nations has adopted voluntary guidelines to minimize the creation of new space debris. It recommends such steps as designing spacecraft so that no debris is released during normal operations, removing leftover propellants at the end of a mission and moving nonoperational satellites out of congested orbits. A U.N. meeting in Vienna this month will assess how well that effort is going. The looming problem yet to be addressed is how to get rid of the debris and objects already up there and proliferating with every collision.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STANFORD, Calif. -- For 46 years, Francis Everitt, a Stanford University physicist, has promoted the often perilous fortunes of Gravity Probe B, perhaps the most exotic, ''Star Trek''-ish experiment ever undertaken in space. Finally, with emergency financial help from a pair of unusual sources, success is at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conceived in the late 1950s, financed by $750 million from NASA and launched into orbit in 2004, the Gravity Probe B spacecraft has sought to prove two tenets of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The first, called the geodetic effect, holds that a large celestial body like Earth will warp time the way a rubber sheet stretches when a bowling ball is placed on it. The second, known as frame-dragging, occurs when the rotation of a large body ''twists'' nearby space and time; turn the resting bowling ball, and the rubber sheet twists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To measure these phenomena, Dr. Everitt and his Stanford team equipped Gravity Probe B with a special telescope attached to several gyroscopes. They pointed the telescope at a ''guide star,'' IM Pegasi, and then spun up the gyros with their axes also fixed on the guide star. If Einstein was right, the gyros would drift slightly over time to follow the space-time distortion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stanford team collected 11 1/2 months' worth of transmissions from Gravity Probe B, but tiny unforeseen drift in the gyros fouled the results. Dr. Everitt had to ask NASA for extra time and money so his 11-member team could figure out how to scrub the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four painstaking years later, the team has confirmed the geodetic effect and put a credible frame-dragging result within reach. Nevertheless, NASA was forced to stop financing the project last May. This 11th-hour catastrophe might have been terminal, but Dr. Everitt, long known for his tenacity as well as his charm, had nursed Gravity Probe B through several near-death experiences over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To persevere into 2008, he had already won a $500,000 contribution from Richard Fairbank, the founder and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Capital One Financial</span> and the youngest son of his old mentor, the Stanford physicist William Fairbank. Richard Fairbank stipulated that Stanford and NASA each match his contribution, and they did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by mid-2008, that $1.5 million was running out. That is when Dr. Everitt turned to Turki al-Saud, vice president for research institutes at the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia and a member of the Saudi royal family. Dr. Saud, who has a doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford, arranged a $2.7 million grant. The work goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't imagine I would ever visit Riyadh,'' Dr. Everitt said. ''We will need more money, but $2.7 million by itself is really helpful. We now have a clear end in sight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gravity Probe B experiment was conceived at the dawn of the Space Age by the Stanford physicist Leonard Schiff and George E. Pugh of the Defense Department. Dr. Schiff brought William Fairbank into the project in 1959, and in 1962 Dr. Fairbank induced the British-born Dr. Everitt to come for a visit. Now 74, Dr. Everitt has directed Gravity Probe B ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the experiment itself was relatively straightforward, the engineering demands were unprecedented. The theoretical distortion in space-time for the geodetic effect was 6,614.4 milliarcseconds per year; for frame-dragging it was only 14 milliarcseconds per year. A milliarcsecond is about one four-millionth of a degree of arc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make measurements that fine using an object as large as Earth, the spacecraft's gyros had to be virtually friction-free and unaffected by heat, magnetic fields or unpredictable movements. The pristine environment of space made the attempt possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But success was not guaranteed. Arcane, often unprecedented technologies were needed. The four fused-quartz, Ping-Pong-ball-size gyroscopes, coated with the metal niobium, were the most perfectly spherical objects ever created by humans. A coffin-size lead ''bag'' shielded the gyros from Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large thermos-like container called a dewar contained 645 gallons of liquid helium to be cooled to within two degrees of absolute zero. The helium held the niobium coating at superconducting temperatures, so the metal could track the deviations in the gyros' spin axis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the 21-foot-long, 3-ton spacecraft was launched on April 20, 2004, Gravity Probe B had become a very expensive tool designed to prove something that many scientists over the years had come to accept as already proved by theoretical physics and some previous experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That argument has no heft with Dr. Everitt. ''We are doing a measurement with a massive object, and this is valid,'' Dr. Everitt said. ''This is what the general theory of relativity says, and this is the experiment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission, however, did not go according to plan. The niobium coating on the gyros and their housings was slightly uneven, causing tiny unpredictable electrical torques that made the gyros drift. The mission ended in 2005, but since then the Stanford team has been mapping niobium anomalies on each gyro, finding the patterns of distortion and subtracting the noise from the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had budgeted money for a year's worth of post-flight data analysis, but Dr. Everitt needed a lot more time, and NASA financed the project through 2007. That, it seemed, would be the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Fairbank, whom Dr. Everitt had known since he was a child, thought differently. ''Nearly 50 years ago, my father had talked with me about the integrity of a bold quest and never giving up,'' Mr. Fairbank said. ''I just felt that the project was on the 1-yard line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing brought about by his contribution took the project into 2008, but in May, Gravity Probe B went before NASA's senior review, where an independent committee of scientists rates continuing agency projects to determine financing priorities. ''We ended up dead last,'' Dr. Everitt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That month, however, Dr. Saud visited Stanford and spoke briefly with Dr. Everitt. Saudi Arabia, which has built 12 small satellites, ''was interested in forming partnerships'' for future space missions, Dr. Saud said in a telephone interview, and has since done so with Stanford and NASA. Dr. Everitt met with Dr. Saud in London in July, and Gravity Probe B received $2.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team has forged ahead. In August, graduate students made a breakthrough in data analysis to bring the frame-dragging deviation within 15 percent of the predicted result. Dr. Everitt hopes to get it within 3 percent by mid-2010. The geodetic effect is currently within 1 percent of the predicted result and is expected to go even lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They fly the mission and have what seems like an insurmountable problem,'' said Michael Salamon, program scientist for the Physics of the Cosmos Program at NASA and a staunch supporter of the project despite the senior review decision. ''Then they do this. It's spectacular, frankly, and when it's done we are going to have a press announcement.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials again postponed the launching of the next space shuttle mission to investigate further a nagging engineering concern. During the last mission, of the Endeavour in November, a piece broke off a valve that regulates the flow of hydrogen gas from the main engines to the external tank to maintain pressurization of the tank. Shuttle officials had sought to set a launching date for next Friday during a flight readiness review meeting that started in the afternoon and stretched well into the night. But lingering unease led them to decide to perform more analysis before revisiting the issue next week. The mission of the Discovery, originally scheduled for Feb. 12, had already been pushed back several times.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someday it might be said that this was the beginning of the end of cosmic loneliness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presently perched on a Delta 2 rocket at Cape Canaveral is a one-ton spacecraft called Kepler. If all goes well, the rocket will lift off about 10:50 Friday evening on a journey that will eventually propel Kepler into orbit around the Sun. There the spacecraft's mission will be to discover Earth-like planets in Earth-like places -- that is to say, in the not-too-cold, not-too-hot, Goldilocks zones around stars where liquid water can exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job, in short, is to find places where life as we know it is possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not E.T., but it's E.T.'s home,'' said William Borucki, an astronomer at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in California, who is the lead scientist on the project. Kepler, named after the German astronomer who in 1609 published laws of planetary motion that now bear his name, will look for tiny variations in starlight caused by planets passing in front of their stars. Dr. Borucki and his colleagues say that Kepler could find dozens of such planets -- if they exist. The point is not to find any particular planet -- hold off on the covered-wagon spaceships -- but to find out just how rare planets like Earth are in the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, director for astrophysics at NASA headquarters, calls Kepler the first planetary census taker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler's strategy is, in effect, to search for the shadows of planets. The core of the spacecraft, which carries a 55-inch-diameter telescope, is a 95-million-pixel digital camera. For three and a half years, the telescope will stare at the same patch of sky about 10 degrees, or 20 full moons, wide, in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra. It will read out the brightnesses of 100,000 stars every half-hour, looking for the telltale blips when a planet crosses in front of its star, a phenomenon known as a transit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To detect something as small as the Earth, the measurements need to be done with a precision available only in space, away from the atmospheric turbulence that makes stars twinkle, and far from Earth so that our home world does not intrude on the view of shadow worlds in that patch of sky. It will take three or more years -- until the end of Barack Obama's current term in office -- before astronomers know whether Kepler has found any distant Earths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Kepler finds the planets, Dr. Borucki explained, life could be common in the universe. The results will point the way for future missions aimed at getting pictures of what Carl Sagan, the late Cornell astronomer and science popularizer, called ''pale blue dots'' out in the universe, and the search for life and perhaps intelligence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the results will be profound either way. If Kepler doesn't come through, that means Earth is really rare and we might be the only extant life in the universe and our loneliness is just beginning. ''It would mean there might not be 'Star Trek,' '' Dr. Borucki said during a recent news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The need, indeed even the possibility, of a planetary census is a recent development in cosmic history. It was only in 1995 that the first planet was detected orbiting another Sun-like star, by Michel Mayor and his colleagues at Geneva Observatory. In the years since then there has been a torrent of discoveries, 340 and counting, that has bewildered astronomers and captured the popular imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What exists is an incredibly random, chaotic, wild range of planets,'' said Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University, also a veteran planet hunter who is not a member of the Kepler team. So far none of them qualify as prime real estate for life, and few of them reside in systems that resemble our own solar system. Many of the first planets discovered were so-called hot Jupiters, gas giants zipping around their stars in a few days in tight, blisteringly hot orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the planets have been found by what is called the wobble method, in which the presence of a planet is deduced by observing the to-and-fro gravitational tug it gives its star as it orbits. The closer a planet is to its star, the bigger the tug and the easier it is to detect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smallest exoplanet discovered is about three times as massive as the Earth. It is known as MOA-2007-BLG-192-L b, but astronomers don't know yet whether its home star is real star or a failed star called a brown dwarf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer Dr. Mayor announced that his team had found three so-called warm super-Earths -- roughly four, seven and nine times the mass of the Earth -- orbiting within frying distance of a star known as HD 40307 in the constellation Pictor. Indeed, Dr. Mayor proclaimed that according to their data, about a third of all Sun-like stars host such super-Earths or super-Neptunes in tight orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all this is prelude. Astronomers agree that these planets are oddballs according to any reasonable theory of planet formation. But as Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington pointed out, they are easy to detect by the wobble method. The fact that they are there suggests that there are many more modest-size planets to be found in larger, more habitable orbits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler mission is a tribute to the perseverance of Dr. Borucki, who began proposing it to NASA in the 1980s, before any exoplanets had been discovered, and kept campaigning for it. ''He had the true faith,'' Dr. Boss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many technical hurdles had be overcome before Kepler became practical. In particular it required very accurate and sensitive digital detectors, said James Fanson, of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Kepler's project manager. As seen from outside the solar system, the Earth blocks only about 0.008 percent of the Sun's light when it passes in front, or ''transits.'' Kepler has been built to detect changes in brightness as small as 0.002 percent, equivalent to a flea crawling across a car headlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By measuring the diminution of a star's light during an exoplanet transit, astronomers in principle will be able to determine the size of the exoplanet. From the intervals between eclipses, astronomers will be able to determine its orbit.. By combining this with other data, from, say, wobble measurements, they will be able to zero in on important properties like mass and density.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, natural variations in the star's output, caused by something like starspots, could interfere with the data and obscure the signals from small planets. That is a problem, Dr. Fanson said, with the Corot satellite, which was launched by the European Space Agency at the end of 2006 and also carries a telescope and camera to look for small changes in starlight. To weed out the noisy stars, Kepler will keep track of 170,000 stars for the first year and then narrow its attention to a mere 100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corot, which stands for convection, rotation and planetary transits, is smaller than Kepler and is designed to investigate the structure of stars by detecting vibrations and tremors within them that cause them to periodically brighten and fade. Corot, which Dr. Borucki called ''a complementary mission,'' also looks at a given patch of stars for only a few months and so would miss the successive transits of an Earth-like planet, which, to be habitable, would have to take about a year to orbit a Sun-like star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all 100,000 stars in the field of Kepler's view would have their planetary systems oriented to provide eclipses from our particular point of view, of course. Dr. Borucki and his colleagues estimate that for an Earth-like star in its habitable zone, the stars would align to produce a blot out in half of 1 percent of cases, yielding a few dozen to a few hundred new Earths out there. For planets that are closer in, however, the odds rise to about 10 percent, so there are ample reasons to expect a bumper crop of new planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Borucki said the astronomers had set the goal of observing at least three such transits, to confirm the period and rule out interference from starspots, and then obtaining backup observations from other telescopes -- of wobble measurements, say -- before announcing they have found a planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we make a discovery we want it to be bulletproof,'' Dr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that the first planets to be discovered and announced will be the biggest planets with the shortest orbits, the so-called hot Jupiters. Four stars with such planets are in the search area and thus will be an early test of Kepler's acuity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the first six months, hot Jupiters are going to roll off the Kepler assembly line,'' Dr. Fischer said, adding, ''These are bizarre planets, we don't understand how they form.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hardest and most exciting part of the mission, detecting bona fide Earths, will also take the longest. Such a planet should take about a year to circle a Sun-like star, producing only one blip a year in its starlight. So it would take more than three years to produce the requisite three blips and subsequent confirmation by ground-based telescopes before the epochal discovery is announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Borucki said, ''We're not going to be able to tell you very quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they will eventually tell us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Boss, a high-ranking member of the Kepler science team, said: ''It really is going to count many Earths. About four years from now we will have a really good estimate of how many Earths there are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the history of exoplanet astronomy is any guide, there are likely to be surprises that geologists had not imagined -- water worlds, for example. And then, if all keeps going well, it will be time to confront the next series of questions: whether anywhere else in this galaxy the dust that once spewed from stars has come alive and conscious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my 25 years of working with NASA this is the most exciting mission I've worked on, said Dr. Fanson, who will step down as project manager after the launching. ''We are going to be able to answer for the first time a question that has been pondered since the time of the ancient Greeks. Are there other worlds like ours? The question has come down to us from 100 generations. We get to answer it. I find that tremendously exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a reporter departed from journalistic objectivity to venture a hope that other Earths are out there, Dr. Fanson happily joined in. ''I hope the answer is yes,'' he said. ''I hope the universe is teeming with planets like Earth.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why did the early United States astronauts land in the ocean while Russian spacemen returned to dryland?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In the infancy of the two space programs, there was a lot of technological trial and error, but the landing sites resulted in large part from geography.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was desirable to launch astronauts and cosmonauts in a west-to-east direction to take advantage of the extra boost from Earth's spin. If the launching was aborted, the capsule would come to rest east of the launching site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, this meant the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Canaveral. In the vast, empty interior of the old Soviet Union, a terrestrial landing site had to be planned for, though it was also possible for the craft to land in water. The steppes of Kazakhstan, where the secret Baikonur Cosmodrome was built, offered the added advantage of being far from prying eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after a successful flight, the space capsule would ideally land in or near its home territory, or at least somewhere neutral during the cold war. Again, this meant an ocean for Americans, inland for Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA online history makes it clear that ocean landings were not ideal: ''A splashdown utilizing a large, expensive naval fleet and the danger of losing a small spacecraft in the vast ocean was deemed a necessary evil for Mercury because of the relative ease of designing a capsule capable of providing a survivable water landing, and the wide margin for targeting error contained in those miles of empty ocean.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has set Wednesday at 9:20 p.m. Eastern time as the launching date for the space shuttle Discovery. Its mission to the International Space Station had been planned for mid-February, but was delayed because of concerns over a valve that broke during the shuttle Endeavour's mission in November. There were concerns that a piece of valve breaking off at a crucial point during liftoff could prove catastrophic. The valves are used to regulate the flow of hydrogen gas from the main engines to the external fuel tank. Using a new testing method, engineers were able to identify three valves that are free of cracks for the Discovery's flight. In addition, engineers performed calculations and experiments to be confident that even if a piece broke off, it would not cause significant damage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new spacecraft, built to hunt the heavens for other Earth-like planets, roared into space from the Kennedy Space Center on top of a Delta 2 rocket at 10:49 p.m. Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, Kepler, named after the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the planetary laws of motion, is to spend the next three and a half years in an orbit around the Sun, where it will count planets by looking for the tiny blips in starlight caused by planets eclipsing their suns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA scientists said they would spend the next two months checking out the spacecraft. During the $600 million mission, Kepler will stare at a patch of the Milky Way in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, recording the brightness of 100,000 different stars every half-hour. It is equipped with the largest digital camera ever flown in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to accomplish the first rigorous census of planets and determine how rare or common Earth-like planets really are. Astronomers associated with Kepler estimate that they could find dozens of such planets in so-called habitable zones suitable for life as we know it, but that it would take about four years to establish their presence. The answer should pave the way for future efforts to study and collect images of terrestrial planets and to search for signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are there other worlds or are we alone?'' asked William Borucki, of NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in California, the chief Kepler scientist. ''We could get that answer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Morse, director of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, said in a news conference a few weeks before the launch, ''Kepler will answer a profound and fundamental question about our place in the universe.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some things seem doomed to divide us: Lennon versus McCartney, Yankees versus Mets, boxers versus briefs and so on. If you love one, you'll probably loathe the other, and each camp makes an equally convincing case as to why its choice is right. For design nuts, one of those alpha-versus-beta divisions is choosing between the two logos of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, also known as NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One is the symbol that NASA adopted in 1959 and still uses today. It's the NASA Insignia, commonly known as ''the meatball'' for the obvious reason that it looks like one. The other is the logo that replaced it from 1975 to 1992. It, too, has an official name, the NASA Logotype, and a similarly self-explanatory nickname, ''the worm.'' The arguments in favor of both are steeped in space-race romanticism, but they also tell us why some organizational identities (to give logos their posh name) seem so special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the meatball, introduced the year after NASA was founded. The agency already had an official emblem in the Seal, on which its name was written in full around a picture of a spacecraft orbiting a cluster of planets. Like many logos at the time, it resembled an ancient heraldic crest, in the hope, presumably, of evoking something powerful and imposing. NASA decided that it needed another, less formal logo and asked James Modarelli of the NASA Lewis Research Center to design it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a cartoonish version of the Seal in a patriotic palette of red, white and blue. The spacecraft orbits the initials N, A, S and A in a starlit sky (it's those stars that resemble a meatball's dimples) and an elongated V in the shape of the latest hypersonic wings. The effect is slightly amateurish, but endearingly so because: (a) we're accustomed to sensing the human touch behind famous corporate logos, like those of <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> and Kellogg's, both of which were intended to look like their founders' handwriting; (b) there's a great amateur-design tradition at NASA, where the crew for each mission designs special patches for its spacesuits; and (c) the meatball was drawn with a verve that speaks volumes about Modarelli and his colleagues' passion for outer space. ''It's so quaint, so romantic and very fitting for the spacecraft of that time,'' said the graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the meatball shows us what made NASA so thrilling -- rockets, planets and sexy-sounding hypersonic stuff -- the worm simply suggests it, and does so with such skill that it's become the design purists' favorite. It was commissioned as part of the Federal Design Improvement Program, a 1972 initiative supported by President Nixon to modernize the use of design by government agencies. Danne &amp; Blackburn, a New York firm specializing in corporate identity, was charged with designing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worm consists of NASA's initials portrayed in super-simple letters stripped to absolute essentials. There aren't even any crossbars on the A's, which are depicted as upturned V's, rather like rockets ready for liftoff. Each letter is composed of a tube, with the first A flowing into the S, as if speeding off into space. The word mark (as graphic designers call it) is in a confident shade of red, occasionally with NASA's full name written below in black Helvetica, the default typeface for any 1970s corporation with aspirations to modernity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything about the worm is seductively new, optimistic and futuristic, declaring that NASA is leading us toward a brighter, bolder future. The message is so clear that it doesn't need to be explained by words or pictures (nor does the symbolism of other cleverly designed word marks like the <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> logo, with that arrow hidden cunningly between the E and the X). ''The worm is a great-looking word mark and looked fantastic on the spacecraft,'' recalled Michael Bierut, a partner in the New York design firm Pentagram. ''By any objective measure, the worm was and is absolutely appropriate, and the meatball was and is an amateurish mess.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the meatball was revived in 1992 as part of the efforts to revitalize NASA after its traumas of the 1980s. NASA decided to bring back the symbol of its golden age and has stuck with it ever since. The meatball still reminds us of the triumph of the Mercury and Apollo missions, even though NASA has never recaptured its former glory, as illustrated by its recent problems with the design of the Ares spacecraft system. ''The meatball and the worm are both brilliant in their own ways,'' said the space-obsessed industrial designer Marc Newson. ''Though they say so much more about how NASA was and should be than how it is right now.'' ALICE RAWSTHORN</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A former top NASA official has been indicted on charges of steering $9.6 million in agency money to a consulting client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States attorney's office announced a three-count indictment on Friday against the former official, Courtney Stadd of Bethesda, Md., who had served as NASA's chief of staff and White House liaison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indictment accuses Mr. Stadd of steering money from an earth science appropriation to Mississippi State University, which was paying him as a consultant. Mr. Stadd is also accused of lying to NASA ethics officials investigating the matter. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on all three charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stadd, who joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as chief of staff in 2001 and left the agency in 2003, served as President-elect George W. Bush's NASA transition chief in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stadd ''was centrally involved in the organization and management of NASA,'' said John Logsdon, a Smithsonian Institution space scholar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was in many ways the White House representative to the NASA front office,'' said Mr. Logsdon, a member of the NASA Advisory Council. ''So he had a fair degree of influence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the indictment, Mr. Stadd started a management consulting firm called Capital Solutions that specialized in advising aerospace-related clients, including the Georesources Institute at Mississippi State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute paid Mr. Stadd $85,000 in fees and travel costs to edit documents and prepare community outreach and public communications material, the indictment says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, a former NASA associate administrator and Mr. Stadd's former deputy, said that the indictment was ''bizarre'' and that it did not fit with the conscientious and ethical person he knew Mr. Stadd to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stadd returned to NASA as a consultant in 2005 to help with the transition to a new administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said Mr. Pace, now a professor at George Washington University.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The space shuttle Discovery is set to lift off Wednesday night on a two-week mission, carrying a replacement part for a water recycler and a final set of solar arrays for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Tuesday, Kathy Winters, NASA's shuttle weather officer, said a forecast of clear skies and light winds provided ''90 percent go weather'' for the launching, scheduled for 9:20 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's main cargo is a 45-foot-long, 31,000-pound truss segment, the last piece for the space station's backbone structure. Shuttle astronauts will install the truss on the first of four spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the solar panels are unfurled and plugged in, the station's power-generating capacity will rise to 120 kilowatts from 90 kilowatts. That will be enough to support a six-person station crew and double the amount of power available for experiments, to 30 kilowatts from 15 kilowatts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery is also carrying a 180-pound replacement part for a water recycling system that the shuttle Endeavour took to the space station in November. But a key part in the apparatus that transforms urine into drinkable water failed almost immediately. NASA would like the recycling system fully functional before the number of crew members increases to six from three, planned for late May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a priority to get it on orbit, installed and get the urine processing assembly back functioning,'' said Robert L. Ashley, payload manager for the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission's commander is Col. Lee J. Archambault of the Air Force. Also aboard will be Cmdr. Dominic A. Antonelli of the Navy as pilot, and the mission specialists Joseph M. Acaba, Steven R. Swanson, Richard R. Arnold II and John L. Phillips, and Koichi Wakata of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Dr. Wakata will remain aboard the station and replace Sandra H. Magnus, who has been there since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery was originally scheduled to lift off on Feb. 12, but was delayed several times over lingering concerns over valves that regulate the flow of hydrogen gas from the main engines in the orbiter to the external fuel tank. On the Endeavour flight in November, part of one the valves broke off. That did not affect the Endeavour, but there was concern that a larger piece breaking off could potentially be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a series of experiments and computer simulations, NASA engineers determined that even if a piece broke off again, it would not cause significant damage. In addition, a new magnetic testing procedure can now detect much smaller cracks than previously possible, and three crack-free valves have been installed on the Discovery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle Discovery will remain on the ground until at least Sunday to repair a hydrogen leak that scrubbed a Wednesday launching. That will shorten what was planned as a 14-day mission, because the Discovery has to undock from the space station before the arrival of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, scheduled to be launched March 26. If the Discovery is not launched by Tuesday, then the mission will probably be pushed to April, with repercussions to future shuttle missions and the construction of the space station. The hydrogen leak occurred near the connection of a vent line to the shuttle's external fuel tank. The vent line allows excess pressure to flow away from the tank and away from the spacecraft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-man crew of the International Space Station climbed into the Soyuz spacecraft lifeboat for 11 minutes Thursday afternoon as a small but potentially dangerous piece of an old rocket motor whizzed past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space debris was about five inches wide and although the odds of a collision were small, ''It's enough we were worried about the crew, and they were taking an abundance of caution,'' said Josh Byerly, a NASA spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar near-misses where the crew was at least prepared to enter the Soyuz have occurred five times since the station's construction began in 1998, Mr. Byerly said. Usually, the crew can nudge the space station's orbit out of the way of oncoming debris, but NASA received notice of the latest object late last night after the crew -- Michael Fincke, Yury Lonchkov and Sandra Magnus -- had already gone to sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the crew members were instructed to evacuate the station and climb into the attached Soyuz module at 12:34 p.m. Eastern time. The space debris passed by at 12:39 p.m., and the crew emerged six minutes later.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several photographs taken by NASA's Phoenix Mars spacecraft show what look like water droplets clinging to one of its landing struts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the scientists working on the mission are asserting that that is exactly what they were. They contend that there are pockets of liquid water just under the Martian surface even though the temperatures in the northern plains never warmed above minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit during the six months of Phoenix's operations last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists believe that salts may have lowered the freezing temperature of the Martian water droplets to perhaps minus 90 degrees, or more than 120 degrees colder than the usual freezing temperature of 32 degrees for pure water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nilton O. Renno, a professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences at the University of Michigan who proposed the hypothesis, was careful to say, ''This is not a proof.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added: ''I think the evidence is overwhelming. It's not circumstantial evidence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Renno will present his data and arguments this month in a talk at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, and he is the lead author among 22 authors of a scientific paper submitted to The Journal of Geophysical Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are completely unconvinced. ''There are simpler explanations,'' said Michael H. Hecht, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a co-investigator of the Phoenix's wet chemistry instrument. Dr. Hecht, who described himself as the ''designated curmudgeon,'' said he believed that the process proposed by Dr. Renno to describe the formation and movement of water droplets was ''flat-out wrong for these materials.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter H. Smith, the mission's principal investigator, is left to mediate the disagreement. He wonders whether the material, splashed up and possibly transformed by the heat and spray of chemicals from the thrusters when Phoenix landed, tells much or anything at all about the conditions on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the lack of consensus, the Phoenix science team never brought up the liquid droplet hypothesis during any of the NASA news conferences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core facts are not in dispute. There were blobs on the strut. The blobs changed and moved over time before disappearing later in the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists also agree that the fundamental physics of Dr. Renno's hypothesis is sound. And it dovetails with the major undisputed finding of the Phoenix mission: the unexpected discovery of chemicals known as perchlorates in the soil. Perchlorates are salts, and if they were dissolved in high enough concentrations in water, the resulting brine would be a liquid at Martian surface temperatures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Renno believes that Phoenix's thrusters splashed a pocket of brine from just below the surface to the landing strut. He said the salts would have absorbed water vapor from the air, explaining how they appeared to grow in size during the first 44 Martian days before slowly evaporating as the temperatures dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Hecht believes that the droplet shape was in part a trick of low-resolution images and lighting. His simpler explanation is that these were just small clumps of frost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central scientific disagreement is whether the landing strut was warmer or colder than the ground. Exposed ice seen below the lander was clearly disappearing over time, vanishing into water vapor. Dr. Renno maintains that because of the heating systems on the spacecraft, the landing struts were warmer than the ground, and it is thermodynamically impossible for simple water frost to move from the cold ground to the warmer leg. But perchlorate salt could act as a sponge to absorb water vapor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hecht said that the strut was in the shadow of the lander and that the ground was in sunshine, so the leg was colder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix Mars lander, as expected, froze to death in November with the oncoming winter. But Dr. Renno and collaborators in Spain have been conducting experiments to see if they can replicate the behavior on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The initial results,'' Dr. Renno said, ''are consistent with what we see as liquid water.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why haven't the icy particles and dust that make up the rings of Saturn coalesced into a moon?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.NASA scientists suggest that some of the moons of Saturn are giving rise to rings, rather than vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saturn has a complicated array of rings as well as more than 50 known icy moons, and more moons are being discovered. The latest is apparently a moonlet announced in 2007, found by the Cassini space probe in a bright area of Saturn's faint G ring, one of the outer rings. It was the only ring not previously known to be associated with a moon. Scientists say they believe it is an agglomeration of relatively large particles and a main source of the particles in the ring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not known for sure if the rings of Saturn date from very early in the history of the solar system or are comparatively recent, but NASA suggests that they formed at different times and in different processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Cassini found what NASA describes as ''a great plume of icy material blasting from the moon Enceladus,'' believed to be a major source of material for the E ring. Moreover, NASA says, ''most of the planet's small, inner moons appear to orbit within partial or complete rings formed from particles blasted off their surfaces by impacts of micrometeoroids.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini also found that Rhea, another of the moons of Saturn, apparently has its own rings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's online contest to name a new room at the International Space Station went awry. The comedian Stephen Colbert won. The name Colbert beat out NASA's four suggested options in the space agency's effort to have the public help name the addition. NASA's mistake was allowing write-ins. Mr. Colbert urged viewers of his Comedy Central show, ''The Colbert Report,'' to write in his name. And they complied, with 230,539 votes. That beat Serenity, one of the NASA choices, by more than 40,000 votes. Nearly 1.2 million votes were cast by the time the contest ended Friday. NASA reserves the right to choose an appropriate name, and an agency spokesman said NASA would decide in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists who for the first time tracked an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, and watched as it exploded in the atmosphere, have now picked up some of the remnants on the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery and analysis of the meteorites, reported in Thursday's issue of Nature, give scientists solid data on the composition of meteorites that originate from at least one type of asteroid, known as F-class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of asteroids, mostly small, whirl around the solar system, and over the years people have picked up tens of thousands of meteorites, the surviving rock fragments of asteroids that collide with Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But we don't know where a single one of them comes from,'' said Michael E. Zolensky, a cosmic mineralogist at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, during a NASA-sponsored news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed when Petrus M. Jenniskens, a scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., organized a search team to comb through a Sudan desert to look for pieces of an asteroid that had been spotted less than a day before it hit Earth last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the first time, we can dot the line between the meteorite in our hands and the asteroid astronomers saw in space,'' said Dr. Jenniskens, the lead author of the Nature paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 280 pieces, about 10 pounds in total, are of a rare type of meteorite known as ureilites. The hodgepodge of minerals in ureilites indicates they were heated up but not fully melted, suggesting that they were once part of a much larger asteroid that possessed planetlike geological processes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because ureilites are now linked to F-class asteroids, also rare, the hope is that scientists can now determine the history of asteroids, which contain some of the most primitive materials left over from the early solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like the first step towards a Rosetta stone of understanding asteroids,'' Dr. Zolensky said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cascade of discovery started when Richard Kowalski, working with the of the University of Arizona, spotted a moving white dot on his computer screen late Oct. 5 at an observatory on Mount Lemmon outside Tucson. He sent the coordinates to the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A computer program at the center automatically calculates the orbits of reported projects, but it failed for the object Mr. Kowalski reported, because Earth's gravity appeared to be greatly distorting its orbit. The next morning, when Timothy B. Spahr, the center's director, took a closer look, the asteroid, designated 2008 TC3, looked as if it was being pulled directly into Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Spahr notified Steven R. Chesley, a scientist in NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ''For the first time ever, I saw an impact probability of 100 percent pop up on the computer screen,'' Dr. Chesley said. ''And this was, needless to say, the kind of thing that makes you sit up straight in the chair.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the asteroid was dim, the astronomers knew that it was small, about the size of a car and 80 tons, and would not cause any significant damage. Notice quickly spread, and asteroid watchers, professional and amateur, pointed their telescopes toward it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With hundreds of observations coming in during the day, the computers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory refined the trajectory. ''Our last pre-impact prediction was accurate to about a kilometer and a couple tenths of a second in the impact time,'' Dr. Chesley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid disintegrated about 23 miles over the Nubian desert of northern Sudan about an hour before sunrise, 20 hours after Mr. Kowalski discovered it. It released the energy of one to two kilotons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We figured that probably was the end of the story,'' Dr. Chesley said. The expectation was that none of 2008 TC3 survived the passage through the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But still, Dr. Jenniskens, an expert on meteor showers, wondered. ''If we could find something, it would be tremendous,'' he said. ''So you have to try. It was really a long shot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, he flew to Sudan and organized a team of 45 students and staff members from the University of Khartoum to search through the desert for fragments of 2008 TC3. And they found the shiny black fragments that had come from space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- With the shuttle Discovery safely away from the International Space Station, a Russian Soyuz rocket blasted off Thursday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying two fresh crew members and a wealthy space tourist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under an overcast sky, the Soyuz TMA-14 spacecraft roared to life with a burst of flame and smoke at 7:49 a.m. Eastern time and smoothly climbed away from the same launch pad used by Yuri Gagarin at the dawn of the space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On board were the Expedition 19 commander, Gennady Padalka, a Russian air force colonel; a United States flight engineer, Dr. Michael Barratt, a physician-astronaut; and Charles Simonyi, a Hungarian-born software developer making his second paid visit to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Television views from inside the cramped capsule showed all three men looking calm and relaxed as their rocket accelerated toward space, Colonel Padalka in the center seat and Dr. Barratt to his left monitoring cockpit displays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine minutes after liftoff, the Soyuz slipped into orbit. Over the next two days, Colonel Padalka will guide the spacecraft toward a docking at the space station's aft port around 9:14 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd like to pass on our congratulations,'' the station commander, Mike Fincke, radioed. ''We're looking forward to welcoming them aboard in just a few days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle Discovery's seven-member crew, orbiting slightly ahead of the space station, spent the day carrying out a final heat shield inspection before packing up Friday for the trip back to Earth. Touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center is expected around 1:38 p.m. Saturday, about four and a half hours after the Soyuz docking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's launching was a major milestone for NASA and the Russian space agency, the first of two Soyuz flights intended to increase the station's crew size to six full-time astronauts from three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to delivery of a fourth and final set of solar arrays by Discovery's crew, along with a replacement centrifuge for the lab's repaired water recycling system, the sprawling eight-module outpost finally has the power and resources necessary to support a full-size crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russians plan to launch another Soyuz on May 27 carrying the cosmonaut Roman Romanenko, the European Space Agency astronaut Frank De Winne of Belgium and the Canadian Space Agency astronaut Robert Thirsk. ''The station is very large and complex, and it was designed to produce a lot of science,'' said Dr. Barratt, a former NASA flight surgeon. ''We need six people to adequately man the station to get the science out of it we want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with conducting research in Earth orbit, Dr. Barratt said lessons learned living and working aboard the complex would help pave the way for future expeditions to the moon and Mars. ''It'll probably be crews of six or so, living together for long periods of time,'' he said. ''We hope to prove a lot of those concepts on station, starting now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sixth member of the Expedition 20 crew is the Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, who joined Discovery's crew for the ride to orbit. He replaced the departing flight engineer Sandra Magnus, who is returning to Earth aboard the shuttle after four months in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colonel Padalka and Dr. Barratt are replacing the Expedition 18 commander, Colonel Fincke, and the cosmonaut Yuri Lonchakov, who were launched to the station last October. After a 10-day handover period, Colonel Fincke, Colonel Lonchakov and Mr. Simonyi will return to Earth, landing in Kazakhstan on April 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone interview from Baikonur, Mr. Simonyi said he planned to help Russian engineers calibrate space radiation sensors, chat with schoolchildren via ham radio and discuss his experiences with Internet readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would not discuss how much he actually paid for his space flights, saying only that the list price for a Soyuz seat was $35 million. ''The price is going up,'' he said. ''Future seats that NASA has bought are even more expensive. This has to be put into perspective, because other means of getting to space are even more expensive, so this one is actually quite cost effective at the current state of technology.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- On Tuesday, six people will be voluntarily locked into a cloister of cramped, hermetically sealed tubes woven inside a Moscow research facility the size of a high school gymnasium. They will eat dehydrated food, breathe recycled air and be denied conversation with practically everyone else but one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they must stay inside for 105 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a small step in the direction of Mars, the international crew is embarking on a simulated flight to the planet to test the limits of human tolerance for the isolation and monotony of interplanetary travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is really like a real space flight without the weightlessness and the danger to our lives,'' said Sergei N. Ryazansky, a cosmonaut-in-training who will lead the mission. ''On the inside, we will have a lack of incoming information, so it's the science of sensory deprivation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Mars-500, the Russian-led project based at the Institute for Biomedical Problems here will culminate in a 520-day simulation beginning early next year of a complete manned mission to the planet -- a time frame that incorporates launching to Mars touchdown and back -- that scientists hope will edge humanity a little closer to that next giant leap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An actual manned mission to Mars may be more than 20 years away, but Russian scientists, backed by the nation's leaders, are keen to take a lead role in laying the foundation. The Mars-500 project is moving forward despite the dire economic situation in Russia; the prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, has pledged not to cut financing to the space industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's research into manned space flights has taken on added importance as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States prepares to shut down the space shuttle program, leaving Russia with a monopoly on manned launchings until NASA's new Ares rockets take flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for scientists and cosmonauts involved in the project, the cosmic competition that defined the cold war and the race to the Moon has given way to a new spirit of international cooperation. In addition to Russian space agencies, the Mars-500 project involves scientists from organizations like the European Space Agency and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute based in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are proud that we have an experiment that has received wide international coverage and that has attracted the top scientists of other countries,'' said Mark S. Belakovsky, the project's deputy director. ''We are working not only for ourselves but for the future of humanity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Belakovsky and others working on the project say only an international effort will be able to overcome the daunting obstacles to any future manned mission to Mars. Crews must be protected from hazardous radiation and muscle and bone atrophy caused by long-term weightlessness, not to mention the myriad potential pitfalls that will follow that first step onto Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Protecting crews from themselves, however, poses special challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interplanetary travel will markedly differ from long-term missions in orbit around Earth, where crews remain in contact with mission control, receiving assistance from specialists on the ground and well wishes from family and friends. On a mission to Mars, astronauts will have to contend with communication gaps of as long as 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Working in such conditions requires that a person be able to check himself, evaluate his condition in relation to the crew and in relation to mission control and be able to correct himself,'' said Boris V. Marukov, the experiment's director and a former crew member on the International Space Station. ''He will be a psychotherapist for himself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the risks and expense, many scientists think the potential scientific gains from a manned Mars voyage will outweigh the advantages of interplanetary exploration by robots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless there is a huge breakthrough in artificial intelligence, having the human being on site, being able to make scientific decisions on the fly, in real time -- there is really little substitute for that,'' said Jim Logan, a former chief of medical operations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longest a human has spent in space is 438 days, a record set by Valery V. Polyakov when he returned from the Russian space station, Mir, in 1995. His safe and healthy return, he said in an interview, showed that ''it is possible to preserve your physical and psychological health throughout a mission similar in length to a flight to Mars and back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volunteers for the first leg of Mars-500 -- four Russians, a German and a Frenchman -- will oversee and participate in more than 70 experiments testing fluctuations in metabolism, sleep-wake cycles and the cardiovascular and immune systems under conditions of prolonged isolation. Another experiment will study cross-cultural compatibility in the expectation that any real Mars mission will involve an international crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mock spacecraft consists of four hermetically sealed modules built in the 1970s for isolation experiments ahead of missions aboard Soviet space stations and later the International Space Station. A section was recently added in which participants in the 520-day experiment will simulate a Mars landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The facility's wood-paneled interior maintains a particularly Soviet aesthetic, but it has been equipped with new life-support systems to be tested during the Mars-500 project. Volunteers will tend experimental greenhouses that scientists hope will provide fresh vegetables and sights and smells of home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists in a control center at the Institute of Biomedical Problems will monitor the activities of the crew via video cameras mounted in most sections of the facility, watching for stress and tension among crewmembers. They will largely keep out of the crew's affairs and will impose the 20-minute communication delay anticipated on a real Mars mission during the final 35 days of the experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a stream of mock emergency situations and inevitable disagreements between crewmates, the volunteers will endeavor to keep emotional control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Past experiments in long-term isolation have shown how intergroup conflicts can endanger a mission. During a nine-month simulated Earth-orbit mission starting in 1999 and conducted at the same Moscow institute, a male Russian's attempt to kiss a female Canadian colleague ended in accusations of sexual harassment and the Russians' being barred from the woman's module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ryazansky, who took part in that experiment, is optimistic that advancements in space psychology have made these kinds of conflicts less likely. And while he does not think he will actually ever fly to Mars, he believes his work on Mars-500 will allow him at least to see a manned mission in his lifetime.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in Washington are moving to revitalize yet another faltering American industry: the business of making the communications satellites that hover above Earth and knit the planet into a global community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this rescue would not cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. In fact it could be virtually free -- if Congressional Democrats succeed in lifting export controls that classify satellite technology as weapons and have handicapped American manufacturers since the last days of the Clinton administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House hearings on the controls are to begin Thursday. Proponents of change are optimistic, pointing to a campaign pledge by President Obama and the support of respected figures like Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George Bush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the export revision is by no means a sure thing. The national security arguments cited in imposing the limits still resonate with conservatives who believe strict regulation is needed to keep China and other countries from stealing secret technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the rules took effect in 1999, the legal complications involved in selling commercial communications satellites and components abroad have contributed to a sharp decline in American companies' share of the market, from nearly 90 percent to about 50 percent. The drop in sales has coincided with a reversal in America's balance of trade in high technology, which went negative in 2002 and has stayed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama issued a policy statement that faulted the rules as having ''unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry'' and cost the nation billions of dollars. As president, he said, he would push for change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the administration is tapping a leading proponent of export revisions, Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a California Democrat who is chairwoman of the centrist, 67-member New Democrat Coalition. Ms. Tauscher recently announced that she would give up her House seat to become under secretary of state for arms control and international security -- a key post overseeing the export bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before her nomination, Ms. Tauscher said the issue was one of her top priorities. ''It's an enormously big deal,'' she said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some lawmakers still have jitters about putting satellites into the hands of Washington's adversaries, and in particular those of Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the political environment we operate in, China is the third rail,'' Thomas C. Moore, a satellite export specialist for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a Washington conference in November. ''We have members who know China tests weapons in space, and they don't want to be accused of giving them any assistance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates of easing the export rules say they have damaged rather than enhanced national security and hobbled a field that was once a proud symbol of American innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first communications satellite to soar into stationary orbit was invented by Harold A. Rosen, then an engineer at Hughes Space and Communications. It flew in 1964.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once as small as wash tubs, the satellites now can rival a truck in size, weigh tons and cost $200 million. In space, their solar panels can unfurl to half the length of a football field. Each year, 10 to 30 are sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a height of 22,300 miles, the spacecraft beam signals over vast distances, relaying trillions of phone calls and linking ships to shore and soldiers to families. They send electronic school lessons to rural Africa, the Olympic Games live around the globe and convey TV shows to broadcasters, cable operators and homes equipped with dish antennas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spacecraft have been honored as quiet forces promoting development and democratic values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks satellites, said the United States had built 428 of the craft launched successfully into orbit -- the vast majority. It sold one-third to other nations, which typically used the satellites as stepping stones to development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1984, a European rocket lofted one of the American craft, starting a trend to launcher globalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strict export controls arose from a political fight over how far to open the field to China, which in the 1980s began offering cheap rides into orbit on low-cost rockets. A main issue was whether Beijing could be trusted, like a letter carrier, to make deliveries without peeking inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Ronald Reagan approved three satellite transfers to China. The first President Bush permitted nine more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Bill Clinton sought to regularize such exports. In early 1996, he directed that the licensing shift from the State Department to the Commerce Department, signaling the importance of economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in early 1998, a series of upsets brought the expanding trade to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two American satellite makers -- Hughes and Loral -- were accused of illegally giving China advice about making not only commercial rockets, but also military missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a federal grand jury investigated, the Republicans, who controlled Congress, held hearings. They warned that satellite exports threatened a hemorrhage of secret materials and information, and said that China might have already stolen encryption secrets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's critical that safeguards are in place,'' Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said at a hearing in September 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month later, the Republicans attached to a defense bill a rider that sought to license commercial satellites as weapons and give Congress authority to supervise the exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clinton, weakened by calls for his impeachment, signed the bill into law. But he called the move unnecessary, saying it threatened to ''hamper the U.S. satellite industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Democrats and aerospace experts agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were out to get Clinton,'' said James A. Lewis, a former Commerce Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It really didn't have anything to do with export controls or national security.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new regulations quickly hurt American satellite makers. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> lost a $450 million order. Canadian firms pulled out of at least four projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2000, William A. Reinsch, then an under secretary of commerce, told the Senate that, from 1998 to 1999, satellite export sales had fallen by 40 percent. The drop, Mr. Reinsch said, harms ''the high-tech industries upon which our military and intelligence agencies depend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline accelerated as other countries, driven by pride and the allure of profits, joined the business. Around 2002, <span class="companylink">Alcatel</span> Space, based in France, started building communication satellites free of American parts and thus free of American export restrictions. It soon landed a $145 million order from China. Other satellite makers joined the de-Americanizing trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''anachronistic restrictions,'' Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, told his nation's space scientists, have ''spurred you to greater heights.'' India now has many communications satellites in orbit, and a science probe circling the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003 -- as American satellite exports fell to $215 million from $1.05 billion in 1998 -- the Commerce Department reported that the nation's annual balance of trade in high technology goods had declined for the first time. Hughes, the satellite pioneer (now a unit of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>), had 11 commercial satellite orders in 1998 and none in 2007, according to Futron, an aerospace consulting firm in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The United States invented this industry,'' said Peggy Slye, director for space and telecommunications at Futron. ''To see that lead eroded because of regulatory policy is very regrettable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The losses are even potentially risky. Congressional investigators examined the military's growing reliance on foreign communication satellites and warned that technical and political upheaval ''could affect the availability.'' Some commercial satellites had already suffered intentional disruption, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, called relaxation of the export policies a matter of urgency. The rules, it said in a report, weaken national security and discourage innovation, isolating domestic industries in ''a self-destructive strategy of obsolescence and declining economic competitiveness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scowcroft, the former national security adviser who is the report's co-chairman, said the government should reverse itself and assume that technology and information are harmless unless proven otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of saying, 'Is it all right to let this bit of information out?' we should say, 'Is there any compelling reason why we should not?' '' he said in an interview. ''Our default position ought to be openness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts still urge extreme caution. Baker Spring, a national security analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, advocates a country-by-country approach in which close allies could buy or launch satellites but not nations like China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hearing on Thursday, before the House Foreign Affairs trade subcommittee, features supporters and critics. But its chairman, Representative Brad J. Sherman, a California Democrat, told a satellite conference in Washington last week that the hope of new jobs could spur regulatory change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosen, the technology's inventor, who at 83 still consults for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, said he believed that the policy would shift and that the industry would rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm an optimist,'' he said. ''The reason I keep consulting is that I enjoy interacting with the young engineers, and they're as good as ever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 4, 2009, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Thursday with an article about export controls on satellite technology referred incorrectly to the launching of the Galaxy IIIC communication satellite, built by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. It was launched in 2002; it is not ''scheduled for a late-May launch.''</p>
