<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor that exploded over Russia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/russiaandtheformersovietunion/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] on Friday set off the largest explosion of its kind in more than a century, at least according to Western scientists. And even more unusual for a meteor, it caused numerous injuries, mostly from flying glass, as the shock wave violently jolted the city of Chelyabinsk below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hit on the same day that astronomers were watching another larger rock miss Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] by just 17,200 miles, and experts scrambled to understand the two rare cosmic events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some initially speculated that Earth was passing through a swarm of asteroids, but the Russian meteor came from the other direction. “There is no relation there,” said Paul Chodas, a scientist with NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org]’s Near Earth Object Program[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/]. “It seems like we’re in a cosmic shooting gallery here. There were two very rare events happening on the same day. Pure coincidence.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on preliminary calculations, the solar system interloper that shook Chelyabinsk weighed about 7,000 tons and was about 50 feet in diameter when it entered the atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour at about 9:20 a.m. local time, said Peter G. Brown, a professor of physics at the University of Western Ontario. Dr. Brown based his calculations on low-frequency sound waves that traveled as far as Alaska. A worldwide network of such sensors listens for these vibrations, too low to be heard by humans, to verify the ban on nuclear tests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russian experts estimated a much smaller size, of just 10 feet across and 10 tons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid streaked across the sky for about half a minute, unleashing thunderous sonic booms. (Asteroids are orbiting rocks usually between Mars and Jupiter; they are called meteors when they enter the Earth’s atmosphere and begin burning up.) The meteor was likely made of stony materials and not solid metal, so as pressure from the atmosphere increased, it exploded at an altitude of 12 to 15 miles above the surface. It released the equivalent energy of 300,000 tons of TNT, Dr. Brown said, although he said that estimate could be revised higher, perhaps to 500,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima during World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] was the equivalent of 15,000 tons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the largest recorded event since the 1908 Tunguska event[http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/30jun_tunguska/],” Dr. Chodas said. On June 30, 1908, the explosion of a meteor, believed to be an asteroid, flattened millions of trees over 800 square miles in a remote, largely unhabited area of central Siberia about 1,200 miles away from Friday’s event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a NASA news conference Friday afternoon, Bill&nbsp;Cooke, &nbsp;who leads the Meteoroid Environment Office[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/meo/home/index.html] at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the orbital path of the meteor showed that it was an asteroid, not a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At its farthest point from the Sun, it was 2.5 times as far away as the Earth, before its elliptical path took it closer, and the Earth got in its way on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other large meteors could have splashed unnoticed in an ocean in decades past, but nowadays military satellites on the watch for missile launches would certainly notice an incoming meteor this bright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asteroid was impossible to detect, Dr. Cooke said, because it was approaching from the dayside. “And as you know, telescopes can’t see things during the daytime,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark R. Chapman, a senior scientist at the Southwest Research Institute’s Department of Space Studies[http://www.swri.org/boulder10.htm] based in Boulder, Colo., said this was the first time a crashing meteor is known to have injured a large number of people. “That’s basically never happened before,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the emptiness of space, billions of rocks, from dust to those miles across, zip around the inner solar system, and collisions with the Earth’s atmosphere are frequent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most are mere grains, burning up high in the atmosphere. Larger ones — the size of peas — can be spotted streaking across the night sky as “shooting stars,” but those also never reach the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Small objects the size of a basketball hit the Earth almost every day, once a day on average, and car-size objects hit every month or two,” Dr. Chodas said. “Little stuff hits the Earth all the time. We just don’t know about it. It’s all burning up in the atmosphere.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists estimate that these tiny meteoritic bits add up to 80 tons of material falling on Earth from outer space each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giant impacts have changed the course of life on Earth, notably 65 million years ago when an object several miles wide slammed off the coast of Mexico and killed off the dinosaurs. Collisions with objects the size of the Russian meteor or 2012DA14, the asteroid that did not hit Earth on Friday, occur perhaps once a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA surveys had cataloged 95 percent of near-Earth asteroids 0.6 miles wide or wider, but fewer of the smaller ones. A year ago, a telescope in Spain discovered 2012 DA14, a 150-foot-wide asteroid just after it made a somewhat close pass to Earth, missing by 1.6 million miles. With an orbital period of 366 days, it made a return visit on Friday, at a much closer distance of 17,200 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is closer than many telecommunications satellites. But despite needless anxiety that it would hit Earth, its passing was uneventful, and it will not come that close again until at least 2080.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If 2012 DA14 had collided with Earth, it would have released the energy of 2.5 million tons of TNT, NASA scientists estimate, or nearly 10 times as much energy as the meteor in Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some estimates put the Tunguska event even bigger, perhaps 20 million tons of TNT. The makeup of an asteroid can vastly change the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Tunguska, the asteroid also exploded in the air. But in Arizona, an asteroid of similar energy, but made of nickel and iron, slammed into the ground about 50,000 years ago, leaving a crater[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/images/meteorcrater.html] 4,000 feet wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, astronomers do find the very small asteroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers also had fortuitous luck in 2008 when they discovered an asteroid, smaller than the Russian one, and were able to track it as it entered the atmosphere over Sudan 20 hours later. But most of the time, near misses of objects that small are missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is detectable, but only if we are looking at the right place at precisely the right time,” Dr. Chodas said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, scientists have been on the lookout for killer objects from outer space that could devastate the planet. But warnings that they lacked the tools to detect the most serious threats were largely ignored, even as skeptics mocked the worriers as Chicken Littles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more. The meteor that rattled Siberia on Friday, injuring hundreds of people and traumatizing thousands, has suddenly brought new life to efforts to deploy adequate detection tools, in particular a space telescope that would scan the solar system for dangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who helped build thriving companies like <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has already put millions of dollars into the effort and saw Friday's shock wave as a turning point in raising hundreds of millions more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wouldn't it be silly if we got wiped out because we weren't looking?'' said Edward Lu, a former NASA astronaut and <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who leads the detection effort. ''This is a wake-up call from space. We've got to pay attention to what's out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers know of no asteroids or comets that pose a major threat to the planet. But NASA estimates that fewer than 10 percent of the big dangers have been discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu's group, called the B612 Foundation after the imaginary asteroid on which the Little Prince lived, is one team of several pursuing ways to ward off extraterrestrial threats. NASA is another, and other private groups are emerging, like Planetary Resources, which wants not only to identify asteroids near Earth but also to mine them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our job is to be the first line of defense, and we take that very seriously,'' James Green, the director of planetary science at NASA headquarters, said in an interview Friday after the Russian strike. ''No one living on this planet has ever before been hurt. That's historic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green added that the Russian episode was sure to energize the field and that an even analysis of the meteor's remains could help reveal clues about future threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our scientists are excited,'' he said. ''Russian planetary scientists are already collecting meteorites from this event.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow awakening to the danger began long ago, as scientists found hundreds of rocky scars indicating that cosmic intruders had periodically reshaped the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discoveries included not just obvious features like Meteor Crater in Arizona, but wide zones of upheaval. A crater more than a hundred miles wide beneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico suggested that, 65 million years ago, a speeding rock from outer space had raised enough planetary mayhem to end the reign of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people remain skeptical of the cosmic threat and are glad for taxpayer money to go toward urgent problems on Earth rather than outer space. But many scientists who have examined the issues have become convinced that better precautions are warranted in much the same way that homeowners buy insurance for unlikely events that can result in severe damage to life and property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, astronomers turned their telescopes on the sky with increasing vigor to look for killer rocks. The rationale was statistical. They knew about a number of near misses and calculated that many other rocky threats whirling about the solar system had gone undetected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, with little fanfare, the Air Force also began scanning the skies for speeding rocks, giving credibility to an activity once seen as reserved for doomsday enthusiasts. It was the world's first known government search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> took a lead role with what it called the Spaceguard Survey. In 2007, it issued a report estimating that 20,000 asteroids and comets orbited close enough to the planet to deliver blows that could destroy cities or even end all life. Today, with limited financing, NASA supports modest telescopes in the southwestern United States and in Hawaii that make more than 95 percent of the discoveries of the objects coming near the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists lobbied hard for a space telescope that would get high above the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere. It would orbit the Sun, peering across the solar system, and would have a much better chance of finding large space rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the nation immersed in two wars and other earthly priorities, the government financing never materialized. Last year, Dr. Lu, who left the NASA astronaut corps in 2007 to work for <span class="companylink">Google</span>, joined with veterans of the space program and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B612 Foundation refers to its planned telescope as the world's first private mission to deep space. Private groups, it says on its Web site, can carry out ''audacious projects that previously only governments could accomplish -- and at lower cost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to launch a large telescope known as Sentinel that can find 90 percent of the asteroids larger than 460 feet in diameter that pass through the Earth's part of the solar system. They also want to discover smaller asteroids down to a diameter of 100 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such asteroids are much bigger than the meteor that hit the atmosphere over Russia, and the telescope would thus be blind to those kinds of smaller threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, the B612 Foundation, based in Mountain View, Calif., signed a contract with <span class="companylink">Ball Aerospace</span> to create prototype sensors for the Sentinel mission. The space telescope is to have a diameter of 20 inches. In theory, the system could be ready for launching by 2017 or 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Dr. Lu said the overall cost of the mission was now estimated at $450 million, including launching, insurance and operations. The group, far from that goal, has been soliciting money from citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's close approach to Earth of an asteroid named 2012 DA14, as well as the much smaller object whose shock wave broke windows and bones in Russia, prompted thousands of hits to the foundation's Web site and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account, said Diane Murphy, a spokeswoman for the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody is calling,'' she said. ''They see us as the solution. They're saying, 'When are you going to have the telescope up?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B612 is just one player. Last April, Planetary Resources unveiled plans to mine asteroids that zip close by Earth, both to provide supplies for future interplanetary travelers and to bring back metals like platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture attracted some big-name investors, including Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of <span class="companylink">Google</span>. The company also has plans to develop telescopes that would hunt for rocky intruders coming near the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green of NASA said the agency was preparing to launch a mission in 2016 that will fly to an asteroid and, in 2023, return a sample to Earth for detailed analyses. The insights are expected to help scientists learn more about the makeup of the threats whizzing through the cosmic shooting gallery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to protect the planet, you have to know your enemy,'' he said. ''You have to get up close and personal.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHEBARKUL, Russia -- After a brilliant flash illuminated the sky on Friday morning like a second sun, Alyona V. Borchininova and several others in this run-down little town in the Siberian wilderness wandered outside, confused and curious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They followed the light's path to the town's lakefront, where they trudged for about a mile over the open ice until they came to a startling sight: a perfectly round hole, about 20 feet in diameter, its rim glossy with fresh ice that had crusted on top of the snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was eerie,'' Ms. Borchininova, a barmaid, said Saturday. ''So we stood there. And then somebody joked, 'Now the green men will crawl out and say hello.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russians are still coming to terms with what NASA scientists say was a 7,000-ton chunk of space rock that hurtled out of the sky at 40,000 miles an hour, exploding over the Ural Mountains, spraying debris for miles around and, amazingly, killing no one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Russian government pursued the scientific mysteries of the exploding meteor, sending divers through the hole and into the inky waters of Lake Chebarkul on Saturday, residents reacted with a kind of giddy relief and humor over their luck at having survived a cosmic near miss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA estimates that when the meteor entered the atmosphere over Alaska, it weighed 7,000 to 10,000 tons and was at least 50 feet in diameter, a size that strikes the Earth about once every hundred years, and that it exploded with the force of 500 kilotons of TNT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shock wave injured hundreds of people about 54 miles away in the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, most from broken glass; collapsed a wall in a zinc factory; set off car alarms; and sent dishes flying in thousands of apartments. Broken windows exposed people and pipes to the Siberian winter; many residents focused Saturday on boarding windows and draining pipes to preserve heating systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If pieces of meteorite reached the surface, as NASA said was likely, they fell largely into the sea of birch and pine trees in this patch of western Siberia, now blanketed in snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Chebarkul is one of four sites that the government believes felt a significant impact, the minister of emergency situations, Vladimir Puchkov, told the Interfax news agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the sun rose there on Saturday, the snow crystals sparkling like a million tiny mirrors, steam wafted from the ice crater, apparently related to the work of the divers, but the lake yielded few clues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puchkov later said the divers had found nothing on the lake bed, but had not ruled out meteor shrapnel as the cause of the hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Experts are studying all possible places of impact,'' he said. ''We have no reports of confirmed discoveries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A meteorite fragment could help scientists better apprehend the composition of the meteor, perhaps shedding light on how close it was to descending further before exploding from the heat or to hitting the surface. Such circumstances could have caused vastly more casualties in this rust-belt region of military and industrial towns, a major nuclear research site and waste repository, and other delicate infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chelyabinsk, the worst-hit town, most who sought medical attention had been released from hospitals by Saturday, the Ministry of Health reported. A total of 1,158 people, including 298 children, sought medical care. Of those, 52 were hospitalized. On Saturday afternoon, 12 adults and 3 children remained in hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials evacuated to Moscow a woman who had broken two vertebrae after falling down stairs. One man's finger was cut off by broken glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overshadowing these misfortunes, a fourth-grade teacher in Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, was being hailed as a hero for saving 44 children from glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks when she saw the flash. Having no idea what it was, she executed a duck-and-cover drill from the cold war era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Karbysheva, who remained standing, was seriously lacerated when glass severed a tendon in one of her arms, Interfax reported; not one of her students suffered a cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 32-second terminal plunge into Siberia, the meteor left a smoke contrail in the sky that twirled in a diabolical, turbulent wake. Some witnesses described an unbearably bright light, and the feeling of heat on their exposed faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tatyana N. Vasiliyeva, a retired accountant who was walking with her husband on the lakeshore here Friday morning, said she had looked up to see ''a star getting brighter, like the sun.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a fiery star falling right on me,'' she said. ''And so I thought I should just close my eyes now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Saturday, she was back at the shore, giggly and disappointed that the police would not let her near the ice hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Russians found different meanings in the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hawkish deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin, suggested that the world's leading scientists develop a missile system to deflect asteroids from Earth. ''Today neither the United States nor Russia has the capability to shoot down such an object,'' he warned, according to Interfax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Church of the Transfiguration in Chebarkul, on a hill overlooking the lake, Deacon Sergiy was in mid-service on Friday, having just closed the doors in a wall of icons symbolizing the entombment of Jesus in the holy sepulcher and the imminence of the Resurrection. Just then, a bright light spilled in through every window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like a new sun was born,'' he said. ''This all gives us reason to think. Is the purpose of our life just to raise a family and die, or is it to live eternally? It was a reason for people on earth to look up, to look up at God.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the flash more significant than earlier signs he had noticed, like the time a white dove alighted on the church belfry, or when a cloud appeared above the church in the form of a cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the lake, an ice fisherman, who gave his name only as Dmitri, shrugged off the event. ''A meteor fell,'' he said. ''So what? Who knows what can fall out of the sky? It didn't hit anybody. That is the important thing,''</p>
<p>The police and reporters examined a 20-foot hole in the ice of Chebarkul Lake, one of several sites in Siberia where fragments from a meteor were believed to have struck the earth on Friday. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BEN SOLOMON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)   MAPS   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chelyabinsk, the worst-hit town, most who sought medical attention had been released from hospitals by Saturday, the Ministry of Health reported. A total of 1,158 people, including 298 children, sought medical care. Of those, 52 were hospitalized. On Saturday afternoon, 12 adults and 3 children remained in hospitals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health officials evacuated to Moscow a woman who had broken two vertebrae after falling down stairs. One man’s finger was cut off by broken glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overshadowing these misfortunes, a fourth-grade teacher in Chelyabinsk, Yulia Karbysheva, was being hailed as a hero for saving 44 children from glass cuts by ordering them to hide under their desks when she saw the flash. Having no idea what it was, she executed a duck-and-cover drill from the cold war era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Karbysheva, who remained standing, was seriously lacerated when glass severed a tendon in one of her arms, Interfax reported; not one of her students suffered a cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its 32-second terminal plunge into Siberia, the meteor left a smoke contrail in the sky that twirled in a diabolical, turbulent wake. Some witnesses described an unbearably bright light, and the feeling of heat on their exposed faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tatyana N. Vasiliyeva, a retired accountant who was walking with her husband on the lakeshore here Friday morning, said she had looked up to see “a star getting brighter, like the sun.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a fiery star falling right on me,” she said. “And so I thought I should just close my eyes now.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Saturday, she was back at the shore, giggly and disappointed that the police would not let her near the ice hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Russians found different meanings in the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hawkish deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin, suggested that the world’s leading scientists develop a missile system to deflect asteroids from Earth. “Today neither the United States nor Russia has the capability to shoot down such an object,” he warned, according to Interfax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Church of the Transfiguration in Chebarkul, on a hill overlooking the lake, Deacon Sergiy was in mid-service on Friday, having just closed the doors in a wall of icons symbolizing the entombment of Jesus in the holy sepulcher and the imminence of the Resurrection. Just then, a bright light spilled in through every window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was like a new sun was born,” he said. “This all gives us reason to think. Is the purpose of our life just to raise a family and die, or is it to live eternally? It was a reason for people on earth to look up, to look up at God.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the flash more significant than earlier signs he had noticed, like the time a white dove alighted on the church belfry, or when a cloud appeared above the church in the form of a cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the lake, an ice fisherman, who gave his name only as Dmitri, shrugged off the event. “A meteor fell,” he said. “So what? Who knows what can fall out of the sky? It didn’t hit anybody. That is the important thing,”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, scientists have been on the lookout for killer objects from outer space that could devastate the planet. But warnings that they lacked the tools to detect the most serious threats were largely ignored, even as skeptics mocked the worriers as Chicken Littles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No more. The meteor that rattled Siberia on Friday[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/world/europe/meteorite-fragments-are-said-to-rain-down-on-siberia.html], injuring hundreds of people and traumatizing thousands, has suddenly brought new life to efforts to deploy adequate detection tools, in particular a space telescope that would scan the solar system for dangers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group of young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who helped build thriving companies like <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> has already put millions of dollars into the effort and saw Friday’s shock wave as a turning point in raising hundreds of millions more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wouldn’t it be silly if we got wiped out because we weren’t looking?” said Edward Lu, a former NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] astronaut and <span class="companylink">Google</span> executive who leads the detection effort. “This is a wake-up call from space. We’ve got to pay attention to what’s out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers know of no asteroids or comets that pose a major threat to the planet. But NASA estimates that fewer than 10 percent of the big dangers have been discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lu’s group, called the B612 Foundation[http://b612foundation.org/] after the imaginary asteroid on which the Little Prince lived, is one team of several pursuing ways to ward off extraterrestrial threats. NASA is another, and other private groups are emerging, like Planetary Resources[http://www.planetaryresources.com/], which wants not only to identify asteroids near Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] but also to mine them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our job is to be the first line of defense, and we take that very seriously,” James Green, the director of planetary science at NASA headquarters, said in an interview Friday after the Russian strike. “No one living on this planet has ever before been hurt. That’s historic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green added that the Russian episode was sure to energize the field and that an even analysis of the meteor’s remains could help reveal clues about future threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our scientists are excited,” he said. “Russian planetary scientists are already collecting meteorites from this event.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow awakening to the danger began long ago, as scientists found hundreds of rocky scars indicating that cosmic intruders had periodically reshaped the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discoveries included not just obvious features like Meteor Crater[http://www.google.com/search?q=Meteor+Crater&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dqIfUdz5DYLy0wG1pYGIAw&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1050&amp;bih=1478] in Arizona, but wide zones of upheaval. A crater more than a hundred miles wide beneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico suggested that, 65 million years ago, a speeding rock from outer space had raised enough planetary mayhem to end the reign of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people remain skeptical of the cosmic threat and are glad for taxpayer money to go toward urgent problems on Earth rather than outer space. But many scientists who have examined the issues have become convinced that better precautions are warranted in much the same way that homeowners buy insurance for unlikely events that can result in severe damage to life and property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, astronomers turned their telescopes on the sky with increasing vigor to look for killer rocks. The rationale was statistical. They knew about a number of near misses and calculated that many other rocky threats whirling about the solar system had gone undetected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, with little fanfare, the Air Force also began scanning the skies for speeding rocks, giving credibility to an activity once seen as reserved for doomsday enthusiasts. It was the world’s first known government search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span> took a lead role with what it called the Spaceguard Survey. In 2007, it issued a report estimating that 20,000 asteroids and comets orbited close enough to the planet to deliver blows that could destroy cities or even end all life. Today, with limited financing, NASA supports modest telescopes in the southwestern United States and in Hawaii that make more than 95 percent of the discoveries of the objects coming near the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists lobbied hard for a space telescope that would get high above the distorting effects of the Earth’s atmosphere. It would orbit the Sun, peering across the solar system, and would have a much better chance of finding large space rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the nation immersed in two wars and other earthly priorities, the government financing never materialized. Last year, Dr. Lu, who left the NASA astronaut corps in 2007 to work for <span class="companylink">Google</span>, joined with veterans of the space program and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to accelerate the asteroid hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span> refers to its planned telescope as the world’s first private mission to deep space. Private groups, it says on its Web site, can carry out “audacious projects that previously only governments could accomplish — and at lower cost.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to launch a large telescope known as Sentinel that can find 90 percent of the asteroids larger than 460 feet in diameter that pass through the Earth’s part of the solar system. They also want to discover smaller asteroids down to a diameter of 100 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such asteroids are much bigger than the meteor that hit the atmosphere over Russia, and the telescope would thus be blind to those kinds of smaller threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last October, the <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span>, based in Mountain View, Calif., signed a contract with <span class="companylink">Ball Aerospace</span> to create prototype sensors for the Sentinel mission. The space telescope is to have a diameter of 20 inches. In theory, the system could be ready for launching by 2017 or 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Dr. Lu said the overall cost of the mission was now estimated at $450 million, including launching, insurance and operations. The group, far from that goal, has been soliciting money from citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday’s close approach to Earth of an asteroid named 2012 DA14, as well as the much smaller object whose shock wave broke windows and bones in Russia, prompted thousands of hits to the foundation’s Web site and <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account, said Diane Murphy, a spokeswoman for the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody is calling,” she said. “They see us as the solution. They’re saying, ‘When are you going to have the telescope up?’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B612 is just one player. Last April, Planetary Resources unveiled plans to mine asteroids that zip close by Earth, both to provide supplies for future interplanetary travelers and to bring back metals like platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture attracted some big-name investors, including Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of <span class="companylink">Google</span>. The company also has plans to develop telescopes that would hunt for rocky intruders coming near the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green of NASA said the agency was preparing to launch a mission in 2016 that will fly to an asteroid and, in 2023, return a sample to Earth for detailed analyses. The insights are expected to help scientists learn more about the makeup of the threats whizzing through the cosmic shooting gallery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you’re going to protect the planet, you have to know your enemy,” he said. “You have to get up close and personal.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW - There is nothing like a meteor to showcase national character. When one blew up in the sky over Chelyabinsk on Friday morning, the defining traits of Russian citizens emerged for all to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world learned that, as one headline in New York Magazine put it, "It's Almost Impossible to Startle a Russian."[http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/02/meteorite-russia-dashcam-no-reaction.html] Numerous dashboard video cameras captured a giant fireball shooting across the sky and blowing up while the driver listened to electro-pop dance music or simply waited for the light to change. To be fair, the video clip that went viral[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ybZgYRpgM.] in Russia was actually rather expressive: that driver let out an unimaginative but almost unimaginably long series of curses. Yet a majority of dashcam owners appear to have remained indifferent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Because they expect disaster to strike anytime. Russia has the highest rate of mortality from external causes - accidents, poisonings, and violence including suicide - of any country at peace[http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=446]. And residents of the Chelyabinsk region, where the meteor exploded, are perhaps more aware of this than other Russians: The area is home to some of the worst - and least known - nuclear disasters in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1957 a storage tank with nuclear waste exploded at the Mayak plant[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/mayak-nuclear-disaster280907/?accept=35e5ad5fe0cebd2b7d19b28bb447bb25], about 60 miles from Chelyabinsk, affecting 217 towns and at least 272,000 people. This accident is widely considered the second-worst nuclear disaster in history (Chernobyl being the worst). The plant also had several smaller accidents and regularly released nuclear waste into the nearby Techa river, sometimes called the most-polluted river in the world. Unlike in the area affected by the Chernobyl disaster, people continue to live around the Mayak plant, fish in the Techa and give birth to children with genetic abnormalities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is perhaps unsurprising that the second trait meteor witnesses manifested en masse was reckless fearlessness. More than 1,000 people were injured - most of them by broken glass, many if not most of them because they had rushed to the windows to check out the source of the unusual light and loud sound. Russian news outlets reported the single case of an elementary school teacher[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/after-the-meteor-some-in-chelyabinsk-prepare-to-clean-up/2013/02/16/bf0f1784-7857-11e2-aa12-e6cf1d31106b_story.html] who commanded her students to hide under their desks and rushed to open glass-paned doors, thereby, it is claimed, saving 44 children from injury. Observing standard disaster procedure was apparently unusual enough to elevate the teacher to hero status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have seen this recklessness many times. When someone was assassinated by a bomb across the street from the office in Moscow of a magazine I used to edit, I was the only one who dove under my desk; my colleagues ran to look out the windows. Once, when a fire alarm sounded in another building, the large crowd of reporters broke into two groups: The foreigners headed for the exits while the Russians remained oblivious. It bears mentioning that this followed a bombing in which hundreds of people died.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think there are two reasons for this behavior, and I am not sure which is the more important. One reason is a profound, learned helplessness: Russians do not generally expect to control what happens to them and see little point in trying. The other reason is a pervasive distrust of the authorities: The fire alarm is always presumed to be a false one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Several video clips purport to show that the meteor, or whatever it was, exploded because it was hit by a U.F.O. Watch on Youtube.[http://youtu.be/WaQIPBqoQ-Q]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which brings me to lack of trust, the third national trait brought out by Friday's meteor. State television has broadcast footage of a giant burning crater[http://tomsk.fm/watch/241314] and claimed the meteor landed there; in fact, it exploded in the stratosphere. Russian blogs are rife with speculation that the meteor was in fact a U.F.O. Alternatively, several video clips purport to show that the meteor, or whatever it was, exploded because it was hit by a U.F.O. "Were we saved?" asks the caption on one such clip[https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=WaQIPBqoQ-Q], set to dramatic music. Yes, indeed, the Chelyabinsk governor told his people - saved by God.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder conspiracy theories abound.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHELYABINSK, Russia -- The shock wave from a meteor that exploded above Siberia last week somehow sheared the roof off a brick and steel factory building while leaving a nearby glass facade unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some high-rises in this city, the first modern urban community to have felt the breath of a cosmic close encounter, every window blew out on the top floor; elsewhere, the ground floors suffered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More ominously, reports came in to local news media over the weekend of stranger phenomena: behind unshattered apartment windows, glass jugs were said to explode into shards, dishes to crack, electronics to die. Balconies rattled. One man said a bottle broke right in his hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anna V. Popova was at home with her daughter when she saw the flash, then heard explosions, then found the windows of her enclosed balcony blown in; her neighbor, with identical windows, escaped without property damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people suffered, not us alone,'' Ms. Popova said, but added that there seemed to be randomness in whose property was damaged. ''Who are we supposed to blame for all this? Nobody of course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists believe the space rock that tore through the atmosphere on Friday morning and blew apart here was the largest to have entered the atmosphere since 1908 and that it was unusual as well for the scale of its effects: more than 1,200 people injured and broad property damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the event is providing a first indication of the type of structural and infrastructural costs meteors can exact from a highly industrialized society. NASA scientists say a meteor of this size strikes the Earth about once every hundred years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shattered glass caused most of the damage and injuries here in Chelyabinsk, a sprawling industrial city of about a million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What shattered the glass, scientists say, was both the explosion as the meteor fragmented and the waves of pressure created as it decelerated. Such low-frequency waves -- called infrasound -- are sometimes detected by cold-war era nuclear blast sensors in remote parts of the Pacific Ocean or Alaska, according to meteor experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waves can bounce off buildings and be stronger in some places than others; they can also resonate with glass, explaining why bottles and dishes might have shattered inside undamaged kitchens, as if crushed by the airy hand of the meteor itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A shock wave is like a ball,'' Aleksandr Y. Dudorov, director of the theoretical physics department at Chelyabinsk State University, said in an interview. ''Throw a ball into a room and it will bounce from one wall to another.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia has mobilized 24,000 emergency officials to inspect roads, railroads, hospitals, factories and military facilities. Most are undamaged, including 122 sites identified as particularly critical, including nuclear power plants, dams and chemical factories, and a space launching site called Strela.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Sunday, Russia's consumer safety inspection agency, <span class="companylink">Rospotrebnadzor</span>, released a statement saying the water in Lake Chebarkul, where a hole in the ice appeared on Friday, was not radioactive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unclear why the agency released this finding only Sunday, or whether the tests were conducted to assuage popular concerns or out of any real official uncertainty over what happened on Friday. In any case, the agency said a mobile laboratory quietly dispatched to the lake tested for but did not discover cesium 137 and strontium 90, isotopes created in nuclear explosions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infrasound waves have not previously been studied in a cityscape, Richard P. Binzel, a professor of planetary science at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and an author of a textbook on asteroids and meteorites, said in a telephone interview. But he noted that the apparent randomness of the damage was consistent with the way such waves function.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A shock wave can be coming from a particular direction, and if you face that direction you are more susceptible,'' Dr. Binzel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One building might shadow another, or you may have a street that is optimally aligned to channel the wave, either in a fortunate or unfortunate way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Brown, a professor of physics at the University of Western Ontario, wrote in an e-mail that an infrasound wave ''is very efficient at traveling long distances,'' and that ''windows, structures or even glass jars susceptible to resonate at this frequency could be a factor to seemingly random damage at widely disparate locations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brown studied a similar, though smaller, explosion of a meteor over the Pacific Ocean on Oct. 8, 2009, which also sent out low-frequency waves, though too remote to affect homes or industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were, though, registered by a network of infrasound sensors established to monitor compliance with the international ban on nuclear tests, according to Dr. Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alekdander V. Anusiyev, the spokesman for the governor of Chelyabinsk region, characterized the damage here as without a discernible pattern. ''It is impossible to say more glass broke in one part of the city or another,'' he said. ''Glass broke everywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roof of the zinc factory that collapsed was reinforced with a lattice of steel beams and supported by concrete joists that are now broken, jutting upward with mangled re-bar protruding. Windows on a neighboring house blew in with such force that the frames went with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet a few yards away on Sverdlovsky Street, the cosmos spared a seemingly vulnerable Hundai dealership, a three-story cube sheathed in glass, with glistening display models inside. Not a window broke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People can consider Feb. 15 their second birthday,'' the governor of Chelyabinsk, Mikhail Yurevich, told reporters, referring to the day of the meteor strike. ''God directed danger away.''</p>
<p>Workers sealed a broken window in a school in Chelyabinsk, Russia, on Sunday.  Most of the 1,200 injured on Friday were hurt by shattered glass. (PHOTOGRAPH BY SERGEI ILNITSKY/EUROPEAN PRESS AGENCY)   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did you watch the videos of the meteor that lit up the sky over Siberia last week? If you're like many people, you went straight to <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, where dozens of amateur videos were uploaded soon after the rare occurrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most-viewed of all the videos, uploaded by the cable channel Russia Today,[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Omh7_I8vI] has received more than 26 million views. On Tuesday, an online measurement company, Visible Measures, reported that the meteor videos had collectively topped 138 million views on the video-sharing sites it tracks, like <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and <span class="companylink">DailyMotion</span>. Visible Measures declared that the meteor was "the fastest video event ever to reach 100 million views."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a testament to the growth of online video and to the unique qualities of the "video event," as the measurement company put it. According to NASA, the meteor weighed about 7,000 tons; as Andrew E. Kramer reported in Tuesday's New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/world/europe/in-russia-property-ruined-and-spared-by-meteor-share-space.html?ref=europe], it was "the largest known celestial body to enter Earth's atmosphere in 100 years." The astonishing shock wave that accompanied it injured more than a thousand people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> and sites like it, viewers around the world could see the meteor from dozens of angles. Visible Measures counted more than 400 uploaded videos of the meteor, though some of those may have been duplicates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Television networks quickly pulled together highlight reels of the videos for their newscasts, further extending the reach of the amateur videos. News Web sites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com did the same thing. But Visible Measures does not count news Web sites, so the fact that the amateur videos topped 100 million views by its count shows that many Web users like to see the source material for newscasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Velocity is a big factor with massive online events," the company said in a blog post Tuesday.[http://corp.visiblemeasures.com/news-and-events/blog/bid/95497/Russian-Meteor-Becomes-Fastest-Video-Event-Ever-to-Top-100-Million-Views] "The more urgency people feel to be part of the conversation and to be a part of the moment, the more views a video event will generate. We saw the same story play out with Kony and Stratos."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kony was a campaign by a nonprofit group to raise awareness about Joseph Kony, the head of the Lord's Resistance Army, an African guerrilla group. Videos related to the campaign topped 100 million views in six days last year. Stratos was a daredevil's record-breaking jump from the stratosphere,[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/us/felix-baumgartner-skydiving.html] sponsored and televised by Red Bull. Videos related to the jump topped 100 million views in five days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the meteor had something those campaigns didn't," Visible Measures said. "We all had to watch it, in shock, awe and terror."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's data showed that the meteor videos gained 73 million views on Saturday, one day after the incident gained worldwide headlines. That one-day total was a record, the company said. "Kony previously held that record with 41.3 million views in a single day. Red Bull's Stratos comes in a close third with 40.9 million views."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEPUTATSKOYE, Russia -- Ever since the meteor exploded somewhere over this impoverished Siberian town, Larisa V. Briyukova wondered what to do with the fist-size stone she found under a hole in the roof tiles of her woodshed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, a stranger knocked on her door, offering about $60, Ms. Briyukova said. After some haggling, they settled on a price of $230. A few hours later, another man pulled up, looked at the hole in the roof and offered $1,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I regret selling it,'' said Ms. Briyukova, a 43-year-old homemaker. ''But then, who knows? The police might have come and taken it away anyway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, terror rained from the skies, blowing out windows and scaring people over an enormous swath of Siberia. But by Monday, for many people what fell from the sky had turned to pure gold, and it touched off a rush to retrieve the fragments, many buried in deep February snows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those out prospecting looked a lot like Sasha Zarezina, 8, who happily plunged into a snowbank here in this village of a thousand, laughing, kicking and throwing up plumes of powdery snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then she stopped, bent over and started to dig. ''I found one!'' she yelled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warm breath and a rub on her pants later, a small black pebble, oval like a river rock, charred and smooth, was freed of ice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trade in material from meteorites is largely illegal, there is a flourishing global market, with fragments widely available for sale on the Internet, usually at modest prices. At least one from the recent meteor was available on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> on Monday for $32, and there is a Web site called Star-bits.com devoted to the trade -- much to the displeasure of scientists and the countries where the objects were found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on, NASA reported that the meteor, the largest known celestial body to enter Earth's atmosphere in 100 years, was an airburst fireball type that would shower untold thousands of fragments onto the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the scramble now under way to find them, residents of towns like this one -- founded in the 1920s around a collective dairy farm that is now defunct -- are looking for small holes in the snow that hold the promise of yielding up polished black rocks encased in tiny clumps of ice, formed from the last expiring heat of their long journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All it takes is looking carefully,'' said Sasha, who was out searching after school on Monday. ''The stones are in the snowdrifts. To find a stone you find a hole. And then you dig.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Villagers here have plastic bags, matchboxes and jars filled with dozens of stones. One even tore a hole in the coat one woman was wearing outside Friday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is Russia, so the excitement became tinged with anxiety on Monday as unknown cars appeared, cruising the streets and bearing men who refused to answer questions but offered stacks of rubles worth hundreds, then thousands, of dollars for the fragments. Strangely, no authorities were anywhere in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">M3-Media, a financial news site, reported that under Russian law a person can gain legal title to a meteorite, but only if it is reported to the authorities and submitted to a laboratory for tests. The laboratory will charge 20 percent of the estimated value of the object for certification, the site reported, citing the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In practice, though, the search for remnants of the meteor has become a haphazard, unregulated scramble, wholly lacking coordinated effort or scientific oversight in the collection of specimens from one of the most significant events in years for the community of scientists who study such things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have a mechanism to prevent this from happening,'' said Viktor Grokhovsky, an assistant professor of metallurgy at Southern Ural Federal University, one of the scientists who made the positive identification of meteorites on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law enforcement agencies actually blocked scientists from visiting a suspected impact site on Lake Chebarkul over the weekend, Professor Grokhovsky said. Yet here at Deputatskoye, where the first scientific expedition is planned for Tuesday, not a police officer was in sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We send up spaceships to asteroids to obtain this material, at great expense, and here it flew right to us,'' he said. ''It would be nice if the government coordinated with us, the scientists. When we want to be somewhere, they won't let us near. When we want them to be somewhere, they are nowhere to be found.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out on the streets a man reeking of alcohol sidled up to a foreigner. Shifting his cigarette from his right hand to his left, he fished from a pocket a rock the size of a goose egg, its surface as smooth, dark and mysterious as onyx. It was for sale, he said. He did not give a price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fragments landed in a social landscape of distrust of the authorities, where police corruption is widespread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With word of the rising prices rippling through the village, some women, looking with piercing, paranoid eyes at strangers, refused to speak about what their children might have found. Others expressed fear that the police would confiscate the stones -- and in turn sell them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody knows anything; nobody says anything,'' one said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another said, unconvincingly, ''We threw our stones away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intact meteor, estimated by NASA to weigh about 7,000 tons, bore immense energy as it entered the atmosphere over Alaska. It was the largest source of infrasound waves -- low-frequency waves of pressure -- ever recorded by a system set up globally to monitor compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. But after the meteor exploded, the small bits of debris slowed to terminal velocity, about the speed of a piece of gravel dropped from a skyscraper. Such remnants would not create craters on touchdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All about, tracks meander through the deep snow, ending at tiny excavations two or three feet deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They fell everywhere in the village,'' Alfia N. Zharkova, a mother of two, who has a plastic bag filled with black stones, said in an interview in her kitchen. ''The children find them. Everybody who has children has piles of these.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She found one Friday. ''I went out to feed the cow and I see a hole in the ice,'' Ms. Zharkova said. ''And there's a stone in the hole. So I just reach down and pick it up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A neighbor, Aleksandra Gerasimova, a 61-year-old retired milkmaid, said a meteorite tore a hole in her coat, which she displayed Monday. She was wearing it Friday when she stepped outside to investigate the flash in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was standing with my husband, and some of it fell on us,'' Ms. Gerasimova said. ''This rock fell down and into my jacket. I felt it hit me. I looked up, and there was nothing above me, not a bird, nothing. Imagine how frightened I was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, two men, apparently speculators, showed up at her house and offered to buy her stone. ''I didn't open the door,'' she said. ''Why should I sell it? I have a grandson I will give it to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the school bus pulled up Monday afternoon, children shot out and scattered over the snowy fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Sasha, a boisterous girl in a maroon jacket and tan checkered pants, found the small pebble in the snow, she said she intended to ''save it for my own children,'' but quickly reconsidered. ''I will sell it for 100 million euros.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now I have snow in my boot,'' the little Russian girl confessed, but added: ''I'm used to the cold. I like the cold. I grew up in the cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't mind it at all.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a momentous week for asteroids -- one that struck Earth, and one that didn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday morning, people of the Russian city of Chelyabinsk looked up to see a bright object streak across the sky. About a minute later, they were buffeted by a thunderous shock wave that shattered windows and caused hundreds of injuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists used recordings of ultra-low-frequency sound waves to estimate that the asteroid that entered the atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour was 55 feet wide, weighed 10,000 tons, and released energy 30 times that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers had no chance of spotting the asteroid beforehand, because it came from the same direction as the rising Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even larger asteroid, designated 2012 DA14, which astronomers had been diligently tracking, passed a close, but not too close, 17,200 miles from Earth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEDICINE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Way to See</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a bionic eye, but it is a first technological step to restoring vision for the blind. On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration approved what amounts to an artificial retina -- special glasses that contain a camera and a video processor, which send signals to a sheet of electrodes that have been implanted in the eyes. The electrodes send the signals to the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment is the first to give sight to the blind, although only rudimentary aspects -- the outlines of objects and contrasts between light and dark. Still, that is enough to enable at least some of the blind patients using the device to detect street crosswalks, the presence of people or cars, or even to read large type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVOLUTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Multitalented Gene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single gene mutation 35,000 years ago appears to help explain the distinctive appearance of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and other East Asian people. Scientists engineered mice with the East Asian version of this gene, called EDAR, and these mice indeed had thicker hair shafts characteristic of East Asians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the surprise of the researchers, the genetically engineered mice also had more sweat glands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese member of the research team tested people in China and found that they had more numerous sweat glands than people elsewhere. The researchers said the mutation occurred in central China, where extra sweat glands would have been a boon to the hunter-gatherers who lived in the warm, humid region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASTRONOMY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Name That Moon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Shatner may get to name a moon of Pluto. In 2011 and 2012, astronomers at the <span class="companylink">SETI Institute</span> in Mountain View, Calif., using the Hubble Space Telescope, spotted two undiscovered bodies orbiting the former planet and designated them P4 and P5 -- the fourth and fifth known moons of Pluto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute is inviting the public to vote on more permanent names in a poll at plutorocks.com. Voting ends at noon on Feb. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In classical mythology, Pluto is the lord of the underworld, so the nine names proposed by the astronomers included Styx (the river that divides Earth from the underworld) and Cerberus (the three-headed dog guarding the gates to the underworld).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shatner, best known as Capt. James T. Kirk of ''Star Trek,'' suggested Vulcan and Romulus, the names of fictional worlds on the show; Romulus is taken (it's a moon around an asteroid), but the astronomers took him up on Vulcan, adding that to the poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the more than 288,500 ballots cast as of Monday afternoon, Vulcan led the tally with more than 87,000 votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the polls close next Monday, the astronomers will confer with the <span class="companylink">International Astronomical Union</span> on the final names.</p>
<p>Perch exposed to an anti-anxiety drug  were more active and a meteor struck in  Russia. In other news, a single gene mutation  may explain East Asians' thick hair,  and the blind got a helping device.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEDICINE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Way to See</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not a bionic eye, but it is a first technological step to restoring vision for the blind. On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration approved what amounts to an artificial retina[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/health/fda-approves-technology-to-give-limited-vision-to-blind-people.html?ref=science] — special glasses that contain a camera and a video processor, which send signals to a sheet of electrodes that have been implanted in the eyes. The electrodes send the signals to the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment is the first to give sight to the blind, although only rudimentary aspects — the outlines of objects and contrasts between light and dark. Still, that is enough to enable at least some of the blind patients using the device to detect street crosswalks, the presence of people or cars, or even to read large type.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVOLUTION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Multitalented Gene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single gene mutation 35,000 years ago appears to help explain the distinctive appearance of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and other East Asian people. Scientists engineered mice with the East Asian version of this gene, called EDAR, and these mice indeed had thicker hair shafts characteristic of East Asians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the surprise of the researchers[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/science/studying-recent-human-evolution-at-the-genetic-level.html?ref=science], the genetically engineered mice also had more sweat glands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chinese member of the research team tested people in China and found that they had more numerous sweat glands than people elsewhere. The researchers said the mutation occurred in central China, where extra sweat glands would have been a boon to the hunter-gatherers who lived in the warm, humid region.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In classical mythology, Pluto is the lord of the underworld, so the nine names proposed by the astronomers included Styx (the river that divides Earth from the underworld) and Cerberus (the three-headed dog guarding the gates to the underworld).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shatner, best known as Capt. James T.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can humans do better than the dinosaurs[http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/animal_forecast/2013/02/dinosaur_extinction_was_an_asteroid_the_only_cause_of_the_cretaceous_mass.html]?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is one of a string of questions I posed in a Skype chat on Sunday with Russell L. Schweickart[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/opinion/26schweickart.html], the Apollo 9 astronaut who has become a leading proponent of investing in tools that can spot and deflect earthbound asteroids and other orbiting threats. We spoke shortly after the cosmic coincidence on Feb. 15, when a long-projected close flyby by the DA14 asteroid was upstaged[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/news/asteroid20130215.html] by the meteor that disintegrated over Siberia. [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/15/world/europe/16meteorite_videogrid.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Video: Watch on Youtube.[http://youtu.be/QP2RAhx-GDI]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schweickart, along with former space shuttle astronaut Edward Lu[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/l/edward_t_lu/index.html] and others, has for years pursued the goal of creating the technological capacity (through a privately financed Sentinel space telescope mission[http://b612foundation.org/sentinelmission/]) and encouraging governmental responsibility (through discussions with NASA, the United Nations[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50840661/ns/technology_and_science-space/] and other relevant entities) to address this long-understood, but largely discounted, threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My first question was whether Schweickart saw the cosmic events last week as changing the equation. He was hopeful but doubtful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below you can read transcribed portions of our conversation, including Schweickart's views on why developing a system for spotting and deflecting near-Earth objects has been a tough sell both at NASA and in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a closer look at the planetary-protection efforts of Schweickart, Lu and their allies, I encourage you to read William J. Broad's recent feature, "Vindication for Entrepreneurs Watching Sky: Yes, It Can Fall.[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/science/space/dismissed-as-doomsayers-advocates-for-meteor-detection-feel-vindicated.html]"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also recommend Lu's TEDx talk on the Sentinel space telescope project[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAlF4xxRTwI], and explore background posted by the B612 Foundation[http://b612foundation.org/sentinelmission/], the group co-founded by Lu, Schweickart and others,[http://b612foundation.org/our-story/] first to explore deflection options and, since 2011, focused on the telescope mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My central question for Schweickart was:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can we be smarter than the dinosaurs? We clearly have the foresight to recognize this is possible but now can we actually be smarter? Intelligence is taking knowledge and doing something with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He replied:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We clearly have both the knowledge and the capability to protect the Earth from these impacts. The bigger question is will we really recognize our shared interest in survival to cooperate internationally to make decisions and protect life on earth . We're broken into nations and tribes of all kinds and sizes and whether we can recognize our common humanity to the point where we do better than the dinosaurs, there's not a clear answer to that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He laid out the three-pronged approach that's required:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three fundamental elements to protecting the Earth from these things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Number one is having adequate early warning. That's what our Project Sentinel infrared telescope is all about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second one is once you know something's coming at you, you have to have a way to prevent it, and that's deflection. And right now, while we know how to deflect -- and the B612 Foundation was a major cohort in developing those capabilities -- nevertheless it's never been demonstrated . Public safety is a fundamental responsibility of government everywhere. And to me NASA needs to be given the clear responsibilty to protect the earth from a predicted impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the third is the most challenging issue: the international coordination . The easiest way to state it is that you can't deflect an asteroid without putting temporarily at risk other nations and people who were not initially threatened that international complexity says there has to be some ultimately we may watch ourselves get hit with the first one that threatens, hopefully in the ocean, while everybody is still debating at the U.N. But hopefully that will only happen once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recalled how, in 2004, Schweickart described a Senate hearing on strategies for spotting and deflecting near-Earth objects as a sad affair in which lawmakers were concerned publicly, but privately said there was no way to get the money for an ambitious program. Why is planetary protection seen as a boondoggle, I asked?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He replied:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not officially on anybody's to-do list in terms of legal requirements. NASA does have a legal requirement to discover asteroids and to do certain research work, track them and catalog them, etc., but NASA does not have responsibility nor does anyone else, to protect the Earth from potential impacts. This is really public safety. This is not science or exploration. It's always been a sad sister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Siberian meteor blast might boost prospects, but was doubtful it would have a lasting effect on spending, particularly given other pressures in Washington:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the financial situation in the federal government, not to mention the tremendous partisan contention going on, and the sequestration and everything else, this is a tough time for anybody to propose spending money that isn't already committed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schweickart added that's where the Sentinel mission, for which the nonprofit B612 Foundation is trying to raise $450 million, comes in:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one of the nice things about being a private entity. We can focus on something that's of very great importance and we can see it through, notwithstanding the rapidly changing political environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He concluded by describing how the Sentinel mission could, within a decade, identify a huge number of orbiting objects that cannot be detected now but could have the destructive power of the Tunguska object, which exploded over Siberia in 1908[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/apocalypse-then-next-one-when/], flattening hundreds of square miles of forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we can get our B612 telescope into orbit by 2018, by the time we get to 2020, 2022, we'll have something like 50 percent of the Tunguska-size objects - things like DA14 [the 50-meter-diameter asteroid that passed between Earth and some satellites on Friday]. Having 50 percent is a lot better than what we have now which is less than one half of one percent of objects that size. These are not panic situations, but they can hit any day, as we found out last Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents in some Siberian towns in Russia are searching for meteorite fragments buried in deep snow and lodged in roof tiles after last Friday’s fiery explosion in the sky. Speculators are offering upward of a thousand dollars for pebbles, and Russians are pondering what to do with the treasure they find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you ever found something valuable?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the meteor exploded somewhere over this impoverished Siberian town, Larisa V. Briyukova wondered what to do with the fist-size stone she found under a hole in the roof tiles of her woodshed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, a stranger knocked on her door, offering about $60, Ms. Briyukova said. After some haggling, they settled on a price of $230. A few hours later, another man pulled up, looked at the hole in the roof and offered $1,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now I regret selling it,” said Ms. Briyukova, a 43-year-old homemaker. “But then, who knows? The police might have come and taken it away anyway.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, terror rained from the skies, blowing out windows and scaring people over an enormous swath of Siberia.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At lunchtime on Friday, things were not looking good: a rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station was having problems with its thrusters, imperiling its ability to get where it was going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake were some treats for the astronauts -- fresh fruit plus other food and clothing, parts for air purifiers and some science experiments -- as well as the reputation of the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, a company NASA has hired to ferry supplies to the space station (and, eventually, people). If the thrusters could not be fixed, the cargo would never arrive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the drama subsided quickly. By late Friday afternoon, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> reported that it had fixed the problem and that the balky thrusters had merely delayed the arrival of the cargo ship at the station by perhaps just one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching had gone fine. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off on schedule at 10:10 a.m. on Friday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and 10 minutes later deposited the cargo ship -- a capsule called Dragon -- into orbit around Earth. The idea was for the Dragon, carrying 1,500 pounds of cargo, to adjust its orbit through a series of thruster firings and arrive at the space station on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, soon after the capsule separated from the rocket, engineers at <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> noticed that only one of the four groups of thrusters was ready to begin firing. NASA requires that at least three groups of thrusters be working before it will allow the capsule anywhere near the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a little frightening there,'' Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, said during a telephone news conference after the launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said that there seemed to be a blockage or stuck valve, but that repeatedly opening and closing valves to the propellant tanks cleared the problem with the thrusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're actually looking quite good,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at NASA and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said they would discuss when to reschedule the space station rendezvous, which will now occur on Sunday at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the biggest glitch that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has faced so far in its cargo flights. Last May, it made its first successful trip to the space station to demonstrate its readiness and followed up in October with the first delivery under a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October mission was successful despite the failure of one of nine engines on the Falcon 9 rocket. The rocket's computer shut down the malfunctioning engines, and the other eight were able to compensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Friday's cargo ship episode was not the only headache for NASA this week. Farther away, NASA's robotic rover on Mars, the Curiosity, also experienced a serious mishap. On Thursday, the rover put itself in ''safe mode,'' when it discovered the memory in its computer had malfunctioned. The mission controllers switched to the other computer -- the rover contains two for redundancy -- and it will take several days before the rover resumes its scientific work.</p>

By late Friday afternoon, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> reported that it had fixed the problem and that the balky thrusters had merely delayed the arrival of the cargo ship at the station by perhaps just one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching had gone fine. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off on schedule at 10:10 a.m. on Friday from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and 10 minutes later deposited the cargo ship — a capsule called Dragon — into orbit around Earth. The idea was for the Dragon, carrying 1,500 pounds of cargo, to adjust its orbit through a series of thruster firings and arrive at the space station on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, soon after the capsule separated from the rocket, engineers at <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> noticed that only one of the four groups of thrusters was ready to begin firing. NASA requires that at least three groups of thrusters be working before it will allow the capsule anywhere near the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was a little frightening there,” Elon Musk[http://elonmusk.com/], chief executive of SpaceX, said during a telephone news conference after the launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk said that there seemed to be a blockage or stuck valve, but that repeatedly opening and closing valves to the propellant tanks cleared the problem with the thrusters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re actually looking quite good,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at NASA and <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> said they would discuss when to reschedule the space station rendezvous, which will now occur on Sunday at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the biggest glitch that <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has faced so far in its cargo flights. Last May, it made its first successful trip to the space station to demonstrate its readiness and followed up in October with the first delivery under a $1.6 billion contract for a dozen cargo deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October mission was successful despite the failure of one of nine engines on the Falcon 9 rocket. The rocket’s computer shut down the malfunctioning engines, and the other eight were able to compensate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Friday’s cargo ship episode was not the only headache for NASA this week. Farther away, NASA’s robotic rover on Mars, the Curiosity, also experienced a serious mishap. On Thursday, the rover put itself in “safe mode,” when it discovered the memory in its computer had malfunctioned. The mission controllers switched to the other computer — the rover contains two for redundancy — and it will take several days before the rover resumes its scientific work.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their bones, physicists feel it is the long-lost Higgs boson[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/higgs_boson/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], but in science, feelings take second place to data. So these same physicists admit that it will take more work and analysis before they will have the cold numbers that clinch the case that the new particle announced on July 4[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/science/cern-physicists-may-have-discovered-higgs-boson-particle.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0] last year is in fact the exact boson first predicted by Peter Higgs and others in 1964 to be the arbiter of mass and cosmic diversity. “Personally, I have no problems calling this a Higgs boson,” said Joe Incandela, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and spokesman, or leader, of one of the teams, known as CMS, that reported the new particle last July. “If it’s not, I won’t mind eating my words, because it would be so much more interesting.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He spoke on the eve of the Moriond[https://indico.in2p3.fr/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=741] workshop in La Thuile, Italy, where on Wednesday CERN[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/cern/index.html?inline=nyt-org] physicists will present[http://webcast.in2p3.fr/live/rencontres_de_moriond_2013] the latest analysis of some 2,000 trillion collisions recorded by the Large Hadron Collider[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/large_hadron_collider/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. There could still be surprises, but so far, physicists say, the particle is on target with the predictions of the Standard Model, the current reigning theory in physics. Which is a triumph for the theorists who invented the boson, but might be a disappointment for those who dream of revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are in post-discovery depression,” said Eilam Gross, one of the CERN physicists on the Atlas team. “What happens when you search for something and then it turns out to be exactly what you are looking for?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened in the first instant of the Big Bang? What happens at the middle of a black hole where matter and time blink in or out of existence? What is the dark matter[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_matter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] whose gravitational influence, astronomers say, shapes the structures of galaxies, or the dark energy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_energy_astronomy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that is forcing the universe apart? Why is the universe full of matter but not antimatter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what, finally, is the fate of the universe? These are all questions that the Standard Model, the vanilla-sounding set of equations that ruled physics for the last half century, does not answer. Some of them could be answered by the unproven theory called supersymmetry, which among other things is needed to explain why whatever mass the Higgs has is low enough to be discovered in the first place and not almost infinite. It predicts a whole new population of elementary particles — called superpartners to the particles physicists already know about — one of which could be the dark matter[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/dark_matter/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that pervades the universe. If such particles exist, they would affect the rate at which Higgs bosons decay into other particles, but the CERN teams have yet to record what they consider a convincing deviation from the Standard Model predictions for those decays. Supersymmetry is still at best a beautiful idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing that has hampered progress is that physicists still do not agree on how much the new particle weighs. Eyebrows were raised in December when the Atlas team reported that their two different methods of measuring the boson’s mass do not agree. They get a mass of 126.6 billion electron volts by watching for it to decay into a pair of gamma rays, and 123.5 billion electron volts when they look for a signature of four charged particles. The spread of more than three billion electron volts means the error bars for the two measurements do not overlap. The results from the rival CMS are closer together, in the middle, consistent with a mass of 125.8 billion electron volts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlas physicists say the effect is most likely a statistical fluctuation that will be cured eventually with more data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it matter how much a Higgs boson weighs? It could determine the fate of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2011, shortly after CERN teams first declared that they had seen signs of the famous boson with a mass of 125 billion electron volts, Gian Giudice, a CERN theorist, and his colleagues ran the numbers and concluded that the universe was in a precarious condition and could be prone to collapse in the far, far future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason lies in the Higgs field, the medium of which the Higgs boson is the messenger and which determines the structure of empty space, i.e., the vacuum.</p>

The Higgs field, like everything else in nature, is lazy, and, like water running downhill, always seeks to be in the state of lowest energy. Physicists assume that the Higgs field today is in the lowest state possible, but Dr. Giudice found that was not the case. What counts as rock bottom in today’s universe could turn out to be just a plateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our universe is like a rock perched precariously on a mountaintop, he explained, in what physicists call a metastable state. The Higgs field could drop to a lower value by a process known as quantum tunneling, although it is not imminent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Giudice’s calculations suggest that it would take much longer than the age of the universe; the whole Milky Way galaxy could disappear into a black hole long before then. Which is good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that should happen — tomorrow or billions of years from now — a bubble would sweep out through the universe at the speed of light, obliterating the laws of nature as we know them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports of this work caused a flurry in the press. As Jeremy Bernstein, the noted physicist and author, wrote in a recent e-mail after reading the news, “Help!!!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it’s not time to dial up a Mayan priest for guidance yet.

Theories like supersymmetry or string theory could intercede at higher energies and change the outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The calculations also depend crucially on the mass of the top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle, as well as the Higgs, neither of which have been weighed precisely enough yet to determine the fate of the universe. If the top quark were just a little lighter or the Higgs a little heavier, 130 billion electron volts, Dr. Giudice said, the vacuum would in fact be stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s a puzzle, he said, why the universe exists in such a critical state. In an e-mail, Dr. Giudice wrote, “Why do we happen to live at the edge of collapse?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went on, “In my view, the message about near-criticality of the universe is the most important thing we have learned from the discovery of the Higgs boson so far.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guido Tonelli of CERN and the University of Pisa, said, “If true, it is somehow magic.” We wouldn’t be having this discussion, he said, if there hadn’t been enough time already for this universe to produce galaxies, stars, planets and “human beings who are attempting to produce a vision of the world,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So, in some sense, we are here, because we have been lucky, because for this particular universe the lottery produced a certain set of numbers, which allow the universe to have an evolution, which is very long.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- As Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist, used to say, the most overwhelming obstacle to exploring the cosmos isn't gravity. It's the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Bas Lansdorp began dreaming more than a decade ago about establishing the first permanent human colony on Mars, his primary focus was not on overcoming the technological challenges. It was the business model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the technology we need exists already -- or nearly exists,'' he said. ''I just couldn't figure out how to finance it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp, a 36-year-old Dutch engineer and entrepreneur, does not have the name recognition of Dennis Tito, the American financier and space tourist, who announced a plan last month to send two people on a round-trip Mars flyby in 2018. Nor can Mr. Lansdorp hope to match the deep pockets of Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, who has proposed sending as many as 80,000 people to the Red Planet and charging them $500,000 each. Richard Branson, the Virgin entrepreneur, has space aspirations, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lansorp is convinced that he has found the perfect plan to raise the $6 billion he says he needs to land an initial crew of four people on the Martian surface by 2023. The entire mission -- from the astronauts' selection and training to their arrival and construction of a permanent settlement -- would be broadcast as a worldwide, multiyear reality television show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many people do you think would want to watch the first humans arrive on Mars?'' Mr. Lansdorp asked in a recent interview, recalling the more than 600 million viewers who were said to have tuned in to the grainy, black-and-white images of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This will be one of the biggest events in human history,'' he said. ''We are talking about creating a major media spectacle, much bigger than the moon landings or the Olympics, and with huge potential for revenues coming from TV rights and sponsorships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the record, Mr. Lansdorp will be executive producer, not an actor, in this extravaganza: He does not plan to make the trip himself. And despite the significant skepticism his plan has raised in some quarters, he cites his success in starting and cashing out of the wind-energy company Ampyx Power -- a company trying to use pilotless, tethered aircraft to generate electricity -- as evidence that he can turn lofty ideas into financially viable realities. Mr. Lansdorp declined to say how much he had made selling his stake in Ampyx, a privately held company, other than indicating it had been enough that he would not have to work for at least several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just 10 years to select and prepare its first crew, the project, called Mars One, expects to begin recruiting prospective astronauts online this spring. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, be physically fit and speak English, and they must be willing to live out the final selection process and an eight-year training program -- not to mention the Mars mission itself -- under the constant stare of a television camera. No specific technical skills or experience are required, but be sure to read the fine print: For reasons of cost and logistics, this is a one-way trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Reality meets talent show, with no ending and the whole world watching,'' is how Paul Romer, a Dutch television executive and the co-creator of the original ''Big Brother'' series, describes it in an endorsement on the Mars One Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Mars One is raising more eyebrows than cash. Until this year, the project was financed almost entirely by Mr. Lansdorp himself. Last month, Mars One secured its first commitments from outside investors, and those funds will be used to finance the first conceptual design studies for the various hardware components, including the spacecraft and lander, life support systems, supply vehicles and communications systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site has received about 1.7 million unique visitors since it went live last June, according to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Analytics. But more than 8,000 people, from more than 100 countries, have already e-mailed résumés since online recruiting began in January. Dr. Norbert Kraft, a specialist in aerospace medicine and a former researcher at NASA, as well as the space agencies of Japan and Russia, leads a team of experts who will vet applicants for their basic suitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a big trip,'' Dr. Kraft said. ''They will have to be really ready for that physically and psychologically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool will be narrowed to a few hundred candidates by 2014, at which point Mars One hopes to begin televising the process in select countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick du Plooy, a medical student applying from Pretoria, South Africa, confessed that he was not a huge fan of standard-fare reality TV and hoped Mars One would be ''held to a higher quality standard.'' Mr. Plooy, 22, said he imagined the grueling routine of his coming medical internship and residency years would help him prepare for the rigors of life as an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp has set up Mars One as a nonprofit foundation, but it is the controlling shareholder in a for-profit company, Interplanetary Media Group, that owns the exclusive right to sell mission broadcast and advertising rights. Just how much those rights might be worth is anyone's guess -- but Mars One is betting that it is a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp cites a report published last year by the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> that said the winter and summer Games -- three-week events, staged every two years -- had generated about $5 billion in revenue from 2009 to 2012, of which more than $3.9 billion had come from the sale of broadcast rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more direct comparison, reality TV, has generated significant revenue for broadcasters for years. Although past its peak, the British version of ''Big Brother'' generated in 2006 as much as a fourth of the annual advertising revenue for the country's publicly owned Channel 4 network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Viacom</span>, the American media company, attributed much of the double-digit growth in its cable television ad sales in recent years to the success of ''Jersey Shore,'' which ended a six-year run on MTV television in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not everyone is convinced that Snooki in Space would fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea of flying to Mars one-way is not as outlandish as it may appear,'' said Robert Zubrin, former chairman of the United States National Space Society and a longtime advocate of a privately financed human mission to Mars. And he argues that it could be done with a budget ''in the single-digit billions'' of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I am very skeptical that it can be financed by broadcast revenues,'' he said. ''The initial mission could get great deal of attention. But how long could you sustain interest in a Martian 'Little House on the Prairie' at the level of revenues that would be required?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp winces a little at the reality-show label. ''It's a very difficult tradeoff between the goals of the project and to finance this mission,'' he conceded. ''This is not 'Big Brother Goes to Mars.' It's important this is treated as a very serious project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is for that reason, he said, that Mars One is focusing first on gaining credibility with prospective investors, sponsors and aerospace suppliers. Mr. Lansdorp declined to say how much he had budgeted for the initial publicity campaign, but experts like Mr. Zubrin estimate that it might take $30 million to $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Meijer, chief operating officer of the Dutch unit of <span class="companylink">Trifork</span>, a software developer based in Copenhagen, said his company -- which is also supplying Web-host and network technology for Mars One -- agreed to invest an undisclosed sum with the goal of raising its own profile through association with the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are not many of these kind of projects around,'' Mr. Meijer said. ''For us, it is a chance to become attached to this not only from a technology perspective, but also to benefit from the marketing and branding exposure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''It's also a great conversation starter.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS — As Wernher von Braun [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C13FD3A5B167493CAA8178DD85F438785F9], the rocket scientist, used to say, the most overwhelming obstacle to exploring the cosmos isn’t gravity. It’s the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention the money.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Bas Lansdorp began dreaming more than a decade ago about establishing the first permanent human colony on Mars, his primary focus was not on overcoming the technological challenges. It was the business model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All the technology we need exists already — or nearly exists,” he said. “I just couldn’t figure out how to finance it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp, a 36-year-old Dutch engineer and entrepreneur, does not have the name recognition of Dennis Tito, the American financier and space tourist, who announced a plan last month to send two people on a round-trip Mars flyby in 2018. Nor can Mr. Lansdorp hope to match the deep pockets of Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and <span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span>, who has proposed sending as many as 80,000 people to the Red Planet and charging them $500,000 each. Richard Branson, the Virgin entrepreneur, has space aspirations, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lansdorp is convinced that he has found the perfect plan to raise the $6 billion he says he needs to land an initial crew of four people on the Martian surface by 2023. The entire mission — from the astronauts’ selection and training to their arrival and construction of a permanent settlement — would be broadcast as a worldwide, multiyear reality television show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How many people do you think would want to watch the first humans arrive on Mars?” Mr. Lansdorp asked in a recent interview, recalling the more than 600 million viewers who were said to have tuned in to the grainy, black-and-white images of Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This will be one of the biggest events in human history,” he said. “We are talking about creating a major media spectacle, much bigger than the moon landings or the Olympics, and with huge potential for revenues coming from TV rights and sponsorships.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the record, Mr. Lansdorp will be executive producer, not an actor, in this extravaganza: He does not plan to make the trip himself. And despite the significant skepticism his plan has raised in some quarters, he cites his success in starting and cashing out of the wind-energy company Ampyx Power  [http://www.ampyxpower.com/] — a company trying to use pilotless, tethered aircraft to generate electricity — as evidence that he can turn lofty ideas into financially viable realities. Mr. Lansdorp declined to say how much he had made selling his stake in Ampyx, a privately held company, other than indicating it had been enough that he would not have to work for at least several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With just 10 years to select and prepare its first crew, the project, called Mars One, expects to begin recruiting prospective astronauts online this spring. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, be physically fit and speak English, and they must be willing to live out the final selection process and an eight-year training program — not to mention the Mars mission itself — under the constant stare of a television camera. No specific technical skills or experience are required, but be sure to read the fine print: For reasons of cost and logistics, this is a one-way trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Reality meets talent show, with no ending and the whole world watching,” is how Paul Romer, a Dutch television executive and the co-creator of the original “Big Brother” series, describes it in an endorsement on the Mars One Web site [http://mars-one.com/en/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Mars One is raising more eyebrows than cash. Until this year, the project was financed almost entirely by Mr. Lansdorp himself. Last month, Mars One secured its first commitments from outside investors, and those funds will be used to finance the first conceptual design studies for the various hardware components, including the spacecraft and lander, life support systems, supply vehicles and communications systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site has received about 1.7 million unique visitors since it went live last June, according to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Analytics. But more than 8,000 people, from more than 100 countries, have already e-mailed résumés since online recruiting began in January. Dr. Norbert Kraft, a specialist in aerospace medicine and a former researcher at NASA, as well as the space agencies of Japan and Russia, leads a team of experts who will vet applicants for their basic suitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a big trip,” Dr. Kraft said. “They will have to be really ready for that physically and psychologically.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool will be narrowed to a few hundred candidates by 2014, at which point Mars One hopes to begin televising the process in select countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick du Plooy, a medical student applying from Pretoria, South Africa, confessed that he was not a huge fan of standard-fare reality TV and hoped Mars One would be “held to a higher quality standard.” Mr. Plooy, 22, said he imagined the grueling routine of his coming medical internship and residency years would help him prepare for the rigors of life as an astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp has set up Mars One as a nonprofit foundation, but it is the controlling shareholder in a for-profit company, Interplanetary Media Group, that owns the exclusive right to sell mission broadcast and advertising rights. Just how much those rights might be worth is anyone’s guess — but Mars One is betting that it is a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp cites a report published last year by the <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> that said the winter and summer Games — three-week events, staged every two years — had generated about $5 billion in revenue from 2009 to 2012, of which more than $3.9 billion had come from the sale of broadcast rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more direct comparison, reality TV, has generated significant revenue for broadcasters for years. Although past its peak, the British version of “Big Brother” generated in 2006 as much as a fourth of the annual advertising revenue for the country’s publicly owned Channel 4 network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Viacom</span>, the American media company, attributed much of the double-digit growth in its cable television ad sales in recent years to the success of “Jersey Shore,” which ended a six-year run on MTV television in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not everyone is convinced that Snooki in Space would fly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The idea of flying to Mars one-way is not as outlandish as it may appear,” said Robert Zubrin, former chairman of the United States National Space Society and a longtime advocate of a privately financed human mission to Mars. And he argues that it could be done with a budget “in the single-digit billions” of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But I am very skeptical that it can be financed by broadcast revenues,” he said. “The initial mission could get great deal of attention. But how long could you sustain interest in a Martian ‘Little House on the Prairie’ at the level of revenues that would be required?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp winces a little at the reality-show label. “It’s a very difficult tradeoff between the goals of the project and to finance this mission,” he conceded. “This is not ‘Big Brother Goes to Mars.’ It’s important this is treated as a very serious project.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is for that reason, he said, that Mars One is focusing first on gaining credibility with prospective investors, sponsors and aerospace suppliers. Mr. Lansdorp declined to say how much he had budgeted for the initial publicity campaign, but experts like Mr. Zubrin estimate that it might take $30 million to $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Meijer, chief operating officer of the Dutch unit of <span class="companylink">Trifork</span>, a software developer based in Copenhagen, said his company — which is also supplying Web-host and network technology for Mars One — agreed to invest an undisclosed sum with the goal of raising its own profile through association with the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are not many of these kind of projects around,” Mr. Meijer said. “For us, it is a chance to become attached to this not only from a technology perspective, but also to benefit from the marketing and branding exposure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “It’s also a great conversation starter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, discussions are under way with prospective suppliers. Mars One says it held initial talks with about a half-dozen companies, including big industry players like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, for its heavy rocket launchers, and Thales of France, for its pressurized cargo vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week, Mr. Lansdorp said, he will announce Mars One’s first supplier contract, with a U.S. aerospace company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lansdorp is more pragmatic than wistful about why he does not plan himself to migrate to Mars.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEIRD LIFE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Search for Life That Is Very, Very Different From Our Own</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By David Toomey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">268 pp. <span class="companylink">W. W. Norton &amp; Company</span>. $25.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's life, Jim, but not as we know it. The familiar phrase, apocryphally attributed to ''Star Trek,'' encapsulates David Toomey's study of the search for species flourishing in places where life was thought to be insupportable. ''Weird Life'' is a breakneck tour through natural history, encounters of an impossible kind, researchers as weird as the organisms they pursue that leads the reader to wonder where science ends and fantasy begins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story begins very much down to earth. The discovery of a hidden microbial world within our own planet's ecosystems is not many decades old. Life, of a very odd sort, is much more ubiquitous than was once thought. Some micro-organisms thrive in boiling water under pressure; others feed on sulfur, salt, deadly poisonous elements, even radioactivity. Toomey describes one fungus found in the ''water core of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, ingeniously and fearlessly converting nuclear radiation into usable energy and managing radiation damage by keeping copies of the same chromosome in every cell.'' ''Extremophiles'' can be found living in ice, under the sea floor, multiplying in clouds or huddled implausibly deep beneath the ground in a newly discovered geological biosphere. These tiny cells -- a pinhead would be a world to them -- do not look particularly spectacular. Most of them are just minute rods that grow by fission. But they are chemical factories of extraordinary versatility. As one distinguished microbiologist has put it, if they can find a way of grabbing an electron, they evolve to do so. Nobody knows how many species of extremophiles there are, and many more wait to be discovered, which should be exciting enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is already known is even more remarkable: for all their mysteriousness these tiny strangers share an ancestor with all us everyday weeds, butterflies and mammals. The extremophiles represent alternative, carbon-based life paths that diverged from the rest of existence more than three billion years ago. Some biologists believe that these microbes resemble our common ancestor, because they were adapted to an early Earth very different from the gentle Gaia we have today. They lurk in inhospitable corners and are tough enough to survive space travel, which leads to thoughts of life on Earth being seeded from elsewhere. Perhaps extremophiles are more than just strange anomalies. Toomey's journey is about to leave Earth and head for the planets and the stars beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars is the first stop. The thought that life might have been introduced from the red planet is far from new. Bill Clinton endorsed the possibility of life on Mars in 1996, but this claim has since been called into question. Nonetheless, there are probably places where extreme extremophiles from Earth could still prosper near its icy poles. But the search must move on, and here the science starts to merge with science fiction. It is certainly possible that the space probe Kepler has now detected numerous Earthlike planets circulating other stars in the galaxy, and some of them must be just the right distance from their own suns to be suitable for life. Lou Allamandola, the founder and director of the Astrophysics and Astrochemistry Laboratory at NASA's Ames Research Center, is replicating in the laboratory the conditions on comet's tails, showing how complex organic compounds might be synthesized there. But then. . . .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are used to thinking of life based upon the distinctive properties of carbon and water. It does not have to be like that, according to astrobiologists. Life probably requires solvents, and a way for complex molecules to be built up: a prerequisite for self-replication that is one of life's essential features. However, out on Titan (a moon of Saturn) there is liquid methane in which life could arise and whole new biochemical pathways could be imagined. A National Research Council report concludes: ''If life is an intrinsic property of chemical reactivity, life should exist on Titan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why stop there? On Triton (a moon of Neptune), where temperatures are so low that gases liquefy, a metabolism based on strange silica compounds and liquid nitrogen has been posited. Or again, astrobiologists have proposed life in the clouds surrounding Venus, and based on sulfuric acid. Why not life around red dwarfs if one tweaks the elements in a different fashion? Or in the multiverses that allegedly exist alongside our own universe, but through an impenetrable curtain? Or near absolute zero? Life -- or at least theoretical life -- seems to be possible almost everywhere and at all times by Toomey's account. Even on the edges of black holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a real problem with these speculations if they are to be regarded as scientific hypotheses, and Toomey gives them far too easy a ride. He does know about Karl Popper's distinction between science and metaphysics, because it appears in a footnote in his book: science, Popper holds, is testable and falsifiable. Virtually all the fun speculations of the astrobiologists would fail these stringent but necessary criteria. Provided the chemistry and physics are plausible, just about any bio-creation is presented as scientifically justified. The trouble is that they are not yet capable of being falsified, or indeed testable by experiment. It must be a tremendously enjoyable intellectual exercise paddling around in the seas of faraway worlds imagining life as a mist, or life that takes three millenniums to form a thought, or life based on liquid nitrogen. But it is not science. It is playful imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leads to the interesting notion that the only difference between science and science fiction in astrobiology is who says what. If the creature from outer space comes from the pen of Ursula K. Le Guin, it is science fiction, whereas if it is Carl Sagan (he of the Jovian ''floaters''), it must be science. Where predictions have been made of weird life in an earthly system -- like claims of arsenical life in Lake Mono -- they have quickly been brought to account and sent packing. Provably wrong ideas in science get banished to an amnesiac world. A playful imagination might suggest that they are free to interbreed there and generate new life-forms. Science, Jim, but not as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which brings us to money. Science proceeds by fashion as much as by necessity, and astrobiology is fashionable, which is doubtless why Toomey followed it as a topic. Meanwhile, on planet Earth it's estimated that 86 percent of all species -- weird or not -- have not been ­discovered, described or named. As the naturalists who might do so are themselves becoming rarer and rarer, it is hard not to regret the funds flying to the untestable reaches of space, when so much remains to be discovered among real, living, ­carbon-based organisms here on boring old Earth.</p>
<p>Richard Fortey's latest book is ''Horseshoe Crabs and Velvet Worms: The Story of the Animals and Plants That Time Has Left Behind.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twice on a recent Friday, the cosmos intruded rudely on us earthlings. A meteor exploded over western Siberia, shattering windows, injuring hundreds and scaring pretty much everyone else. That same day, an asteroid passed within 18,000 miles of us, close enough to arch many an eyebrow among astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One earthling, at least, looked on the bright side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It allows me, when I talk about asteroids, to reference an actual event where people got hurt,” said Neil deGrasse Tyson[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/neil_degrasse_tyson/index.html?inline=nyt-per], an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/index.php] in Manhattan for going on two decades. Not that Dr. Tyson was glad that people had been injured. Far from it. All the same, he said over drinks in Lower Manhattan, this cosmic activity “gives punctuation to my sentence that the human race is at risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Think of it,” he said, “as a shot across our bow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warning that the planet could be imperiled has a way of focusing the mind wondrously. So we asked about a huge asteroid called Apophis, whose name alone ought to give one pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s from the Egyptian god of death and destruction,” Dr. Tyson said. “It was named knowing that it crosses Earth’s orbit.” Otherwise, he said, “we would have named it something less threatening, like Tiffany or Bambi.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say it will fly uncomfortably close to us in 2029 and again in 2036 and yet again in 2068. Luck, Dr. Tyson is convinced, will not be forever on our side. “What is a certainty is that one day Apophis and Earth will collide,” he said. “So our goal should be, if the survival of our civilization is a concern and a priority, to find a way to deflect it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We know how to do it,” he said, but he added this disheartened postscript: “There’s no funded plan to do so anywhere in the world.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of planetary cataclysm was not on our agenda when we invited Dr. Tyson to break bread. The original question was simpler: Could the latest brushes with asteroids get people thinking about the universe more, well, cosmically?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because his schedule is forever tight, a proposed meal turned into late-afternoon drinks at the Beekman Pub, around the corner from City Hall and a short walk from his home. (Memo to accounting: you will be happy to hear that all he had to drink was a Diet Pepsi, with lime. His tablemate splurged on a beer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson — Bronx-reared and, as he likes to point out, born in the same week in 1958 as NASA[http://www.nasa.gov/] — is given to speaking not in whole sentences but, rather, in whole paragraphs. He has a gift for putting the fizz in physics and taking the sigh out of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chances are he is no stranger to you. He is a television semiregular. Dr. Tyson even turned up, in illustrated form, in the January issue of Action Comics, identifying a plausible location in the real cosmos for Krypton, which had been Superman’s home planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He theorized that Krypton could have orbited a red dwarf star in the Corvus constellation, 27 light years from Earth. That’s roughly 160 trillion miles away, in case you are thinking of a trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole thing, he said, was DC Comics’ idea: “As a lifelong resident of Metropolis, the least I could do is allow my likeness to be in conversation with Superman.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Dr. Tyson is less focused on the planetarium than on creating a new iteration of “Cosmos,” the hit PBS series featuring Carl Sagan, which was first broadcast in 1980. This sequel, for the Fox network, is planned for early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of its producers is Seth MacFarlane. Yup, that Seth MacFarlane, the “Family Guy” guy and (to some viewers) the cringe-inducing host of this year’s Academy Awards show. Whatever one may think of his brand of comedy, “Seth MacFarlane is deeply committed to science literacy in this country,” Dr. Tyson said, and the two of them share a goal: reinforcing the idea that “science needs to be taken to people’s hearts in a way that they become better citizens for it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is he saying that we treat science and mathematics shabbily in this country, where many people are all too proud to admit to a fear of all sums? Actually, Dr. Tyson said, “I don’t think the country’s less literate in math and science than ever before.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I cite, for example, how familiar people are with images from the Hubble telescope[http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/],” he said. “The Hubble did not require a P.R. person to become famous. It did all the P.R. on its own.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop culture, too, is part of “a positive trend line,” given science-themed blockbuster films like “Avatar” and the durable “Star Wars” series, and popular television programs like the “C.S.I.” and “NCIS” franchises and “The Big Bang Theory.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There was a day when we didn’t have science at all in television programming,” Dr. Tyson said between sips of his soda. “Now it’s there, without having to stereotype the lab-coated, wire-haired character.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s the real problem, as he sees it: “You have people who are not scientifically literate who have risen to positions of power and control,” whether on local school boards or in Congress. He mentioned Representative Paul C. Broun[http://broun.house.gov/], a Georgia Republican (and doctor) who sits on the House Science Committee[http://science.house.gov/] and who says the world is 9,000 years old and was literally created in six days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters, Dr. Tyson said, need to grasp the consequences of their electoral choices, especially if they produce officials who “undermine the source of creativity for tomorrow’s economy.” Meddle with the citizenry’s understanding of science and technology, he said, and people “will emerge on the other side incapable of making the discoveries and innovations that the nation requires in order to stay economically competitive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the Creation, “if you use the Bible as your science textbook, you will go astray — there’s no question about it,” he said, adding: “Galileo understood this. He can be credited with drawing a line in the sand with his famous quote that the Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all due respect to Galileo, he does not top Dr. Tyson’s list of science greats. “The first person I would meet the day a time machine gets invented” is Isaac Newton, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this afternoon, Dr. Tyson wore a pale yellow tie emblazoned with Newton’s image. It instantly caught the eye, as did a red rose tucked into the breast pocket of his jacket, a souvenir from a luncheon that day. The rose was in itself both a science lesson and a reminder of the planet’s fragility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Flowers capture some of why we value life,” he said. “If a flower were permanent, it would be so much less meaningful to the person you gave it to. It’s the fact that you know it will die in a matter of days that you care for it and you appreciate its beauty all the more.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One earthling, at least, looked on the bright side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It allows me, when I talk about asteroids, to reference an actual event where people got hurt,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan for going on two decades. Not that Dr. Tyson was glad that people had been injured. Far from it. All the same, he said over drinks in Lower Manhattan, this cosmic activity ''gives punctuation to my sentence that the human race is at risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Think of it,'' he said, ''as a shot across our bow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warning that the planet could be imperiled has a way of focusing the mind wondrously. So we asked about a huge asteroid called Apophis, whose name alone ought to give one pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's from the Egyptian god of death and destruction,'' Dr. Tyson said. ''It was named knowing that it crosses Earth's orbit.'' Otherwise, he said, ''we would have named it something less threatening, like Tiffany or Bambi.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists say it will fly uncomfortably close to us in 2029 and again in 2036 and yet again in 2068. Luck, Dr. Tyson is convinced, will not be forever on our side. ''What is a certainty is that one day Apophis and Earth will collide,'' he said. ''So our goal should be, if the survival of our civilization is a concern and a priority, to find a way to deflect it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know how to do it,'' he said, but he added this disheartened postscript: ''There's no funded plan to do so anywhere in the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility of planetary cataclysm was not on our agenda when we invited Dr. Tyson to break bread. The original question was simpler: Could the latest brushes with asteroids get people thinking about the universe more, well, cosmically?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because his schedule is forever tight, a proposed meal turned into late-afternoon drinks at the Beekman Pub, around the corner from City Hall and a short walk from his home. (Memo to accounting: you will be happy to hear that all he had to drink was a Diet Pepsi, with lime. His tablemate splurged on a beer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tyson -- Bronx-reared and, as he likes to point out, born in the same week in 1958 as NASA -- is given to speaking not in whole sentences but, rather, in whole paragraphs. He has a gift for putting the fizz in physics and taking the sigh out of science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chances are he is no stranger to you. He is a television semiregular. Dr. Tyson even turned up, in illustrated form, in the January issue of Action Comics, identifying a plausible location in the real cosmos for Krypton, which had been Superman's home planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He theorized that Krypton could have orbited a red dwarf star in the Corvus constellation, 27 light years from Earth. That's roughly 160 trillion miles away, in case you are thinking of a trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole thing, he said, was DC Comics' idea: ''As a lifelong resident of Metropolis, the least I could do is allow my likeness to be in conversation with Superman.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Dr. Tyson is less focused on the planetarium than on creating a new iteration of ''Cosmos,'' the hit PBS series featuring Carl Sagan, which was first broadcast in 1980. This sequel, for the Fox network, is planned for early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of its producers is Seth MacFarlane. Yup, that Seth MacFarlane, the ''Family Guy'' guy and (to some viewers) the cringe-inducing host of this year's Academy Awards show. Whatever one may think of his brand of comedy, ''Seth MacFarlane is deeply committed to science literacy in this country,'' Dr. Tyson said, and the two of them share a goal: reinforcing the idea that ''science needs to be taken to people's hearts in a way that they become better citizens for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is he saying that we treat science and mathematics shabbily in this country, where many people are all too proud to admit to a fear of all sums? Actually, Dr. Tyson said, ''I don't think the country's less literate in math and science than ever before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I cite, for example, how familiar people are with images from the Hubble telescope,'' he said. ''The Hubble did not require a P.R. person to become famous. It did all the P.R. on its own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop culture, too, is part of ''a positive trend line,'' given science-themed blockbuster films like ''Avatar'' and the durable ''Star Wars'' series, and popular television programs like the ''C.S.I.'' and ''NCIS'' franchises and ''The Big Bang Theory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a day when we didn't have science at all in television programming,'' Dr. Tyson said between sips of his soda. ''Now it's there, without having to stereotype the lab-coated, wire-haired character.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the real problem, as he sees it: ''You have people who are not scientifically literate who have risen to positions of power and control,'' whether on local school boards or in Congress. He mentioned Representative Paul C. Broun, a Georgia Republican (and doctor) who sits on the House Science Committee and who says the world is 9,000 years old and was literally created in six days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters, Dr. Tyson said, need to grasp the consequences of their electoral choices, especially if they produce officials who ''undermine the source of creativity for tomorrow's economy.'' Meddle with the citizenry's understanding of science and technology, he said, and people ''will emerge on the other side incapable of making the discoveries and innovations that the nation requires in order to stay economically competitive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the Creation, ''if you use the Bible as your science textbook, you will go astray -- there's no question about it,'' he said, adding: ''Galileo understood this. He can be credited with drawing a line in the sand with his famous quote that the Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With all due respect to Galileo, he does not top Dr. Tyson's list of science greats. ''The first person I would meet the day a time machine gets invented'' is Isaac Newton, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On this afternoon, Dr. Tyson wore a pale yellow tie emblazoned with Newton's image. It instantly caught the eye, as did a red rose tucked into the breast pocket of his jacket, a souvenir from a luncheon that day. The rose was in itself both a science lesson and a reminder of the planet's fragility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flowers capture some of why we value life,'' he said. ''If a flower were permanent, it would be so much less meaningful to the person you gave it to. It's the fact that you know it will die in a matter of days that you care for it and you appreciate its beauty all the more.''</p>
<p>''You have people who are not scientifically literate who have risen to positions of power and control,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium. (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHANG W. LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES)   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several billion years ago, Mars may well have been a pleasant place for tiny microbes to live, with plenty of water as well as minerals that could have served as food, NASA scientists said Tuesday at a news conference on the latest findings from their Mars rover. But they have yet to find signs that actual microbes did live in that oasis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life that probably if this water was around and you had been on the planet, you would have been able to drink it,'' said John P. Grotzinger, the California Institute of Technology geology professor who is the principal investigator for the NASA mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In drilling into its first rock, a fine-grained mudstone, the scientists said, the rover Curiosity -- a self-contained science laboratory about the size of a Mini Cooper -- sent back to Earth convincing evidence that Mars was once awash in water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, the Curiosity scientists identified elements in the rocks -- sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon -- that are some of the key ingredients of life, as well as minerals, like sulfates and sulfides, that primitive microbes could eat for food. Dr. Grotzinger said these minerals are ''effectively like batteries'' and can provide an energy source for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This included the presence of clays, one of the main things that scientists were hoping that Curiosity would find on its two-year, $2.5 billion mission. Clays form in waters that have a neutral pH.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we have learned in the last 20 years of modern microbiology is that very primitive organisms, they can derive energy just by feeding on rocks,'' Dr. Grotzinger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the Curiosity scientists said they had not yet definitively found the carbon building blocks needed to come together to give rise to living organisms. Two earlier NASA rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, also found strong evidence of liquid water on the Martian surface, but in places on the planet that were highly acidic and salty -- far harsher for any hypothetical organisms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About three billion years ago, the conditions on Mars changed. With just one-tenth the mass of Earth, Mars was unable to hold on to most of its atmosphere. The inside of the planet cooled, and the volcanoes stopped erupting. The water froze or evaporated and escaped into space. Mars became cold and dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity landed in August in a 96-mile crater named Gale, gouged long ago by a meteor, and has been roaming in the area since then. The rover's ultimate destination is a three-mile-high mountain at the center of the crater that caught the eye of scientists because they detected the presence of clays in observations taken by orbiting spacecraft. Now, long before getting to the mountain, scientists have already found the clays, and these rocks would be prime candidates to look for organics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists and engineers have been taking a deliberate, careful approach to checking the rover's systems. The last instrument to be tested was the drill, which ground up its first rock a month ago. A bit of the powder was then scooped up and dropped in a sophisticated chemistry laboratory for analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surface of Mars today is cold, dry and battered by radiation from space. But planetary scientists think young Mars, more than three billion years ago, was a far more hospitable place, with a thicker atmosphere, warmer weather and water flowing at the surface. Some scientists believe that if life ever took hold there, it might persist even today beneath the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curiosity is not carrying any instruments that can detect Martian life, past or present, but it can identify so-called organic molecules, which contain carbon and hydrogen atoms. The presence of organic molecules would not prove the presence of life, since many nonliving chemical reactions can produce organic molecules. But organic molecules are a necessary prerequisite for life -- at least, life as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the Curiosity scientists cannot say that the rock contained organics, but neither can they rule out the possibility. Rather, since their instruments did measure some simple organics, the researchers are sorting out whether the organics came from the Martian rock, from contamination brought from Earth or were formed in chemical reactions as the rock powder was heated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the scientists are excited by the possibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have an image now of possibly a lake, a fresh water lake, on Mars with a thicker atmosphere,'' said John M. Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answers will take a while to discern. Science operations are delayed as engineers work to diagnose and fix what went wrong with the rover's computer last week when Curiosity failed to send back science data and then failed to go to sleep as scheduled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the rover's computer memory had become corrupted, and the engineers switched operations to an identical backup. They are also figuring out whether the corrupted memory may clear up when the computer is restarted or whether the errors are permanent, requiring modification of computer programs to avoid that part of the memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Sun will be in the way between Mars and Earth for most of April, making communications impossible. Limited science work is expected to resume in a few days, but further drilling of rocks will wait until May.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] official said Tuesday that engineers had resolved the latest problem with the Curiosity rover on Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and that the laboratory-on-wheels should resume science operations this week after a three-week delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re back on track now,” said Richard Cook, the project manager for Curiosity at the space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making a case for the need to detect asteroids before they hit Earth, a former astronaut said Wednesday that the number of casualties would have been enormous had the space rock that exploded in Russia last month blown apart directly over New York City instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd have a lot more than broken windows, that's for sure,'' the former astronaut, Edward Lu, told a Senate panel in Washington. Dr. Lu, also a former executive at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, is now the chief executive of the B612 Foundation, a Silicon Valley group that wants to build a privately financed asteroid-detecting space telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,500 people were injured when the roughly 60-foot-diameter meteor exploded high in the atmosphere near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Feb. 15. Most of the injuries were caused by flying glass from shattered windows when a shock wave from the explosion -- estimated to have been about 30 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima -- hit the city a minute and a half later. ''Had that shock wave been a lot closer to a city, it would have caused a lot more damage,'' Dr. Lu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted that if the so-called Tunguska event -- the explosion of a roughly 150-foot asteroid over Siberia in 1908 -- had occurred over New York, ''whatever the population of New York City is, they'd be gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelyabinsk meteor was not detected by any of the ground-based telescopes, operated by NASA and others, that are surveying the sky for space rocks that are in orbits that could intersect with Earth's. Those search programs are focused on larger asteroids, James Green, director of the planetary science division of NASA, told the Senate panel, the Science and Space Subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far about 10,000 have been detected, including about 95 percent of the estimated 1,100 that are a kilometer (about 1,000 yards) or more in diameter and have the potential to end civilization. So far, Dr. Green said, no asteroid has been found that poses a threat to the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Lu noted that for every asteroid that had been detected, there were probably 100 more that had not been seen, including hundreds of thousands that are the size of the Russian meteor. ''Right now, the amount of warning time that we are likely to get from one of these asteroids is zero,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a meteor was found to be just days from hitting Earth, there is little that could be done, except perhaps evacuating a city or region. But in response to a question from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, Dr. Lu said that given enough lead time, there were various ways to divert an asteroid to make it miss Earth entirely, including something as basic as running into it with a spacecraft to nudge it just a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you find it early, we have many options,'' Dr. Lu said. ''Then you only need to change its trajectory by a very tiny amount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The key is, if you don't know where they are, there's nothing you can do,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some people argue that money would be better spent on more pressing societal problems than on a low-probability event like a civilization-busting asteroid strike, both Mr. Cruz and Senator Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the panel, expressed little skepticism about the scientists' testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm eager for our collective journey to ensure that NASA and all related programs have sufficient resources and sufficient priorities to do what needs to be done,'' said Mr. Cruz, who was elected last year with Tea Party backing, in his opening remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked after the hearing about the senator's position on the NASA budget, only a small portion of which goes toward asteroid detection, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz said she had no comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One difficulty in searching for asteroids from the ground is that the sun often gets in the way, making a small space rock impossible to see. The B612 telescope, called Sentinel, would be oriented in a way that could eliminate that problem. The project is estimated to cost $450 million, and the foundation has a goal of launching the telescope within five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While NASA is not providing any money for the Sentinel project, Dr. Green said the agency was offering some technical help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a later interview, Dr. Lu said that while his group was busy raising money privately and was not seeking money from NASA, ''if they decide that this is something that is of value to them, and they want to have that conversation, then I'd be happy to have that conversation.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For about three hours on Wednesday, Voyager 1 had left the solar system -- before a rewritten news release headline pulled it back in. Voyager 1, one of two spacecraft NASA launched in 1977 on a grand tour of the outer planets, is now nearly 11.5 billion miles from the Sun, speeding away at 38,000 miles per hour. In a paper accepted by the journal Geophysical Review Letters, William R. Webber of New Mexico State University and Frank B. McDonald of the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> reported that on Aug. 25 last year, the spacecraft observed a sudden change in the mix of cosmic rays hitting it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmic rays are high-speed charged particles, mostly protons. Voyager 1's instruments recorded nearly a doubling of cosmic rays from outside the solar system, while the intensity of cosmic rays that had been trapped in the outer solar system dropped by 90 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Geophysical Union, publisher of the journal, sent out the news Wednesday morning: ''Voyager 1 has left the solar system.'' NASA officials, surprised, countered with a contrary statement from Edward C. Stone, the Voyager project scientist. ''It is the consensus of the Voyager science team that Voyager 1 has not yet left the solar system or reached interstellar space,'' Dr. Stone said. He said that the critical indicator would be a change in the direction of the magnetic field, not cosmic rays, for marking the outermost boundary of the solar system. In their paper, Dr. Webber and Dr. McDonald (who died only six days after Voyager observed the shift in cosmic rays) did not claim that Voyager 1 was in interstellar space, but had entered a part of the solar system they called the ''heliocliff.'' The geophysical union then sent out another e-mail with the same article but a milder headline: ''Voyager 1 has entered a new region of space.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making a case for the need to detect asteroids before they hit Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a former astronaut said Wednesday that the number of casualties would have been enormous had the space rock that exploded in Russia last month blown apart directly over New York City instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’d have a lot more than broken windows, that’s for sure,” the former astronaut, Edward Lu, told a Senate panel in Washington. Dr. Lu, also a former executive at <span class="companylink">Google</span>, is now the chief executive of the B612 Foundation[http://b612foundation.org/about-us/team/b612-leadership/], a Silicon Valley group that wants to build a privately financed asteroid-detecting space telescope[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/science/space/dismissed-as-doomsayers-advocates-for-meteor-detection-feel-vindicated.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,500 people were injured when the roughly 60-foot-diameter meteor[http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fireball_130301.html] exploded high in the atmosphere near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Feb. 15. Most of the injuries were caused by flying glass from shattered windows when a shock wave from the explosion — estimated to have been about 30 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima — hit the city a minute and a half later. “Had that shock wave been a lot closer to a city, it would have caused a lot more damage,” Dr. Lu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also noted that if the so-called Tunguska event — the explosion of a roughly 150-foot asteroid over Siberia in 1908 — had occurred over New York, “whatever the population of New York City is, they’d be gone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelyabinsk meteor was not detected by any of the ground-based telescopes, operated by NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and others, that are surveying the sky for space rocks that are in orbits that could intersect with Earth’s.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers released the latest and most exquisite baby picture yet of the universe on Thursday, one that showed it to be 80 million to 100 million years older and a little fatter than previously thought, with more matter in it and perhaps ever so slightly lopsided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recorded by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>'s Planck satellite, the image is a heat map of the cosmos as it appeared only 370,000 years after the Big Bang, showing space speckled with faint spots from which galaxies would grow over billions of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The map, the Planck team said in news conferences and in 29 papers posted online Thursday, is in stunning agreement with the general view of the universe that has emerged over the past 20 years, of a cosmos dominated by mysterious dark energy that seems to be pushing space apart and the almost-as-mysterious dark matter that is pulling galaxies together. It also shows a universe that seems to have endured an explosive burp known as inflation, which was the dynamite in the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement issued by the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span>, Jean-Jacques Dordain, its director general, said, ''The extraordinary quality of Planck's portrait of the infant universe allows us to peel back its layers to the very foundations, revealing that our blueprint of the cosmos is far from complete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the standard cosmological framework, however, the new satellite data underscored the existence of puzzling anomalies that may yet lead theorists back to the drawing board. The universe appears to be slightly lumpier, with bigger and more hot and cold spots in the northern half of the sky as seen from Earth than toward the south, for example. And there is a large, unexplained cool spot in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those anomalies had shown up on previous maps by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, or WMAP, satellite, but some had argued that they were because of a bad analysis or contamination from the Milky Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now cosmologists will have to take them more seriously, said Max Tegmark, an expert on the early universe at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not part of the Planck team. He described the new results as ''very exciting.'' It could be, he said, that ''the universe is trying to tell us something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Efstathiou, of Cambridge University, one of the leaders of the Planck project, said in the <span class="companylink">European Space Agency</span> news release: ''Our ultimate goal would be to construct a new model that predicts the anomalies and links them together. But these are early days; so far, we don't know whether this is possible and what type of new physics might be needed. And that's exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Planck satellite was launched in 2009 and has been scanning the sky ever since, recording the faint variations in a haze of radio microwaves that fill the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation used in the kitchen for heating leftovers; that they are important for cosmology was discovered by accident back in 1965 by a pair of Bell Labs radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilson, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Using balloons, a U-2 spy plane and a series of satellites like the WMAP, astronomers have been teasing out the detailed features of this radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The microwaves detected by the Planck date from 370,000 years after the Big Bang, which is as far back as optical or radio telescopes will ever be able to see, cosmologists say. But the patterns within them date from less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe is said to have undergone a violent burst of expansion known as inflation that set cosmic history on the course it has followed ever since. Those patterns are Planck's prize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analyzing the relative sizes and frequencies of spots and ripples over the years has allowed astronomers to describe the birth of the universe to a precision that would make the philosophers weep. The new data have allowed astronomers to tweak their model a bit. It now seems the universe is 13.8 billion years old, instead of 13.7 billion, and consists by mass of 4.9 percent ordinary matter like atoms, 27 percent dark matter and 68 percent dark energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Kamionkowski, an astrophysicist at <span class="companylink">Johns Hopkins University</span> who commented on the work at a news teleconference sponsored by NASA, called Planck ''cosmology's human genome project,'' saying, ''It shows the seeds from which the current universe grew.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David N. Spergel, a <span class="companylink">Princeton University</span> cosmologist, described the new results as ''beautiful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The standard cosmological model looks even stronger today than yesterday,'' he said. ''The universe remains simple and strange.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest surprise here, astronomers said, is that the universe is expanding slightly more slowly than previous measurements had indicated. The Hubble constant, which characterizes the expansion rate, is 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec -- in the units astronomers use -- according to Planck. Recent ground-based measurements combined with the WMAP data gave a value of 69, offering enough of a discrepancy to make cosmologists rerun their computer simulations of cosmic history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that astronomers once would go to war over a factor of two in measurements of this parameter shows how cosmology has progressed over the past 20 years. Pressed for a possible explanation for the discrepancy, Martin White, a Planck team member from the University of California, Berkeley, said it represents a mismatch between measurements made of the beginning of time and those made more recently, and that it could mean that dark energy, which is speeding up the expansion of the universe, is more complicated than cosmologists thought. He termed the possibility ''pretty radical,'' adding, ''That would be pretty exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data also offered striking support for the notion of inflation, which has been the backbone of Big Bang theorizing for 30 years. Under the influence of a mysterious force field during the first trillionth of a fraction of a second, what would become the observable universe ballooned by 100 trillion trillion times in size from a subatomic pinprick to a grapefruit in less than a violent eye-blink, so the story first enunciated by Alan Guth of M.I.T. goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Submicroscopic quantum fluctuations in this force field are what would produce the hot spots in the cosmic microwaves, which in turn would grow into galaxies. According to Planck's measurements, those fluctuations so far fit the predictions of the simplest model of inflation, invented by Andrei Linde of Stanford, to a T.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tegmark of M.I.T. said, ''We're homing in on the simplest model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmologists still do not know what might have caused inflation, but the recent discovery of the Higgs boson has provided evidence that the kinds of fields that can provoke such behavior really exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Tegmark and others said that another clue to the nature of inflation could come from the anomalies in the microwave data -- the lopsided bumpiness, for example -- that tend to happen on the largest scales in the universe. By the logic of quantum cosmology, they were the first patterns to be laid down on the emerging cosmos; that is to say, when inflation was just starting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He compared it to walking in on a fight. If the fight has been going on for a while, he said, it is impossible to tell who started it or who was hurt first. But if you come in only a few seconds after it started, you have a better chance of figuring out who did what to whom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may be,'' he said, ''we're coming in early to the cosmic brawl.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an eclectic mix of crowd-sourced video, information from <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth and data from nuclear test-ban sensors, scientists have gotten a much more accurate picture of the small asteroid that exploded[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/world/europe/meteorite-fragments-are-said-to-rain-down-on-siberia.html] near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is most clear is that while Chelyabinsk did not exactly dodge a bullet on Feb. 15, the city was fortunate to be only grazed by it. “The people of Chelyabinsk were very lucky,” Edward Lu, a former astronaut who now leads the B612 Foundation[http://b612foundation.org/], a private initiative to detect similar asteroids, said at a Congressional hearing last week about the space threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian meteor — which, according to the latest estimates, was about 60 feet in diameter and came in undetected at roughly 42,000 miles an hour — was almost 15 miles high when it blew apart. There were no deaths, and most of the 1,500 injuries were from glass as windows shattered when a shock wave hit the city 88 seconds later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If it had detonated closer to the ground, it would have been worse,” said Margaret Campbell-Brown, a member of a team of researchers at the University of Western Ontario[http://www.uwo.ca/] who have analyzed the meteor’s orbit and characteristics of the blast. It also helped that the meteor was a stony one — what scientists call an ordinary chondrite[http://www.meteoris.de/class/OC-Main.html] — and not a rarer iron-nickel one, in which case it might have reached the ground before exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blast was the largest fireball since the Tunguska event[http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-the-tunguska-explosion] of 1908, and as videos from surveillance, car-mounted and cellphone cameras[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/15/world/europe/16meteorite_videogrid.html?ref=space] quickly began to be posted online, it became apparent that this explosion would be studied like no other, with scientists and amateur bloggers alike rushing to analyze the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tunguska event involved the detonation of what is generally thought to be a meteor over a remote part of central Siberia. That object may have entered the atmosphere at a steeper angle than the Chelyabinsk meteor — which came in at an angle of less than 20 degrees from horizontal — and exploded about five miles above the ground. The lower altitude, as well as the larger size of the Tunguska rock, help explain why it had a much greater impact, flattening trees over an area the size of metropolitan Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Canadian team has calculated that the energy released in the Chelyabinsk explosion was the equivalent of about 440 kilotons of TNT, or about 30 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That calculation was made with the help of data from a network of acoustic sensors set up to monitor compliance with the treaty to ban nuclear weapons testing. There are about 45 of the sensors worldwide, detecting so-called infrasound at frequencies well below the range of human hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Mützelburg, a spokesman for the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization[http://ctbto.org/], which is based in Vienna, said the explosion was detected by more than 20 of the sensors, including one in Antarctica nearly 10,000 miles from Chelyabinsk. Low-frequency sounds do not dissipate easily, so some of the detectors picked up the explosion more than once as the sound circled the globe several times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With knowledge of the energy and information about how fast the meteor was traveling, researchers were then able to calculate the mass of the meteor, about 11,000 metric tons. “It’s all about the kinetic energy of that body,” which is related to its mass and velocity, said Richard P. Binzel, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor has a certain amount of energy as it enters the atmosphere, Dr. Binzel said. As it hits the air, it starts to decelerate quickly, and then the stress differential between the superpressurized air in front and the less-pressurized air behind causes the rock to break apart violently. “All that kinetic energy has to be released,” he said. Only small fragments of the meteor reached the ground, and some have been brought to laboratories in the United States, including the Institute for Rock Magnetism[http://www.irm.umn.edu/IRM/index.html] at the University of Minnesota, where a Russian scientist is studying their magnetic properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other teams, the Canadian researchers have used video images of the meteor’s east-to-west trail above Chelyabinsk to help calculate its trajectory and orbit. Since the explosion occurred in daylight, Dr. Campbell-Brown said they asked a colleague there to take night photographs from the same locations. By superimposing the images of the meteor’s path over the night images containing stars, the researchers should be able to plot the path even more accurately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, they and other teams, including one from the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia, have established that the meteor originated in the inner part of the asteroid belt, in a regular, harmless orbit around the Sun[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/sun/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] between Mars and Jupiter[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/jupiter_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. How it came to have an irregular Earth[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/earth_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]-crossing orbit is not known, but like other Earth crossers it was probably affected by the gravity of Jupiter or another planet at some point. It then circled the Sun every 18 months in a highly eccentric orbit — more than two and a half times the Earth-Sun distance at its farthest, close to the orbit of Venus at its nearest — before it smacked into the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Zuluaga, a member of the Colombian group, said he was inspired by work done soon after the event by Stefan Geens, a blogger[http://ogleearth.com/] in Stockholm. Mr. Geens used several videos — including one from a camera in Revolution Square in central Chelyabinsk — to triangulate the path. The video does not show the explosion directly, but rather the shadows of lampposts (and of a huge statue of Lenin), which moved like the shadow on a sundial as the fireball crossed the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, it is easy to pinpoint the coordinates of the Revolution Square camera and others. Dr. Zuluaga said that his team, which included Mr. Geens as a co-author on its most recent paper, is working to improve its calculations by, among other things, learning about the optics of the various video cameras. “We are trying to understand the distortion we have,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zuluaga thinks that eventually it will be possible to reconstruct the rock’s orbit so precisely that researchers may be able to detect it retroactively, by poring over images from sky-surveying telescopes taken the last time it flew near the Earth. “Then we can assign it a name,” he said. “It doesn’t have one now, because it’s a dead asteroid.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to helping scientists plot the meteor’s path, the videos that were posted online contributed to a surge in interest in projects to detect asteroids before they strike Earth. In an interview after his Congressional testimony, Dr. Lu said his foundation, which wants to put a privately financed telescope in space within five years, had seen an increase in donations since the explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It made it more real to folks,” he said. “There’s nothing like a hundred <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos to do that.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A DECADE AGO, the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span> paid $10 million to acquire the only known original copy of a 1507 world map that has been called “the birth certificate of America.” The large map, a masterpiece of woodblock printing, has been a star attraction at the library ever since and the object of revived scholarly fascination about the earliest cartography of the New World. The research has also rescued from obscurity a little-known Renaissance man, the 16th-century globe maker Johannes Schöner, who was responsible for saving the map for posterity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We call ourselves Americans today because of the map’s makers, Martin Waldseemüller and Mathias Ringmann, young clerics in the cathedral village of St.-Dié, France. By incorporating early New World discoveries, their map reached beyond the canonical descriptions of Old World geography handed down from Ptolemy in the second century. On a lower stretch of the southern continent, the mapmakers inscribed the name “America” in the mistaken belief that Amerigo Vespucci, not Columbus, deserved credit for first sighting a part of that continent, South America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or possibly they favored Vespucci because he held more firmly to the growing consensus that this was indeed a New World, not the Indies (as Columbus so wanted to believe), and because he wrote more colorfully than Columbus about the people he encountered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The map is also the source of an abiding mystery. How did Waldseemüller and Ringmann already know so well the configuration of South America, before any recorded Spanish or Portuguese voyages around the horn to the west coast? How did they know of the Pacific before Balboa made his sighting in 1513? Hard to believe it was just a guess or futuristic vision of what world geography would come to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Were the cartographers themselves dropping a hint when they wrote on the map that “if you are not familiar with the new discoveries, do not be afraid of what it is you see on this map, for it is how you will come to see your world in the future”?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, John W. Hessler, a historian of cartography at the library, published “The Naming of America,” an account of the map’s importance in post-Ptolemy geography, its disappearance for centuries and its rediscovery in a castle near the Black Forest in southwestern Germany. Now, Dr. Hessler has dug deeper into the dynamic of the years between Columbus, in 1492, and Copernicus, in 1543. Science and exploration were stretching minds to distant horizons, once unknown. Copernican astronomy was about to dislodge Earth from the center of the universe, a start to the Scientific Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His new book, “A Renaissance Globemaker’s Toolbox,” is not able to solve the mapmakers’ enduring mystery. But it is a richly illustrated delight to the eye. I advise a slow tour of the maps, drawings, marginal notes and other material remains of Schöner’s wide-ranging mind. Read the informative captions, then begin the text.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General readers will find the accounts of Schöner’s place in history and the preservation of the map lucid and fascinating. Parts of more technical chapters, like the instructions on making a terrestrial globe, appear to be written more for the author’s academic peers than for many laypeople. And of necessity, this is hardly a flesh-and-blood biography, as the archives are largely silent about Schöner’s personal life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We do see a print of a bearded, heavyset man and read a brief diary entry about him as a young Catholic cleric with a relaxed view of celibacy: he entered into a relationship with a woman that produced three children. One can thus understand his conversion to Protestantism in Martin Luther’s Reformation. That led him to the professorship in mathematics at Nuremberg, which he held to his death in 1547.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hessler leaned heavily on Schöner’s personal archive of correspondence and manuscripts, books and maps, including corrections and comments in the margins. He was into everything in science: completing two world globes in his prime, drawing celestial maps and globes and preparing horoscopes, one even for a Hapsburg emperor. Not another Leonardo da Vinci, but who was?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rather than a producer of theories,” Dr. Hessler observes, Schöner “was instead a disseminator, a compiler and a transmitter of the new science and mathematics.” Yes, something of a pack rat, but one with a sharp eye for what was likely to be of importance in the future. This attribute cast Schöner as savior of the 1507 world map. His practice was to gather and bind portfolios of his compiled materials. One of these, now called Schöner Sammelband (meaning “gathering”), preserved the “America” map. There it passed from hand to hand, all the other original prints disappeared, and Schöner’s was lost for more than 300 years. Most of the bound portfolios wound up in a Vienna library, but one languished in a German castle, unrecognized, until a Jesuit priest found it in 1901 — thence to the United States in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing in the book points up more clearly Schöner’s pivotal place in a world in transition from the medieval to the modern than his residual interest in astrology and his awakening curiosity when he apparently heard reports of a new theory being formulated by a Polish Catholic cleric. A brilliant young student of Schöner’s, Georg Joachim Rheticus, went to see Copernicus in 1539 and learned more about the Earth orbiting the Sun. Rheticus then composed a short treatise, written in the form of a letter to his teacher, “most illustrious and learned” Johannes Schöner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The publication, widely circulated in Europe, was the first definitive account of the new Copernican system of the heavens.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So few people do favors for NASA[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_aeronautics_and_space_administration/index.html?inline=nyt-org] these days. So when Jeff Bezos[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/jeffrey_p_bezos/index.html?inline=nyt-per], the <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> founder, announced last week[http://www.bezosexpeditions.com/updates.html] that an expedition he financed had hoisted two F-1 rocket engines from an Apollo mission off the ocean floor, the agency was understandably grateful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We look forward to the restoration of these engines by the Bezos team and applaud Jeff’s desire to make these historic artifacts available for public display,” the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., said in a statement[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/f1_engine.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engines may have been among the five that helped launch Neil Armstrong and his Apollo 11 shipmates to the Moon in 1969, while Mr. Bezos, then 5, watched on television. Today Mr. Bezos, one of a lineup of millionaires keen on space and underwater adventure, noted in a blog post[http://www.bezosexpeditions.com/learn-more.html] that the F-1 rocket engine is “still a modern wonder — one and a half million pounds of thrust, 32 million horsepower, and burning 6,000 pounds of rocket grade kerosene and liquid oxygen every second.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was aboard the Seabed Worker as it spent three weeks at sea off Cape Canaveral, recovering engines that had come to rest nearly three miles from the surface. “We’ve seen an underwater wonderland,” he wrote, “an incredible sculpture garden of twisted F-1 engines that tells the story of a fiery and violent end, one that serves testament to the Apollo program[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/apollo_program/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the engines rightly belong to NASA, Mr. Bezos plans to deliver them. One is likely to go to the Smithsonian and the other to the Museum of Flight in Seattle[http://www.museumofflight.org/], near the headquarters of Mr. Bezos’s human spaceflight company, Blue Origin.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s No Heliopause, Silly</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of space, a number of cool things happened since we checked in last week. One was that the Mars[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mars_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] rover, Curiosity, which had been having some pesky computer problems, was restored to good health[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/science/space/on-mars-curiosity-rover-repaired-nasa-says.html?ref=marsplanet] and given an excellent prognosis. Another was that astrophysicists released a map of the infant universe[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/science/space/planck-satellite-shows-image-of-infant-universe.html?ref=science], just 370,000 years after the Big Bang, resplendent with specks that would one day grow into entire galaxies. And then there was the tantalizing report about Voyager 1, which has been hurtling away from the Sun[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/sun/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] since 1977 and aims to become the first manufactured object to leave the solar system. A headline on a news release from the American Geophysical Union suggested that Voyager 1 had entered the heliopause, or beginning of interstellar space, which would be totally exciting. Not so, said NASA quickly[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/science/space/nasas-voyager-1-not-yet-out-of-the-solar-system.html?ref=science], explaining that while the plucky little spacecraft was busy speeding from the Sun at 38,000 miles an hour — and was now an impressive 11.5 billion miles from it — it was too soon to declare heliopause.</p>

While it hasn’t worked for all patients, some have gone into remission, even after chemotherapy had failed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using an eclectic mix of crowd-sourced video, information from <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth and data from nuclear test-ban sensors, scientists have gotten a much more accurate picture of the small asteroid that exploded near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is most clear is that while Chelyabinsk did not exactly dodge a bullet on Feb. 15, the city was fortunate to be only grazed by it. ''The people of Chelyabinsk were very lucky,'' Edward Lu, a former astronaut who now leads the <span class="companylink">B612 Foundation</span>, a private initiative to detect similar asteroids, said at a Congressional hearing last week about the space threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian meteor -- which, according to the latest estimates, was about 60 feet in diameter and came in undetected at roughly 42,000 miles an hour -- was almost 15 miles high when it blew apart. There were no deaths, and most of the 1,500 injuries were from glass as windows shattered when a shock wave hit the city 88 seconds later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it had detonated closer to the ground, it would have been worse,'' said Margaret Campbell-Brown, a member of a team of researchers at the University of Western Ontario who have analyzed the meteor's orbit and characteristics of the blast. It also helped that the meteor was a stony one -- what scientists call an ordinary chondrite -- and not a rarer iron-nickel one, in which case it might have reached the ground before exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blast was the largest fireball since the Tunguska event of 1908, and as videos from surveillance, car-mounted and cellphone cameras quickly began to be posted online, it became apparent that this explosion would be studied like no other, with scientists and amateur bloggers alike rushing to analyze the images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tunguska event involved the detonation of what is generally thought to be a meteor over a remote part of central Siberia. That object may have entered the atmosphere at a steeper angle than the Chelyabinsk meteor -- which came in at an angle of less than 20 degrees from horizontal -- and exploded about five miles above the ground. The lower altitude, as well as the larger size of the Tunguska rock, help explain why it had a much greater impact, flattening trees over an area the size of metropolitan Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Canadian team has calculated that the energy released in the Chelyabinsk explosion was the equivalent of about 440 kilotons of TNT, or about 30 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That calculation was made with the help of data from a network of acoustic sensors set up to monitor compliance with the treaty to ban nuclear weapons testing. There are about 45 of the sensors worldwide, detecting so-called infrasound at frequencies well below the range of human hearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Mützelburg, a spokesman for the <span class="companylink">Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization</span>, which is based in Vienna, said the explosion was detected by more than 20 of the sensors, including one in Antarctica nearly 10,000 miles from Chelyabinsk. Low-frequency sounds do not dissipate easily, so some of the detectors picked up the explosion more than once as the sound circled the globe several times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With knowledge of the energy and information about how fast the meteor was traveling, researchers were then able to calculate the mass of the meteor, about 11,000 metric tons. ''It's all about the kinetic energy of that body,'' which is related to its mass and velocity, said Richard P. Binzel, a planetary scientist at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meteor has a certain amount of energy as it enters the atmosphere, Dr. Binzel said. As it hits the air, it starts to decelerate quickly, and then the stress differential between the superpressurized air in front and the less-pressurized air behind causes the rock to break apart violently. ''All that kinetic energy has to be released,'' he said. Only small fragments of the meteor reached the ground, and some have been brought to laboratories in the United States, including the Institute for Rock Magnetism at the University of Minnesota, where a Russian scientist is studying their magnetic properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other teams, the Canadian researchers have used video images of the meteor's east-to-west trail above Chelyabinsk to help calculate its trajectory and orbit. Since the explosion occurred in daylight, Dr. Campbell-Brown said they asked a colleague there to take night photographs from the same locations. By superimposing the images of the meteor's path over the night images containing stars, the researchers should be able to plot the path even more accurately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, they and other teams, including one from the University of Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia, have established that the meteor originated in the inner part of the asteroid belt, in a regular, harmless orbit around the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. How it came to have an irregular Earth-crossing orbit is not known, but like other Earth crossers it was probably affected by the gravity of Jupiter or another planet at some point. It then circled the Sun every 18 months in a highly eccentric orbit -- more than two and a half times the Earth-Sun distance at its farthest, close to the orbit of Venus at its nearest -- before it smacked into the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jorge Zuluaga, a member of the Colombian group, said he was inspired by work done soon after the event by Stefan Geens, a blogger in Stockholm. Mr. Geens used several videos -- including one from a camera in Revolution Square in central Chelyabinsk -- to triangulate the path. The video does not show the explosion directly, but rather the shadows of lampposts (and of a huge statue of Lenin), which moved like the shadow on a sundial as the fireball crossed the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth, it is easy to pinpoint the coordinates of the Revolution Square camera and others. Dr. Zuluaga said that his team, which included Mr. Geens as a co-author on its most recent paper, is working to improve its calculations by, among other things, learning about the optics of the various video cameras. ''We are trying to understand the distortion we have,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zuluaga thinks that eventually it will be possible to reconstruct the rock's orbit so precisely that researchers may be able to detect it retroactively, by poring over images from sky-surveying telescopes taken the last time it flew near the Earth. ''Then we can assign it a name,'' he said. ''It doesn't have one now, because it's a dead asteroid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to helping scientists plot the meteor's path, the videos that were posted online contributed to a surge in interest in projects to detect asteroids before they strike Earth. In an interview after his Congressional testimony, Dr. Lu said his foundation, which wants to put a privately financed telescope in space within five years, had seen an increase in donations since the explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It made it more real to folks,'' he said. ''There's nothing like a hundred <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos to do that.''</p>
<p>Crowd-sourced video,  information from Google Earth  and data from nuclear test-ban  sensors provided information  about a small asteroid that  exploded last month near  Chelyabinsk, Russia.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MELBOURNE, Fla. -- The day after the shuttle Atlantis landed for the last time at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011, Angel Telles, a man with three master's degrees, scooped up his white Mission 101 coffee mug and drove away from <span class="companylink">NASA</span> after 24 years on the job there. The shuttle era had ended, and with it the jobs of 8,000 <span class="companylink">NASA</span> and civilian workers who found themselves unemployed in the midst of a harsh economic downturn and a crush of home foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So great was the blow to the state and <span class="companylink">NASA</span>'s traditional space program that it put politicians, including presidential candidates, on the defensive on the campaign trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I mean, it was happening before our very eyeballs,'' said Mr. Telles, 50, whose most recent job at <span class="companylink">NASA</span> was developing requirements for new vehicles, as he recalled his last day at the space center. ''This is happening to me? Really? You are in shock.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But then,'' he added, ''you say, 'I am moving on.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did, and finally, this month, Mr. Telles landed a well-paying engineering job with the <span class="companylink">Harris Corporation</span>, an international telecommunications equipment company. His hiring is the latest sign that nearly two years after Brevard County was left staggering from the one-two punch of the downturn and the demise of the shuttle program, the Space Coast, while still struggling, has defied the bleak predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private employers on the Space Coast, which includes Cocoa Beach and Merritt Island, have created more than 4,000 jobs since 2010 and have added 1,000 more this year, including jobs in aerospace, aviation, engineering and other high-technology sectors. Companies like Embraer, which makes jets, <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> and Rocket Crafters were among those that moved here or expanded. Small businesses are also opening at a faster clip. Housing prices are rising, and the pace of foreclosures is slowing in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The linchpin in Brevard's recovery was a plan to diversify beyond aerospace while maintaining its astronaut aura and capitalizing on its coveted labor force: well-trained, highly educated workers with security clearance who have demonstrated the ability to launch manned spacecraft into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone said we were going to get hit by a Category 5 storm -- board up and get ready,'' said Robin Fisher, a Brevard County commissioner from Titusville, which has been slower to recover than the rest of the county. ''After the national program shut down, there were a lot of reasons to fail. But we didn't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future after Atlantis was in many ways guided by the lessons of Apollo. More than four decades ago, this county was built on the gold rush that resulted from the Apollo program, back when astronauts were household names and Cocoa Beach was familiar to television viewers as the home of ''I Dream of Jeannie.'' But in 1972, President Richard M. Nixon shut down the program, decimating the communities surrounding the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 18,000 jobs were lost in 18 months. Some residents walked away from their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cancellation of Apollo was much more abrupt, and it was a lot bigger,'' said Dale Ketcham, who is in charge of strategic alliances for Space Florida, the state's port authority for space and its economic development engine. He grew up in Cocoa Beach and was headed to college at that time. ''The economy was much less robust and diversified, so there really wasn't anything else to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, local and state officials had years to plan for the end of the shuttle program, which was announced by President George W. Bush in 2004, after the Columbia shuttle disintegrated on re-entry. A scaled-down program called Constellation was begun, but that was canceled by President Obama after it, too, became expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the setbacks, Brevard kept one important project: the building of Orion, a multipurpose deep-space capsule. It was the first time the Kennedy Space Center moved from launching a craft to assembling one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months after the shuttle program closed, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> stepped in, announcing it would establish a headquarters at the space center for its new spaceship program to fly astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The program would create 550 jobs by 2015, a relatively small number, but one welcomed nonetheless by local and state officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger challenge was drafting a plan to diversify beyond the traditional parameters of government-run deep-space programs and finding a way to recoup the 8,000 lost jobs little by little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the past three years, more companies have started to roll into Brevard. They have been enticed, in part, by government tax incentives sprinkled liberally across Florida to court business, a practice that has drawn some criticism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem in the past is that there was no plan of action,'' said Lynda Weatherman, the president of the Space Coast's Economic Development Commission. ''It's as much a psychological promotion story as an economic one. It said there is a Chapter 2 in our lives. Part of the reason we got into this situation is because all we did was launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she cautioned, ''We are not out of the woods yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside a state-of-the-art hangar at the Melbourne Airport, Embraer's sleek executive 10-seater jets are being assembled, outfitted and painted. Embraer, a Brazilian company that was voted a top firm to work for in the state by Florida Trend magazine, was courted by 20 states. It moved to Melbourne, a turning point for the area, and opened in February 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason Embraer chose Melbourne was that it wanted the first chance at hiring laid-off shuttle workers. Forty of the employees working on its jets are former <span class="companylink">NASA</span> contractors. Others came from an Air Force base nearby. Embraer recently announced it is building an engineering center here, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew there would be very qualified people that would be valuable to us,'' said Gary Spulak, the president of Embraer Aircraft Holdings. He added that many of the workers already had experience with aircraft like Cessna, Piper and Gulfstream: ''They were all using processes we hold in high regard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has also seen an infusion of companies involved in suborbital spaceflight, like Rocket Crafters and Xcor Aerospace. Last month, Northrup said it planned to add 920 jobs to its aviation operation in the county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, recovery is far from assured. The unemployment rate in Brevard was 8 percent in February, higher than Florida's average and the country's over all. About half of the laid-off shuttle workers have founds jobs here or somewhere else. The rest retired, moved away or were still looking for work, according to Lisa Rice, the president of Brevard Workforce, which helps them find jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severance packages will soon run out for some, raising new concerns. Underemployment is another worry. Disparities have become more pronounced; recovery has been swifter in the southern part of the county, where Melbourne is located. In Titusville, farther north, empty storefronts and houses sit forlorn. Yet there are subtle signs of recovery: An arts movement is budding, and the town's biggest mall is being redeveloped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The county has been split in two,'' Mr. Telles lamented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he did what he could to market himself. He went back to school for an undergraduate degree in engineering. He learned new skills, including how to polish his résumé. But often, he said, employers saw only his degrees and former salary -- and blanched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They just said, 'Do I want to pay that guy this much money before he moves on to something else?' '' Mr. Telles said. On March 5, though, he started his new job at nearly the same salary he had at <span class="companylink">NASA</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are improving,'' he said, ''and as time goes by, it will continue to improve.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A television commercial break during the Super Bowl. The world record for a woman to run a mile. The time it took to board my flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are among the many things that last longer than a total solar eclipse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So taking a 37-hour journey from my home in Pennsylvania to north Queensland, Australia, to view such a fleeting event may not seem like a natural vacation, especially not with your family in tow. But the promise of a prime viewing spot was all it took for me, an astronomy enthusiast, to book a trip last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would be joining the legions of people you could call astrotourists, who, undaunted by the prospect of a cloudy day, travel extraordinary distances for the opportunity to glimpse the latest ex-orbital phenomena. Sure, a meteor streaking across the sky is flashy, especially when it's not expected, but to us, seeing a total solar eclipse is the holy grail, an experience so priceless you wouldn't hesitate to subject yourself and your wife and your young daughters to the time and expense of a 12,000-mile trip to see one. (What's 12,000 miles when you consider the 200,000-odd miles between the Earth and the Moon?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd dreamed of what it must be like to witness an eclipse for years. I'd marveled at images of them. And I knew, from the hours spent gazing through my telescopes at star clusters, galaxies and planets, that firsthand astronomical observations always trumped photos in books or on computer screens. It becomes an experience -- eyepiece views of Saturn and Jupiter are imprinted in my memory in ways Hubble pictures are not. Eclipses, I had heard, were in yet another league. They feel close, powerful. They turn day to night, and reveal our star's complex, gauzy atmosphere in the space of minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really is an amazing visual experience that can become a life-changer for some people,'' said Paul Maley, a retired NASA engineer who organizes eclipse trips with Ring of Fire Expeditions, one of dozens of operators that cater to astrotourists. ''People get different things out of it, and even after seeing more than 40 eclipses, I'm still surprised by how people react. One guy on a trip to Indonesia was so freaked out he hyperventilated. We had to get him a paper bag.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though I hoped it wouldn't come to that for my daughters, Lucy, 11, and Alice, 8, or my wife, Kimberly, I did want us to share a life-altering experience. This particular one was visible only in far north Queensland. And if the eclipse was a bust, there was a fail-safe: we would be within easy distance of the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian Outback and lush rain forests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We arrived at our destination, Port Douglas, a resort town an hour north of Cairns, a few days before the eclipse. It was sunny and warm. We checked in to our boutique hotel -- the Apartments at the White House -- and passed time splashing in the waters of Four Mile Beach a block away, strolling a strip of upscale restaurants and stores that made up the downtown, and exploring nearby Daintree Rain Forest in our rental car. In the evenings, we walked along the beach. The town, then in the off-season, buzzed as it would amid an Australian summer. Thousands of eclipse-chasers had flooded Port Douglas -- among more than 50,000 that came to northern Queensland for the event. (Maley's tour group stayed in Cairns.) The coming eclipse dominated local chatter online, on the air and on the streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day before the eclipse, however, any sense of relaxation I felt vanished when I walked out to the beach before dawn. The horizon above the Coral Sea was filled with puffy clouds. I wasn't alone in my worry. Dozens of other chasers who had come from Asia, the Middle East, the United States, Europe and other points in Australia scanned the sky. Many had no backup plans. Because rental cars were scarce, Port Douglas was their only option. I suddenly felt extremely grateful that I had reserved a car six months in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same day, jet-lag and fatigue caught up with everyone in my family at once, and we spent much of the day in irritable funks. Late afternoon brought more rain than sun, and I had to decide: Should we stick it out with most of the crowd in town and hope for a break in the clouds, or shoot inland to try to find clear skies someplace where coastal weather patterns weren't a factor? That would mean forcing my cranky crew to sleep in our rental car in the Australian Outback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I sensed we had to do it, and Kimberly and the girls gamely agreed. Without a peep of protest, we packed pillows, blankets and snacks into the car and set out for Mareeba, a town about an hour west of Cairns. A local newscaster had tweeted that town as a good Plan B. It's high in the Atherton Tablelands, and famed for its nearly year-round sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We drove in darkness and rain along slow, twisting roads, arriving in Mareeba before midnight. As we prowled the countryside looking for a reasonably secure place to park, we spotted other cars and vans filled with people also camped by the side of the road. A herd of kangaroos -- our first in-the-wild spotting -- bounded from the woods and across our headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We settled on an empty park. I thought the girls had fallen asleep until I heard a drowsy exclamation from Lucy: ''Look at the sky!'' We got out. It was crystal clear, and thanks to the lack of light pollution, the inky black sky was studded with thousands of bright stars. We spotted a slew of targets that you can't see in the Northern Hemisphere: the Southern Cross, multiple spectacular star clusters, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds -- two enormous galaxies that look like clouds hanging in the air. It was a stunning interlude before a few hours of rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At dawn, we went to a coffee plantation called Skybury, which had a virtually cloudless, blue-sky view nearly all the way to the coast. A crowd had gathered there, and the staff was brewing coffee. I set up a compact five-inch aperture Celestron telescope and a dedicated solar scope, the latter of which is the only way to view the progression of the eclipse before the moon completely obscures the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show started around 6:30. A modest bite on the left of the sun grew, turning it into a deep crescent. As the sun was shrinking to a sliver, the air grew cooler and the terrain took on a darker hue. Shadows became strangely acute, as the dimmed overhead light focused more intensely than the dimmed angled light of sunrise or sunset. We saw hot-air balloons in the valley below us. Someone nearby pointed up and shouted ''Venus!'' The planet shone brightly as we rotated into the Moon's shadow. Other stars emerged, no longer outshone by the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the sun swiftly became a mere pinprick before the moon completely -- and perfectly -- blotted it out. A bright halo, shimmering and alive, was the only indication of its existence. It grew dark, and the birds around us hushed. People gasped. I looked at Kimberly and the girls on their blanket; they sat there watching, their mouths hanging open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realized how inadequate all the photos I've seen of an eclipse are. They lack context -- the sky, the ground, the bits of brightness visible around the edge of the sun's shadow at the horizon. Many people say they feel small and insignificant when observing the universe in all its vastness. But I felt connected to the cosmos, part of a perfect machine. I stood squarely in the shadow of the Moon, marveling at the watchwork synchrony, the strangeness and the singular cosmic coincidence that had brought me there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Totality -- the time that the sun is completely blocked -- lasted for nearly two minutes, and seemed to end as quickly as it began. The sun re-emerged, first as a bright dot on the edge of the halo that gave the illusion of a diamond ring. Sunlight fell back on us; the birds resumed chirping. Everyone breathed loudly and applauded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EYES ON THE HEAVENS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenya A major total solar eclipse will cross the African continent Nov. 3, with Kenya being the optimal viewing point. It will be a rare hybrid eclipse, which means some people will see a total eclipse while others will see a partial one. Totality will be brief -- only 15 seconds -- but you'll be able to fold in plenty of other adventures while in Kenya. Sky &amp; Telescope magazine (skyandtelescope.com) is sponsoring a weeklong tour at $5,695 for a double and $6,389 for single occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic Ocean To see a full minute of the total eclipse in November, consider a 10-day cruise with Ring of Fire Expeditions (eclipsetours.com), priced from $4,469 to $13,499. It starts in Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, catches the eclipse in the Atlantic Ocean, then continues to Barbados.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desert near La Serena, Chile This is a dark-sky site, far away from the light pollution from urban and suburban locations that can wipe out the Milky Way and make most nebula, galaxies and star clusters impossible to see. It is also home to a hotel called Elqui Domos (elquidomos.cl), which has telescopes on hand and domed rooms with views of the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaska The state is a prime viewing location for the aurora borealis, which generates some of the most astonishing astronomical experiences imaginable. AlaskaTours.com arranges viewings of the northern lights from the Fairbanks area, including the Chena Hot Springs Resort.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A television commercial break during the Super Bowl. The world record for a woman to run a mile. The time it took to board my flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are among the many things that last longer than a total solar eclipse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So taking a 37-hour journey from my home in Pennsylvania to north Queensland, Australia, to view such a fleeting event may not seem like a natural vacation, especially not with your family in tow. But the promise of a prime viewing spot was all it took for me, an astronomy enthusiast, to book a trip last November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would be joining the legions of people you could call astrotourists, who, undaunted by the prospect of a cloudy day, travel extraordinary distances for the opportunity to glimpse the latest ex-orbital phenomena. Sure, a meteor streaking across the sky is flashy, especially when it’s not expected, but to us, seeing a total solar eclipse is the holy grail, an experience so priceless you wouldn’t hesitate to subject yourself and your wife and your young daughters to the time and expense of a 12,000-mile trip to see one. (What’s 12,000 miles when you consider the 200,000-odd miles between the Earth and the Moon?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’d dreamed of what it must be like to witness an eclipse for years. I’d marveled at images of them. And I knew, from the hours spent gazing through my telescopes at star clusters, galaxies and planets, that firsthand astronomical observations always trumped photos in books or on computer screens. It becomes an experience — eyepiece views of Saturn and Jupiter are imprinted in my memory in ways Hubble pictures are not. Eclipses, I had heard, were in yet another league. They feel close, powerful. They turn day to night, and reveal our star’s complex, gauzy atmosphere in the space of minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It really is an amazing visual experience that can become a life-changer for some people,” said Paul Maley, a retired NASA engineer who organizes eclipse trips with Ring of Fire Expeditions, one of dozens of operators that cater to astrotourists. “People get different things out of it, and even after seeing more than 40 eclipses, I’m still surprised by how people react. One guy on a trip to Indonesia was so freaked out he hyperventilated. We had to get him a paper bag.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though I hoped it wouldn’t come to that for my daughters, Lucy, 11, and Alice, 8, or my wife, Kimberly, I did want us to share a life-altering experience. This particular one was visible only in far north Queensland. And if the eclipse was a bust, there was a fail-safe: we would be within easy distance of the Great Barrier Reef, the Australian Outback and lush rain forests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We arrived at our destination, Port Douglas, a resort town an hour north of Cairns, a few days before the eclipse. It was sunny and warm. We checked in to our boutique hotel — the Apartments at the White House — and passed time splashing in the waters of Four Mile Beach a block away, strolling a strip of upscale restaurants and stores that made up the downtown, and exploring nearby Daintree Rain Forest in our rental car. In the evenings, we walked along the beach. The town, then in the off-season, buzzed as it would amid an Australian summer. Thousands of eclipse-chasers had flooded Port Douglas — among more than 50,000 that came to northern Queensland for the event. (Maley’s tour group stayed in Cairns.) The coming eclipse dominated local chatter online, on the air and on the streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day before the eclipse, however, any sense of relaxation I felt vanished when I walked out to the beach before dawn. The horizon above the Coral Sea was filled with puffy clouds. I wasn’t alone in my worry. Dozens of other chasers who had come from Asia, the Middle East, the United States, Europe and other points in Australia scanned the sky. Many had no backup plans. Because rental cars were scarce, Port Douglas was their only option. I suddenly felt extremely grateful that I had reserved a car six months in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same day, jet-lag and fatigue caught up with everyone in my family at once, and we spent much of the day in irritable funks. Late afternoon brought more rain than sun, and I had to decide: Should we stick it out with most of the crowd in town and hope for a break in the clouds, or shoot inland to try to find clear skies someplace where coastal weather patterns weren’t a factor? That would mean forcing my cranky crew to sleep in our rental car in the Australian Outback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I sensed we had to do it, and Kimberly and the girls gamely agreed. Without a peep of protest, we packed pillows, blankets and snacks into the car and set out for Mareeba, a town about an hour west of Cairns. A local newscaster had tweeted that town as a good Plan B. It’s high in the Atherton Tablelands, and famed for its nearly year-round sunshine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We drove in darkness and rain along slow, twisting roads, arriving in Mareeba before midnight. As we prowled the countryside looking for a reasonably secure place to park, we spotted other cars and vans filled with people also camped by the side of the road. A herd of kangaroos — our first in-the-wild spotting — bounded from the woods and across our headlights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We settled on an empty park. I thought the girls had fallen asleep until I heard a drowsy exclamation from Lucy: “Look at the sky!” We got out. It was crystal clear, and thanks to the lack of light pollution, the inky black sky was studded with thousands of bright stars. We spotted a slew of targets that you can’t see in the Northern Hemisphere: the Southern Cross, multiple spectacular star clusters, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds — two enormous galaxies that look like clouds hanging in the air. It was a stunning interlude before a few hours of rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At dawn, we went to a coffee plantation called Skybury, which had a virtually cloudless, blue-sky view nearly all the way to the coast. A crowd had gathered there, and the staff was brewing coffee. I set up a compact five-inch aperture Celestron telescope and a dedicated solar scope, the latter of which is the only way to view the progression of the eclipse before the moon completely obscures the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show started around 6:30. A modest bite on the left of the sun grew, turning it into a deep crescent. As the sun was shrinking to a sliver, the air grew cooler and the terrain took on a darker hue. Shadows became strangely acute, as the dimmed overhead light focused more intensely than the dimmed angled light of sunrise or sunset. We saw hot-air balloons in the valley below us. Someone nearby pointed up and shouted “Venus!” The planet shone brightly as we rotated into the Moon’s shadow. Other stars emerged, no longer outshone by the sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, the sun swiftly became a mere pinprick before the moon completely — and perfectly — blotted it out. A bright halo, shimmering and alive, was the only indication of its existence. It grew dark, and the birds around us hushed. People gasped. I looked at Kimberly and the girls on their blanket; they sat there watching, their mouths hanging open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realized how inadequate all the photos I’ve seen of an eclipse are. They lack context — the sky, the ground, the bits of brightness visible around the edge of the sun’s shadow at the horizon. Many people say they feel small and insignificant when observing the universe in all its vastness. But I felt connected to the cosmos, part of a perfect machine. I stood squarely in the shadow of the Moon, marveling at the watchwork synchrony, the strangeness and the singular cosmic coincidence that had brought me there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Totality — the time that the sun is completely blocked — lasted for nearly two minutes, and seemed to end as quickly as it began. The sun re-emerged, first as a bright dot on the edge of the halo that gave the illusion of a diamond ring. Sunlight fell back on us; the birds resumed chirping. Everyone breathed loudly and applauded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EYES ON THE HEAVENS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenya A major total solar eclipse will cross the African continent Nov. 3, with Kenya being the optimal viewing point. It will be a rare hybrid eclipse, which means some people will see a total eclipse while others will see a partial one. Totality will be brief — only 15 seconds — but you’ll be able to fold in plenty of other adventures while in Kenya. Sky &amp; Telescope magazine (skyandtelescope.com[http://skyandtelescope.com]) is sponsoring a weeklong tour at $5,695 for a double and $6,389 for single occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantic Ocean To see a full minute of the total eclipse in November, consider a 10-day cruise with Ring of Fire Expeditions (eclipsetours.com[http://eclipsetours.com]), priced from $4,469 to $13,499. It starts in Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, catches the eclipse in the Atlantic Ocean, then continues to Barbados.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desert near La Serena, Chile This is a dark-sky site, far away from the light pollution from urban and suburban locations that can wipe out the Milky Way and make most nebula, galaxies and star clusters impossible to see. It is also home to a hotel called Elqui Domos (elquidomos.cl[http://elquidomos.cl]), which has telescopes on hand and domed rooms with views of the night sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaska The state is a prime viewing location for the aurora borealis, which generates some of the most astonishing astronomical experiences imaginable. AlaskaTours.com[http://AlaskaTours.com] arranges viewings of the northern lights from the Fairbanks area, including the Chena Hot Springs Resort.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the International Space Station flew over New York on March 23 (yielding this dazzling nighttime cityscape[http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2480.html]), it’s safe to say that crew members were not thinking about Danforth W. Toan. But 45 years earlier, before some of the crew members were even born, he was thinking about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toan, who died on Jan. 16 at 94, was among the first architects to wrestle seriously with the challenges of creating long-term living quarters in space. He is better known in his profession as the designer of academic buildings[http://www.architectmagazine.com/architects/architect-danforth-w-toan-designer-of-libraries-dies-at-94.aspx], especially libraries, and better known among his neighbors in Tappan, N.Y., as a leader of the 1990s “Vinyl Wars[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/nyregion/vinyl-wars-divide-a-hamlet-tappan-board-s-ban-on-siding-angers-some-homeowners.html],” which pitted traditionalists who favored the historic look of clapboard — he was one of them — against homeowners who wanted the freedom to reclad their homes in vinyl siding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What captivated me, however, were Mr. Toan’s explorations of how to make a space station habitable, as well as the simple tools he brought to his task: sketchpads, color slides, videotape and scale models that were almost literally built of bubble gum and baling wire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1967, his architectural firm, Warner Burns Toan Lunde of 724 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, won a contract to advise the Grumman Corporation of Bethpage, N.Y., for what would eventually be Grumman’s bid to construct an orbiting space station. Mr. Toan worked on the project for the next 20 years, until Grumman was bypassed as a prime contractor by the <span class="companylink">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have to find some compromise between the cockpit environment of present spacecraft and the luxury of a hotel,” he told John Noble Wilford of The New York Times early in 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Nov. 1 that year, a few month after Apollo 11 had successfully landed on the moon, The New Yorker published an interview with Mr. Toan that considered the challenge of a prolonged stay in space. “The problem cannot be solved by reference to the Apollo spacecraft,” the magazine said, “for the difference between building a craft in which three men spend eight days to make a round trip to the moon and one in which groups of a dozen men will be spending six-month hitches in space is the difference between designing a car and designing a house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toan was quick to grasp that a space station, though extraordinarily confined, would offer advantages available in no other environment: zero gravity, for starters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Space expands in proportion to how much of it you can use, almost as if you had increased its size,” he said. “A cell seven feet square is very constricting, but if the cell were seven feet high, making a volume of 343 cubic feet, and if the man inside it could float around, reorienting himself however he wanted — curling up on the ceiling if he got tired of the floor — the space would seem much bigger.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Yorker noted, “Mr. Toan has anticipated the need for a certain amount of privacy, and, accordingly, on each deck there are four private rooms, each of them a cubicle seven feet on a side.” It added that the architect had “solved the problem of keeping an astronaut down in his bunk by providing a strap to go across his waist, but he said he wasn’t sure this was the best solution, because the head and feet would be left floating. He was now thinking of putting the astronaut into a sort of lightly restraining sleeping bag.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flash forward to an amateur video made in the mid-1980s in a Grumman hangar at Bethpage, starring Mr. Toan’s young architectural colleagues as blue-suited astronauts in their space station home. An astronaut played by Rick Bell[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2013/02/130206-Tribute-Danforth-W-Toan-1918-2013.asp] (now executive director of the New York chapter of the <span class="companylink">American Institute of Architects</span>) is shown, with bedtime reading, cosseted in a lightly restraining sleeping bag on one wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flash forward another 20 years to Capt. Sunita L. Williams[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/williams-s.html], commander of the 33rd expedition to the space station in 2012, as she gave a guided video tour[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/suni_iss_tour.html] of the crew’s quarters: four private spaces arrayed around the central passageway. And what’s on one wall of her room? “I’ve got a sleeping bag right here that we sleep in,” she said, “so we don’t — sort of like a little bit of a cover — we don’t fly all over the place.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bell said that Mr. Toan, whom he considered a mentor, was “always thinking outside the box,” which had made him an ideal choice as a subcontractor for Grumman. “They wanted someone who could think about habitability in the abstract,” Mr. Bell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For inspiration, Mr. Toan would watch “Star Trek” with his son, Braden. He also made a point of seeing “2001: A Space Odyssey.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“He just couldn’t believe the whole thing was happening,” the younger Mr. Toan recalled. “Dad normally got up at 9. When this started, he’d wake up at 5 because he was so excited.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dark side of the universe is whispering, but scientists are still not sure what it is saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel Ting, a professor at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> and a Nobel laureate particle physicist, said Wednesday that his $1.6 billion cosmic ray experiment on the International Space Station had found evidence of ''new physical phenomena'' that could represent dark matter, the mysterious stuff that serves as the gravitational foundation for galaxies and whose identification would rewrite some of the laws of physics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results, he said, confirmed previous reports that local interstellar space is crackling with an unexplained abundance of high energy particles, especially positrons, the antimatter version of the familiar electrons that comprise electricity and chemistry. They could be colliding particles of dark matter. Or they could be could be coming from previously undiscovered pulsars or other astronomical monsters, throwing off wild winds of radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tantalizing news is that even with the new data, physicists cannot tell yet which is the right answer, but they are encouraged that they soon might be able to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it makes you believe it must be dark matter, nor do I think it makes you believe it cannot be,'' said Neal Weiner, a particle theorist at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, as Dr. Ting's instrument is called, is only two years into what could be a 20-year voyage on the space station, and is working brilliantly. ''Over the coming months, A.M.S. will be able to tell us conclusively whether these positrons are a signal for dark matter, or whether they have some other origin,'' Dr. Ting told an audience of physicists at CERN, the <span class="companylink">European Organization for Nuclear Research</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report will be published in Physical Review Letters on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers and others from outside the collaboration responded enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A.M.S. has confirmed with exquisite precision and to high energy one of the most exciting mysteries in astrophysics and particle physics,'' said Justin Vandenbroucke of the University of Wisconsin and Stanford's SLAC laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Spiropulu, a Caltech particle physicist, said, ''They have exquisitely small errors and they stop the plot at the cliffhanger, so we will be asking for more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, like Gregory Tarle of the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>, cautioned that uncertainties in the galactic background of radiation might make it impossible to ever get a clean answer to the source of the positrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark matter has teased and obsessed astronomers since the 1930s, when the Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky deduced that some invisible ''missing mass'' was required to supply the gravitational glue to hold clusters of galaxies together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to recent measurements by the Planck spacecraft, about 27 percent of the universe, by mass, is composed of some unknown form of matter unlike the atoms that make up us and everything we can see. Astronomers cannot see it, but they can detect its gravitational tug pulling the galaxies and stars around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out what this stuff is is important for more than cosmology. The most favored candidates for its identity are as yet undiscovered particles known as WIMPs -- weakly interacting massive particles -- left over from the Big Bang. Such particles could drift through the Earth like wind through a screen door. Impervious to almost everything except gravity, they would form a shadow universe clumping together into invisible clouds that then attract ordinary matter. Discovering one of them could give a lift to new theories of physics, like supersymmetry, which predicts of a whole new spectrum of so-called superpartners to the particles we already know about, not to mention explicating the nature of more than a quarter of creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until now, the dark matter particles have mostly eluded direct detection in the laboratory or creation at the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sky could be a different story. Such WIMPs floating in the halos around galaxies would occasionally collide and annihilate one another in tiny fireballs of radiation and lighter particles, the theorists Michael Turner of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span> and Frank Wilczek of M.I.T. suggested in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is one of the most expensive, complicated and controversial experiments ever mounted in space. Built by an army of 600 scientists from 16 countries, including Italy, Germany, Russia, China and Taiwan, it took 16 years from its approval in 1995 by NASA's administrator at the time, Dan Goldin, to get to space, on the next-to-last shuttle flight, in May 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then there were already intimations of dark matter in the heavens. Pamela, a satellite built by Italian, German, Russian and Swedish scientists, registered an excess of anti-electrons, or positrons, in space -- perhaps, they said, from collisions of dark matter particles. Using data from the Fermi satellite, researchers at Stanford were also able to detect a similar excess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting said his spectrometer had validated those observations with more detail and much better statistics. Among other things, as best the A.M.S. team can tell, the positrons are coming equally from all directions -- a result that would favor dark matter, which should be spread evenly through the galaxy, rather than pulsars, which would be localized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But none of the experiments has yet observed what Dr. Turner called the smoking gun of dark matter. If the signal is coming from colliding WIMPs, the theory says, the ratio of positrons to electrons will rise as the energy of the positrons and electrons rises, flattens and then drops sharply. The cutoff energy represents the mass-energy of the putative dark matter particle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of pulsars, the fraction of positrons would drop much more slowly and gradually, physicists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space station spectrometer can record particles with energies as high as a trillion electron volts, Dr. Ting said, and indeed in his talk he showed individual events with positrons and electrons having energies of some 600 billion electron volts. But the data presented Wednesday ranges in energy only from a few million to 350 billion electron volts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That data is summarized in a plot that shows the ratio of positrons to electrons rising rapidly and then ever more slowly as the energy increases. The plot runs out of data, Dr. Turner noted, just where the telltale drop should start taking place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At CERN, Dr. Ting declined to answer questions or speculate about what happened in the empty spot at higher energies on his graph, or even when he would know. ''Slowly,'' he answered when asked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Saturday night at Restaurant Bareiss, an eight-table dining room in this small town in the Black Forest, and the chef, Claus-Peter Lumpp, needed seven orders of John Dory in garam masala. Three line cooks darted around him, fussing over black plates laid out under a heating lamp, saucing and garnishing and somehow not running into one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany was not, until very recently, known for its chefs, but it does have a reputation for quality control. Chefs used syringes to deliver pinpoint droplets of sauce and tested temperatures with yellow electric thermometers that looked like Geiger counters. The bulk of the cooking takes place on nine electric burners that were made to Mr. Lumpp’s exact specifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Ten seconds,’’ Mr. Lumpp announced. ‘‘Jawohl!’’ his team answered in unison, as they prepared sugar snaps and chickpea crème to serve with the fish. Otherwise, the kitchen was bereft of conversation. As a rule, Mr. Lumpp doesn’t raise his voice. He doesn’t need to: During the entire Saturday-evening service, the only misfire was a wasted langoustine. He poked it with a knife and scrunched his face ever so slightly. When he turned around, Philipp Prinzbach, a 22-year-old line cook, flung the shellfish into the trash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The consistency was mushy,’’ Mr. Prinzbach said the next day. But Mr. Lumpp, expressing his cooperative approach, praised the young cook for coming up with the idea of the langoustine dish in the first place. ‘‘The old authoritarian model won’t work anymore,’’ Mr. Lumpp, 49, said when asked about his kitchen management style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wolfgang Puck, whose mother was a hotel chef in Austria, started training as a chef when he was 14. Mr. Lumpp, who earned a coveted third star in the 2008 Michelin guide, had other plans. ‘‘My dream job was auto mechanic,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His culinary ascent began with the simple urge to drop out of high school around the time of his 16th birthday. His mother gave him permission to leave school, but only if he found an apprenticeship. Germany is famous for its vocational education: The country’s ‘‘duale ausbildung,’’ or dual-training system, combines apprenticeship in the workplace with rigorous lessons at state-run schools. Mr. Lumpp became an apprentice in the kitchen at the Hotel Bareiss. After his military service (spent as the chef at an officers’ club in Karlsruhe) and a short, unhappy stay in Düsseldorf, he returned to the Bareiss. With the exception of a year interning in three-star kitchens across Europe, including Alain Ducasse’s in Monte Carlo, he has remained there since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baiersbronn in the state of Baden-Württemberg has a population of only about 16,000. The region is known for its large number of entrepreneurial businesses, and several of Germany’s medium-size family-owned enterprises make their home here, like Müller Mitteltal, which custom-builds heavy-duty trailers and whose factory sits at the bottom of the hill below the Bareiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Baiersbronn is now on its way to becoming recognized as the world’s most unexpected restaurant capital. The Bareiss’s rival, the Schwarzwaldstube, at the Hotel Traube Tonbach, also has three Michelin stars, giving this isolated municipality the same number of three-star restaurants as London and twice as many as Chicago. The town is also home to a one-star restaurant at the Hotel Sackmann. Only a 30-minute drive away in Bad Peterstal-Griesbach is a two-star restaurant at the Hotel Dollenberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his last State of the Union address, President Barack Obama said America should emulate Germany’s knack for producing skilled workers. He was referring to fields like engineering and computer science, but he could just as easily have been talking about high-end cooking. In the same way that Germany succeeds at making drills and luxury automobiles, the country’s apprenticeship process is successfully creating top restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before it became a culinary destination, Baiersbronn was known for the rivalry between Hermine Bareiss, the founder of what would become the Hotel Bareiss, and Willi Finkbeiner, who expanded his family’s small inn into the Hotel Traube Tonbach. ‘‘If one built a suite, then the other had to have one,’’ said Patrick Schreib, the town’s tourism director. ‘‘One built a spa, the other wanted a spa.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the Finkbeiners who first recognized the potential of an upscale restaurant. In the late 1970s, gourmet cooking was just beginning to make inroads in Germany, which was better known for hearty home cooking, dumplings, sausage and marinated pork roast. The new German haute cuisine is rooted in classic French cooking but uninhibited by tradition — chefs here feel less bound to specific customs or ingredients than many of their French and Italian counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harald Wohlfahrt has watched the evolution unfold over the decades. In 1977, Willi Finkbeiner sent him to learn from Eckart Witzigmann, a culinary pioneer in Munich who had introduced nouvelle cuisine to a skeptical German public. It turned out to be an inspired step by the hotelier. As Germans became richer and had more money to spend on fine dining, it became possible to imagine moving beyond sauerkraut and sausage. In 1980, Finkbeiner made Mr. Wohlfahrt the head chef at his restaurant, the Schwarzwaldstube.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wohlfahrt, 57, has defended his three Michelin stars for more than two decades. He has developed meals for European astronauts in orbit. He has cooked for the Dalai Lama, the Clintons and George Clooney. Patricia Schultz’s best-selling omnibus travel guide, ‘‘1,000 Places to See Before You Die,’’ implores readers to ‘‘witness his signature grilled pigeon with chanterelle mushrooms.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is, in short, the dean of German chefs — and indeed five of the nine other three-star chefs now working in Germany trained in his kitchen. He will not reveal, however, who will be the stars of tomorrow. Mr. Wohlfahrt forbade me to identify the chefs working under him today, because he is afraid the ‘‘smooth operators and headhunters’’ might turn up and try to lure them away before they are ready to lead their own restaurants. ‘‘It’s about discovering the talent and promoting it,’’ he said. ‘‘Then they can move on.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Giggling, joking and the smell of stewing meat filled a kitchen at the Paul Kerschensteiner School in Bad Überkingen, where the Hotel Bareiss and the Hotel Traube Tonbach send many of their top apprentices. Students gathered at four stations to prepare, with varying degrees of success, Hungarian ‘‘pörkölt,’’ a stew similar to goulash, over homemade noodles with a side salad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volker Wilsch, an accomplished chef who has worked in several kitchens with Michelin stars, walked from station to station, calmly directing the students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The less pressure the better,’’ he told a young woman cranking dough through a pasta maker. ‘‘Nina, normally you cut that very small,’’ he said to another student. ‘‘Much too much liquid,’’ he cautioned a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These students, like their counterparts in other industries, are known as ‘‘azubis,’’ an abbreviation of ‘‘auszubildende,’’ which means something like ‘‘trainees.’’ The dual-training system is evidence of the close cooperation between business, the state and workers that helps account for Germany’s success, both in niche industries and big multinational enterprises like <span class="companylink">Siemens</span> and Mercedes. Vocational schools are financed and run by the states. Would-be apprentices apply not to the schools but to businesses, which decide how many future employees they need to have trained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system is not without its drawbacks. It has been criticized for steering the children of the wealthy into universities and working-class kids into lower-paying jobs; there have been complaints that managers rarely choose minority applicants for the most coveted spots. Compensation in the form of stipends can be quite low, too: Azubis in the elite cooking program receive from $750 to $900 a month. It’s not easy to live on that, but it compares favorably with American college graduates leaving school tens of thousands of dollars in debt and lacking marketable skills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Instead of learning purely theory or just performing handwork,’’ Mr. Lumpp said of the practice of alternating on-the-job training and classroom instruction, ‘‘you get both pillars, handwork and theory.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kerschensteiner School’s curriculum tries to cover all aspects of the restaurant-and-hotel business — for instance, training chefs and servers together so they understand the demands of the kitchen and of the diners. From handling the clients to kitchen hygiene, aspiring chefs learn more than how to make a soufflé. While Mr. Wilsch’s students were washing up after their stews, the apprentices in a classroom downstairs were learning about salmonella, staph and botulism from a chef and restaurateur with a degree in nutrition science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it was time to compare the outcomes in the cooking classroom, Mr. Wilsch surveyed four plates of pörkölt. The gravies ranged from red to brown; the garnishes varied from whole leaves of parsley to unidentifiable tiny green slivers. Some pasta resembled linguine, some looked like double-wide fettuccine. One group had experimented with pink-tinted pasta — which clashed with the paprika-red goulash. ‘‘The noodles themselves are pretty,’’ Mr. Wilsch said encouragingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His classroom is a safe place, he said, in which to try and fail. ‘‘What’s nice here is that in contrast to the businesses, there’s no boss yelling, no guest waiting,’’ Mr. Wilsch added later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first thing you see upon entering the Hotel Bareiss is a vase filled with red roses next to a bronze bust of the founder, Hermine Bareiss. The widowed Hermine founded the hotel in 1951, just as tourism in the Black Forest began to swell. Trains from the industrial Ruhr Valley would disgorge oxygen-starved workers seeking a few days away from the pollution of the coal mines and steel mills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1966, as the hotel was still growing, she sent her son Hermann, who studied cooking and worked in restaurants and hotels from Paris to Cairo, an ultimatum: ‘‘Move home,’’ she told him, ‘‘or I’m selling.’’ He did, and eventually presided over the expansion of the hotel, which today has 230 beds and 260 full-time employees, along with a spa and sports facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Hotel Bareiss doesn’t churn out widgets, it fits the definition of a ‘‘mittelstand’’ firm, one of the privately owned small- and medium-size companies that employ about two out of three German workers. The archaic sense of the term dates to medieval times, and essentially means the bourgeoisie. Today it refers to companies with anywhere from a dozen to a few hundred employees, and it evokes certain old-fashioned business virtues: an aversion to debt, a paternalistic sense of responsibility for employees and a focus on long-term planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the Finkbeiners at the Hotel Traube Tonbach described the attitude of these family-owned enterprises as ‘‘thinking in generations rather than quarters.’’ That means reinvestment, but because the families lack the resources of publicly traded hotel chains or new Emirati or Russian wealth, it also means picking your battles when making business plans. Hermann Bareiss said his family couldn’t afford to compete on what he called ‘‘hardware’’ — marble floors, gold fixtures, even artificial islands. Instead, it has chosen to compete in the realm of ‘‘software,’’ by which he meant his workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The globalization of the travel industry has made the environment much more challenging for a hotel in Baiersbronn. There are no more trainloads full of steelworkers showing up in town; they can fly cheaply to Rome or London instead. ‘‘We don’t have Alps or top winter-sports areas,’’ Mr. Bareiss said. ‘‘There’s no sea or beaches.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it has been for his mittelstand counterparts who make the tiny steering device rather than the car, the elevator motor rather than the skyscraper, specialization is necessary to stay at the forefront. The specialization, born of cutthroat competition with the Hotel Traube Tonbach, was gourmet cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bareiss and the Traube Tonbach have been locked in competition for more than six decades, but both sides seem to realize that the relationship is increasingly symbiotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an age of easy travel to so many exotic, more famous places, it’s hard to imagine anyone taking the trouble to get to Stuttgart and then drive more than an hour into the deepest corners of the Black Forest to get to one three-star restaurant. But someone might make the effort to visit two. With the Hotel Sackmann and the Hotel Dollenberg, a guest could come for a weekend and have two three-star dinners and two lunches at starred restaurants. The region has entered a virtuous cycle, where little restaurants can also get fresh fish delivered twice a day. Who knows where the next star might come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, there isn’t a concept binding the German restaurant scene together — a unifying trend that everyone has to come here to try — just excellent cooking learned through an efficient system. I told Mr. Wilsch at the Kerschensteiner School that the stereotypical young chef in America is an art-school dropout washing dishes, then chopping onions and slowly revealing a knack for cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Creativity,’’ Mr. Wilsch blurted out approvingly. The haphazard development of young American cooks still appealed to him, the mystique of their self-made geniuses set against the technical mastery of his highly trained young craftspeople. There’s a different quality when ‘‘the chef is self-motivated,’’ he said, ‘‘not forced into fixed cupboards.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT'S OUT THERE? JUST DO THE MATH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have recently found planets orbiting stars other than our sun (exoplanets) that could be similar to Earth. Studying these planets will provide clues to how Earth itself formed and evolved. Are there natural environments like the Earth's? How many might there be? Ben R. Oppenheimer, chairman of the Department of Astrophysics, <span class="companylink">American Museum of Natural History</span>, provides estimates from the latest science. Just fill in the blanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Our sun is one of about 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, but it is not typical. In fact, only about 5 percent of stars are similar in mass and luminosity to the sun. There are ____ stars in the galaxy similar to our sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Recent results from NASA's Kepler space observatory indicate that 23 percent of sunlike stars have Earth-size planets in orbit around them. The maximum number of Earth-size planets orbiting sunlike stars in the galaxy is ____.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. If 10 percent of those planets are at a similar distance from their suns as Earth is from its sun (so that the temperature range is right for liquid water to exist on the surface), there could be ____ Earth-like planets in the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. There are 150 stars similar to the sun within 70 light-years of our solar system. Using the galaxy-wide percentages, we could expect ____ of them to host an Earth-like planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIFE IN THE BALANCE: OUR WORLD AND OTHERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It makes sense that NASA, the people behind the Kepler mission to find other potentially habitable planets, would pay attention to Earth Day (April 22). This year, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab at the California Institute of Technology put together questions on planets beyond our solar system. To learn more, visit NASA's PlanetQuest Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Man isn't the only threat to the planet. Which circumstance could end life on Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a. The aging sun continues to heat up. In a billion years, Earth gets too hot, oceans evaporate, carbon dioxide disappears, plant life dies out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. A huge asteroid smashes into Earth, vaporizing vast swaths of the surface and permanently changing the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. All of the above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">d. None of the above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Mars once had running water that carved canyons and other features into its surface. What happened to the water?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a. Mars is just too far from the sun and too cold to sustain water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. Marsquakes caused all the water to seep into cracks in the crust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. An asteroid clobbered Mars and vaporized the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">d. Most of Mars's atmosphere, and water, evaporated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Earth isn't the only body in the solar system with rivers and lakes. Which other world has similar features?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a. Mercury (liquid lead)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. Saturn's moon Titan (liquid methane)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. Saturn (liquid oxygen)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">d. Neptune's moon Triton (liquid ammonia)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Earth and Venus are rocky planets of about the same size, but Earth's average surface temperature is about 59° F (15° C), while Venus's is 1350° F (732° C), hot enough to melt lead or aluminum. Why the difference?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a. Venus has a stronger greenhouse effect than Earth has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. Venus is made of denser rock than Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. Earth is more geologically active than Venus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">d. Ice caps and oceans on Earth absorb energy from the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Earth is called a ''Goldilocks planet'' because:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a. The amount of land surface is not too big, not too small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. Its distance from the sun is ''just right'' for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. It has bears on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">d. Scientists don't refer to Earth this way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Earth's magnetic field shields us from harmful solar wind and also helps Earth hold onto its atmosphere and water. To what do we owe this invisible protector?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a. The aurora borealis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">b. Plate tectonics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">c. Earth's circulating liquid metal core</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">d. Iron in Earth's crust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True or False</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Earth is the only body in the solar system thought to have oceans of liquid water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Earth is smack in the middle of the ''habitable zone'' around the sun, where temperatures are right for liquid water to exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Exoplanets that have lots of volcanic activity and exist in systems with lots of asteroids are considered bad prospects for looking for extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Small, Earth-size planets are a rarity in the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GO TO ANSWERS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT’S OUT THERE? JUST DO THE MATH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. 10 billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. 2.3 billion</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. 230 million, conservatively. Many factors play a role, but this number suggests there may be many habitable planets in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Three or four. The math is simple: 23 percent of sunlike stars have Earth-size planets around them; 10 percent of those are Earth-like. So 10 percent of 23 percent, or 2.3 percent, of sunlike stars could host a habitable planet. Within 70 light-years, star catalogs show, there are about 150 sunlike stars. So 2.3 percent of those could have a habitable planet. Seventy light-years is about how far stronger human radio transmissions have spread out into the galaxy, meaning if there were in fact intelligent life on these planets, in principal they could have discovered us by now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIFE IN THE BALANCE: OUR WORLD AND OTHERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. c. Scientists believe the first scenario is a certainty and the second just a matter of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. d.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. b.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. a. Venus’s atmosphere is almost all heat-trapping carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. b. A Goldilocks planet falls within a star’s habitable zone and is neither too close nor too far from a star to rule out liquid water on its surface, and thus life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. c. The magnetic field is essential for life and a defining characteristic of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. False. Scientists think Jupiter’s moon Europa has an ocean of liquid water under its icy surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. False. The habitable zone around the sun extends roughly from Venus to Mars. Earth is relatively close to the inner (warm) edge, not the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. False. Volcanoes push out water vapor and other chemicals that help make for a life-sustaining atmosphere, and icy asteroids and comets may have helped bring water to Earth’s surface when it was forming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. False. The Kepler satellite mission found that small planets are the most common in the galaxy. Small planets are more likely to have a “rocky” (solid) surface, which is conducive to life, at least as we know it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hey, dude, can you tell, like, how old I am? Not if I'm over 30 and tweeting, it turns out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a study of language on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, researchers in the Netherlands pitted a software program against humans in trying to guess people's ages based on their posts. The software did better than the humans, but it was accurate only in predicting the ages of younger people, usually coming within four years of a person's real age. For people over 30, all bets were off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons to like this software, however. ''Starting from older ages (around 40 to 50) the system almost always underpredicts the age,'' according to the study, which looked at the musings of 3,000 Dutch <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> users and was published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Older people also ''have a higher usage of links and hashtags, which can be associated with information sharing and impression management.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yes, teenagers and millennials do conform to some of their stereotypes. On <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>, ''younger persons talk more about themselves and use more chat language such as haha, XD,'' the researchers wrote, ''while older people use more conventional words indicating support or wishing well (e.g. wish, enjoy, thanks, take care).'' For those of you over 30: XD is a synonym for LOL; it represents a laughing face shown sideways. (I had to look it up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What good is such research? According to the study, which was written up by New Scientist, a computer program that can automatically predict people's ages ''could also be used to improve targeting of advertisements and to support fine-grained analysis of trends on the Web.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rain on Saturn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there any third grader whose favorite planet isn't Saturn? Those rings are not only fun when making models for the science fair, but also a meaningful source of water falling to the planet's surface -- a phenomenon that scientists refer to as ''ring rain.'' ''Saturn is the first planet to show significant interaction between its atmosphere and ring system,'' said James O'Donoghue of the <span class="companylink">University of Leicester</span> in England, the lead author of an article in Nature about the water falling on Saturn. Through telescope work at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the researchers confirmed that the dark bands on Saturn come from charged water particles that influence the composition and temperature of parts of its upper atmosphere. ''The main effect of ring rain is that it acts to 'quench' the ionosphere of Saturn, severely reducing the electron densities in regions in which it falls,'' Mr. O'Donoghue said in a news release. To Space.com, he put it a more user-friendly way: ''We estimate that one Olympic-sized swimming pool of water is falling on Saturn per day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wine and Climate Change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every day, it seems, global warming finds a new way to discomfit us. Researchers recently reported that rising levels of carbon dioxide could lead to more turbulence on trans-Atlantic flights . Now comes a new report that vast swaths of wine country may soon grow too warm to nurture those perfect grapes. A paper in the Proceedings of the <span class="companylink">National Academy of Sciences</span> predicted the decline of wine production in the Bordeaux and Rhone regions in France and Tuscany in Italy and noted, in scientific deadpan, that demand for wine would be likely to increase as the global population gains affluence. The good news? ''Large newly suitable areas are projected in regions of Northern Europe and western North America,'' the paper said. Or as a report in The Guardian put it, ''Bid adieu to Bordeaux, but also, quite possibly, a hello to Chateau Yellowstone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fauna</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behold: The Striped Bat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is striped like a zebra, black and white, and would fit neatly in the palm of your hand (though you might want to wear gloves). She is a new genus of bat, described in a paper in Zookeys, that was found in the Bangangai Game Preserve in South Sudan last July. At first, the bat-collecting researchers thought the unusual specimen in their net was an example of Glauconycteris, a ''poorly known bat,'' as they put it, that is also ''poorly represented in museum collections.'' (A similar-looking bat had been reported in 1939 by a researcher named Hayman working in the Belgian Congo, who had called it ''one of the most striking discoveries of recent years.'') But further analysis of the new striped bat showed that she belonged to a separate genus, by virtue of her odd appearance and the fact that ''the bat's anatomy was also distinct, featuring a larger skull, differently shaped ears, bigger teeth and longer wingtips,'' according to Wired, which compared it to ''a tiny flying bulldog.'' Her genus has been named Niumbaha, which means ''rare'' in the language of a local tribe in South Sudan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neuroscience</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clear Brains</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take this literally, not metaphorically: scientists have found a method for making brains transparent -- the tissue, that is -- which will help them study systems within a cadaver's brain without having to cut it up. The process, called Clarity, ''preserves the biochemistry of the brain so well that researchers can test it over and over again with chemicals that highlight specific structures and provide clues to past activity,'' The New York Times reported on Thursday. ''The researchers say this process may help uncover the physical underpinnings of devastating mental disorders like schizophrenia, autism, post-traumatic stress disorder and others.'' So far, the researchers, from Stanford, have been able to peer inside a whole mouse brain and part of a human brain and to highlight various networks of neurons in fluorescent colors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Thursday that they had found the most Earth-like worlds yet known in the outer cosmos, a pair of planets that appear capable of supporting life and that orbit a star 1,200 light-years from here, in the northern constellation Lyra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are the two outermost of five worlds circling a yellowish star slightly smaller and dimmer than our Sun, heretofore anonymous and now destined to be known in the cosmic history books as Kepler 62, after NASA’s Kepler spacecraft, which discovered them. These planets are roughly half again as large as Earth and are presumably balls of rock, perhaps covered by oceans with humid, cloudy skies, although that is at best a highly educated guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody will probably ever know if anything lives on these planets, and the odds are that humans will travel there only in their faster-than-light dreams, but the news has sent astronomers into heavenly raptures. William Borucki of NASA’s Ames Research Center, head of the Kepler project, described one of the new worlds as the best site for Life Out There yet found in Kepler’s four-years-and-counting search for other Earths. He treated his team to pizza and beer on his own dime to celebrate the find (this being the age of sequestration). “It’s a big deal,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looming brightly in each other’s skies, the two planets circle their star at distances of 37 million and 65 million miles, about as far apart as Mercury and Venus in our solar system. Most significantly, their orbits place them both in the “Goldilocks” zone of lukewarm temperatures suitable for liquid water, the crucial ingredient for Life as We Know It.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldilocks would be so jealous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous claims[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/science/space/scientists-are-hot-on-trail-of-exoplanets-suitable-for-life.html] of Goldilocks planets with “just so” orbits snuggled up to red dwarf stars much dimmer and cooler than the Sun have had uncertainties in the size and mass and even the existence of these worlds[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/science/space/just-right-or-nonexistent-dispute-over-goldilocks-planet-gliese-581g.html], said David Charbonneau of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span>, an exoplanet hunter and member of the Kepler team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is the first planet that ticks both boxes,” Dr. Charbonneau said, speaking of the outermost planet, Kepler 62f. “It’s the right size and the right temperature.” Kepler 62f is 40 percent bigger than Earth and smack in the middle of the habitable zone, with a 267-day year. In an interview, Mr. Borucki called it the best planet Kepler has found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its mate, known as Kepler 62e, is slightly larger — 60 percent bigger than Earth — and has a 122-day orbit, placing it on the inner edge of the Goldilocks zone. It is warmer but also probably habitable, astronomers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler 62 system resembles our own solar system, which also has two planets in the habitable zone: Earth — and Mars, which once had water and would still be habitable today if it were more massive and had been able to hang onto its primordial atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler 62 planets continue a string of breakthroughs in the last two decades in which astronomers have gone from detecting the first known planets belonging to other stars, or exoplanets, broiling globs of gas bigger than Jupiter, to being able to discern smaller and smaller more moderate orbs — iceballs like Neptune and, now, bodies only a few times the mass of Earth, known technically as super-Earths. Size matters in planetary affairs because we can’t live under the crushing pressure of gas clouds on a world like Jupiter. Life as We Know It requires solid ground and liquid water — a gentle terrestrial environment, in other words.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler 62’s newfound worlds are not quite small enough to be considered strict replicas of Earth, but the results have strengthened the already strong conviction among astronomers that the galaxy is littered with billions of Earth-size planets, perhaps as many as one per star, and that astronomers will soon find Earth 2.0, as they call it — our lost twin bathing in the rays of an alien sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Kepler and other experiments are finding planets that remind us more and more of home,” said Geoffrey Marcy, a longtime exoplanet hunter at the University of California, Berkeley, and Kepler team member. “It’s an amazing moment in science. We haven’t found Earth 2.0 yet, but we can taste it, smell it, right there on our technological fingertips.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of 60 authors, led by Mr. Borucki, reported the discovery[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:2872/content/early/2013/04/17/science.1234702] of the Kepler 62 planets on Thursday in an article published online in the journal Science and at a news conference at Ames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if that weren’t enough, a group led by Thomas Barclay of Ames and the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute also reported the discovery of a planet 1.7 times as big as Earth hovering on the inner, warmer edge of the Goldilocks zone of Kepler 69, a star almost identical to the Sun, 2,700 light-years distant. At the news conference, Dr. Barclay described the planet as perhaps a “Super-Venus.” The group’s[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:3752/0004-637X/768/2/101] paper[http://proxylibrary.hse.ru:3752/0004-637X/768/2/101] was published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in another paper submitted to The Astrophysical Journal, a group led by Lisa Kaltenegger of the <span class="companylink">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics</span> and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, in Heidelberg, Germany, took the first stab at trying to model conditions on the Kepler 62 planets. That is a tough job because the system is too far away for astronomers to measure the masses of these planets, which would allow the densities and compositions of the planets to be pinned down, or to inspect and analyze their atmospheres with telescopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scaling up from the properties of the Earth, Dr. Kaltenegger and her colleagues concluded that both of them were probably ocean worlds with humid, cloudy skies. Any life on them would probably be aquatic, she said, but “it might even be cooler life than we have here. Looking at the oceans, we find a lot of interesting life-forms there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kaltenegger said she envisioned the pair as a kind of Darwinian test tube and wondered in an e-mail if life would evolve on both worlds and, if so, “Would life evolve ‘the same’ way or would there be very different life?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is huge for the overall life-elsewhere question,” said Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> who was not part of the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Boss, a planetary expert at the <span class="companylink">Carnegie Institution of Washington</span> and a member of the Kepler team, called the new results the capstone of the Kepler mission. “I would argue,” he said in an e-mail, “that if this was all that we learned from Kepler, that the cost of this mission was justified.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in March 2009, hunts planets by staring at 150,000 stars in a patch of Milky Way sky, monitoring their brightnesses and looking for blips caused when planets pass in front of their home stars. To date the spacecraft has identified 115 planets and has a list of 2,740 other candidates. (Over all, the world’s astronomers now know of almost 1,000 exoplanets.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Kepler, which had its mission extended for four years last spring, is only now coming into its prime. A minimum of three blips is required to register a planet, and so planets like the Earth that take a year to make an orbit are only now coming into view in the Kepler data. Indeed, the new Kepler 62 planets each registered just three transits, as they are called.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a hitch, Dr. Seager and others cautioned. Because the Kepler stars are all so far away — hundreds or thousands of light-years — and the planets we want to find are so small, astronomers will never be quite completely sure what any particular planet is made of or whether anything can or does live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Kepler 62, said Natalie Batalha of <span class="companylink">San Jose State University</span>, a Kepler scientist, the astronomers had determined the composition of the new planets by comparison to three earlier objects that had similar sizes and turned out to be rocky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Mass by association,” Dr. Batalha called it in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is fine if all you want is the statistics of the cosmos. As Dr. Seager pointed out, “Kepler was not designed to tell us which planet to go live on, only how common Earth-like planets are.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AND now for some counterprogramming. You probably missed it, what with the Boston Marathon bombing, the ricin-laced letters, the fertilizer plant explosion and an entire city locked down while cops hunted the bombing suspect, but we discovered another world last week. Two, actually -- both somewhat larger than Earth, circling a star with the sadly unromantic name of Kepler 62, 1,200 light-years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These planets are not the first Earth-like bodies astronomers have discovered, but their size and position make them particularly promising candidates to have liquid water -- and with it, perhaps, some form of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their promise only adds to a mystery that's been building the further our probes and telescopes have pushed into the unknown. If Earth-like planets are relatively common, as scientists increasingly believe, then where are all the Earth-like civilizations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This mystery is known as the Fermi paradox, after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who raised it at lunch with fellow scientists in 1950. He pointed out that our Sun is a relatively young star, and billions of other suns are billions of years older. If even a tiny fraction of those suns have planets like ours, and even a tiny fraction of those planets developed life, and even a tiny fraction of those life forms achieved human-level intelligence ... well, the number of civilizations capable of interstellar communication and travel should be theoretically large enough to crowd our galaxy with signals, ships, artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In which case, Fermi asked, Where is everybody?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential answers to this question can feel as numberless as the stars themselves. (The Wikipedia entry on the Fermi paradox runs to just over 10,000 words.) But two seem particularly plausible. Perhaps life and consciousness are rare enough, mysterious enough, impossible enough, that even multiplying Earth-like worlds a billion times over would not necessarily produce either one again. Or alternatively, perhaps the gulfs between the stars are just too wide to bridge, and our current limited attempts at exploration are as far as any creatures of flesh and blood can ever hope to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first possibility obviously raises theological as well as scientific questions. In one sense, it elevates humanity, restoring us to an almost pre-Copernican position in the cosmos. At the same time, though, plenty of religious believers are untroubled (or even inspired) by the idea of extraterrestrial life, while the possibility that the cosmos might be as empty as it is vast raises troubling questions about what, exactly, its Designer had in mind. (''The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread,'' wrote the great Christian philosopher Blaise Pascal.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe, an optimistic believer might venture, the cosmos only seems empty because we haven't fulfilled our destiny and populated it. But here the second possible answer to Fermi's paradox intervenes: What if it can't be populated at all? What if our own solar system is as far as we'll ever get?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously that's not a question we're presently equipped to answer, after less than 60 years of spaceflight. But it haunts our era in subtle, unacknowledged ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a sense in which Frederick Jackson Turner's 1893 argument about how the idea of the frontier shaped American history can apply to the entire modern project. Exploration, expansion, the promise that a better life was just a long voyage away -- all of these helped fuel the sense of historical mission, the assumption of perpetual progress, which shaped and defined the modern age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go back and read the science fiction of the 1940s and '50s, and you'll be struck by the vaulting confidence that this expansion would continue upward and outward, and that a new age of exploration was just waiting to be born.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today that confidence has vanished. Our Mars rovers are impressive and our billionaires keep pouring money into private spaceflight, but neither project captures the public's imagination, and the very term ''Space Age'' seems antique. The Kepler 62 discovery might have earned more headlines at a less horrific moment, but it would have fallen out of the news soon enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's possible that we're less interested in space travel because we feel that it's a luxury good at a time when we have bigger problems here on Earth. But it's also possible that we've gradually turned inward, to our smartphone screens and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> profiles, because we know that spaceflight isn't going to get us to another world anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously exploration is not a cure for unhappiness or evil. But it can be an antidote to the mix of anxiety and exhaustion that seems to permeate the developed world these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after a week as grimly claustrophobic as this one, with its spasms of nihilistic violence, its frantic online rumor mill, its locked-down Boston streets, it seems worth hoping that the human desire for wider horizons -- for new worlds to wonder at, reach for and understand -- will someday be fulfilled again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time to get to work on that warp drive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 30 last year, after staying up late to edit the final proofs of my novel, I woke to discover it had already been adapted for television -- by CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and every other channel that had interrupted its programming to show images of a flooded New York City. Nature had taken a few liberties with the adaptation. In my novel, New York is hit by Tammy, a Category 3 hurricane; Hurricane Sandy was a Category 1. But the aftermath was largely the same: massive destruction, displacement and despair, modern catastrophe's dismal triad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't take credit for having seen it coming. The <span class="companylink">Army Corps of Engineers</span> saw it coming. A 1995 report had described, in excruciating detail, what would happen the next time a major hurricane hit the city. The report reads like dystopian fiction: a Category 4, for instance, would lead to a 15-foot storm surge, with Grand Central and Penn Station inundated, hundreds of cars submerged in the tunnels leading out of Manhattan and a regional blackout. I also relied on studies commissioned by FEMA and New York City's Office of Emergency Management, publicly available for years. Bad news all -- and, as it turned out, accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists and government officials knew what would happen when Sandy hit, just as they know what will happen in the future when larger storms come. ''We have a 100-year flood every two years now,'' Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, and though he later claimed to be exaggerating, he's not exaggerating by much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future, once an amorphous, distant plain, is rapidly articulating itself. Ever since J. G. Ballard's ''Drowned World'' (1962), if not earlier, novelists have been imagining how we will live in an age of environmental ruin. In Kim Stanley Robinson's ''Red Mars'' (1993), a scarcity of natural resources leads to world war; in ''A Friend of the Earth'' (2000), T. Coraghessan Boyle describes a future in which the biosphere has collapsed, most mammals are extinct and Brazil is a desert. Dystopian novels about environmental apocalypses tend to contain a warning: this is the hell we will inherit if we don't change our behavior, quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that view is obsolete. We already know it's too late to reverse the planet's transformation, and we know what is going to happen next -- namely more of the same, just worse: superstorms, super-droughts, super-pandemics, massive population displacement, water scarcity, desertification and all the rest. The grim details can be found in any of the hundreds of nonfiction polemics published on the subject every year, books with titles like ''Overheated'' and ''Hot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">E. M. Forster, in his 1909 dystopian short story ''The Machine Stops,'' anticipated the Internet and its sovereignty over our minds; Jules Verne foresaw the Apollo space program with an uncanny degree of precision; and Mark Twain, in a story called ''From The London Times of 1904,'' invented a device called the telelectroscope, which is essentially Skype. But today, perhaps for the first time in history, our scientists' predictions have outpaced the creative powers of our novelists. Even as a form, the dystopian novel seems quaint -- our worst fears are already upon us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, a truly dystopian work of fiction cannot rely on fantasy, but must instead engage more scrupulously with reality. This is one reason Ian McEwan's ''Solar,'' one of the few recent novels that speak eloquently, and with the appropriate sense of absurdity, about man's efforts to reverse climate change, is set in the present and recent past. The reality is worse than anyone has imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for novelists is coming from another flank. Nonfiction writers, borrowing freely from the novelist's bag of tricks but often with greater dexterity, seem better equipped to write about environmental collapse. Timothy Egan's ''Worst Hard Time,'' a historical account of the Dust Bowl, reads like a thriller, and predicts that even harder times will come soon. Ron Rosenbaum's ''How the End Begins'' has the force of an apocalyptic horror novel -- only everything in it is real. The best example in recent years is ''The World Without Us,'' by Alan Weisman, a work of speculative fiction disguised as a scientific study, which imagines what would happen to the planet should human beings suddenly vanish. The answer: Earth would be just fine. The globe, after all, has seen worse. It's the globe's human population that's in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is the poor novelist to do about all this, if anything? His concern, as Saul Bellow put it, is ''man's heart,'' and he is not necessarily adept at stochastic models, Poisson curves or quantile regression charts. Just as elected politicians are generally ill-suited to respond to long-term, slow-to-develop global crises, novelists tend to be ill-suited to address complex scientific phenomena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly the novelist has no obligation to write about climate change. But hasn't man's heart changed too? It's true every generation believes it's the last, a convenient sentiment that gives urgency and meaning to our brief time on earth. It is safe to say, however, that there has never been a generation in the history of human civilization with more access to bad news than ours. And the news is not all climate-related. The latest issues of periodicals like Emerging Infectious Diseases, Food Safety Magazine and the International Journal of Cyber Warfare and Terrorism are just a few keystrokes away, as are maps of the world's remaining nuclear warheads, the F.B.I.'s list of most wanted fugitives and the latest seismic data about the Yellowstone supervolcano. (If you don't know about the Yellowstone supervolcano, just <span class="companylink">Google</span> ''Yellowstone supervolcano human extinction.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We know that certain milestones -- the collapse of the euro, peak oil and a megathrust earthquake that demolishes Seattle -- will come to pass. We just don't know when. There is a huge volcano on La Palma, one of the Canary Islands; scientists claim that the next time it erupts, half a trillion tons of rock will slide into the ocean, triggering the largest tsunami in recorded history, one that will make landfall, eight hours later, on the Atlantic Seaboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if you're not the kind of person who compulsively searches ''mad cow outbreak'' or subscribes to the National Weather Service's ''Active Alerts,'' the bad news is unrelenting. No Ebola flare-up or near-miss asteroid goes unpublicized. The Internet echoes the information until it suffocates everything else. In ''Future Shock,'' published more than 40 years ago, Alvin Toffler described this condition as ''information overload.'' We're information-saturated, and most of the information is ominous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Novelists may be powerless to change this terrifying new world, but they can make a greater effort to understand how it is changing us. Isn't this, after all, why we read novels -- to see ourselves more clearly? A great novel holds a mirror to our secret desires and fears; it allows us to confront our long-term crises. It helps us to understand how the vast, complex problems of our time connect with our private inner lives. Novelists therefore have an obligation to pose the intimate questions: How does all this bad news affect our relationships with our loved ones, our hopes for the future, the way we go about our daily lives? Do we ignore it, turn cynical, or become overwhelmed by dread? What is all this information doing to our minds? What is it doing to our hearts?</p>
<p>Nathaniel Rich is the author of the novels ''The Mayor's Tongue'' and, most recently, ''Odds Against Tomorrow.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after a week as grimly claustrophobic as this one, with its spasms of nihilistic violence, its frantic online rumor mill, its locked-down Boston streets, it seems worth hoping that the human desire for wider horizons — for new worlds to wonder at, reach for and understand — will someday be fulfilled again.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HAGUE — On Monday many people are celebrating Earth Day by admiring the beauty of our planet and by calling attention to the environmental dangers it faces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the focus is on the planet, economists are warning that carbon emissions could cause grave damage to something else green and dear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of carbon-based investments — many traded publicly — could implode once governments start seriously curbing emissions, bursting what some have dubbed “the carbon bubble.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released by the&nbsp;Carbon Tracker Initiative[http://www.carbontracker.org/] and the London School of Economics[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Home.aspx] on Friday shows that 60 to 80 percent of coal, oil and gas reserves held by the top 200 oil, gas and mining companies listed on the world’s stock exchanges could be considered unburnable and therefore far less valuable than thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Smart investors can already see that most fossil fuel reserves are essentially unburnable because of the need to reduce emissions in line with the global agreement by governments to avoid global warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius,” said Nicholas Stern, the chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if current trends continue, an additional $6 trillion will be spent developing fossil fuels in the next decade, while the world’s global carbon budget — the amount of carbon it is safe to burn — remains limited and fixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authors of Unburnable Carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets[http://carbontracker.live.kiln.it/Unburnable-Carbon-2-Web-Version.pdf] propose that a carbon budget of 900 gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere from now to mid-century would give an 80 percent chance of 2-degree warming. And unless carbon capture and storage technology changes drastically, say the researchers, its use will not cause the planet’s carbon budget to change significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers found that the top oil and gas and mining companies are already sitting on $4 trillion of fossil fuel. And though much of the reserves cannot be used if global warming measures are enacted, the markets continue to value the energy assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year alone the companies invested $674 billion in fossil fuel reserves exploration, some of which was undertaken in environmentally sensitive areas[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/energy-environment/rivals-watch-travails-of-shell-arctic-drilling.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This interactive map[http://www.carbontracker.org/unburnable-carbon-interactive] shows where energy reserves are traded around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pretending business models reliant on more carbon emissions fit with increasing carbon constraints is the equivalent of the emperor’s new clothes,” said James Leaton the research director at Carbon Tracker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with Bill McKibben of <span class="companylink">350.org</span>, who is leading a successful divestment campaign at American colleges[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/energy-environment/to-fight-climate-change-college-students-take-aim-at-the-endowment-portfolio.html], Mr. Leaton wrote in an op-ed in The Guardian:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six-trillion-dollar bet is that this calculation remains entirely theoretical, and that fossil-fuel companies will be allowed to keep pumping up the carbon bubble by investing more cash to turn resources into reserves, and continue booking them at full value, assuming zero risk of devaluation. It’s a bet that effectively says to government: “Nah, we don’t believe a word you say. We think you’ll do nothing about climate change for decades.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News organizations in Britain made the link between a carbon bubble and further troubles for financial markets, with The Guardian running the report on its front page[http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/19/carbon-bubble-financial-crash-crisis]. Of course, not everyone is convinced of the financial danger that would be present only if the world’s governments actually got serious about curbing carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim Worstall, a fellow with the free-market <span class="companylink">Adam Smith Institute</span> in London, charged on Forbes.com that among numerous, serious errors, the environmentally “safe” carbon budget allocated by the report is too low[http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/04/19/lord-sterns-unburnable-carbon-bubble-from-not-quite-right-to-nonsense/], which leads to a low estimate on the value of fossil fuel reserves on companies’ books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report is not the first to warn of a “carbon bubble.” In January, a group of investors, environmentalists and businesspeople wrote an open letter[http://www.climatechangecapital.com/media/256968/letter%20to%20bank%20of%20england%20financial%20policy%20committee%20-%2019th%20january%202012%20-%20final.pdf] to the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England warning against heavy investments in carbon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives[http://www.policyalternatives.ca/] released its report on Canada’s “stranded” fossil fuel assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What do you say? Is talk of a “carbon bubble” actually wishful thinking from environmentalists? Is there any break on the amount of carbon humankind will use, other than the amount of reserves it can exploit? Is the L.S.E. report useful?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're up in space -- weightless -- with a wet washcloth. What will happen when you wring it out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even on Friday, when everyone was riveted to the manhunt in Boston, an online video from the International Space Station about that question was a suspenseful and intriguing diversion. What happened to the water in microgravity turned out to be ''much more interesting than what happens here on earth,'' as The Los Angeles Times put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before we give you the answer, here's the context: Canada's equivalent of NASA held a contest for schoolchildren, asking them to design a simple experiment that the Canadian astronaut aboard the space station could perform using particular household items, office supplies and the like. The list of nearly 50 items included dental floss, nylon running shorts, ketchup, mustard and a magnifying glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two 10th-grade girls from Nova Scotia, together with their science teacher, came up with the wet washcloth idea, chosen from nearly 100 entries. So last Tuesday, the commander of the space station, Chris Hadfield, a veteran spacewalker, recorded a video in which, with a microphone bobbing near his mouth, he unfurled a white washcloth, squirted drinking water onto it, then twisted the saturated cloth. In what looked like a magic trick, the water began surrounding the washcloth in a thick layer, then migrated outward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's becoming a tube of water,'' Commander Hadfield said, staring intently at the cloth over his signature mustache. ''It wrings out of the cloth onto my hands.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the surface tension of the water, he explained, the fluid ran along the exterior of the fabric and onto him, where it stuck, ''almost like you had Jell-O on your hand.'' He wiped his wet hands and left the washcloth, still twisted, dangling in place. ''Great experiment, worked perfectly,'' he said. The 10th graders had predicted the outcome spot on. ''Their hypothesis that the water would not drip in microgravity but rather remain on the washcloth was proven correct,'' as the <span class="companylink">Canadian Space Agency</span> put it in a news release. ''In the absence of gravity to pull the water down, it took a shake or a quick squeeze from Commander Hadfield for the washcloth to release the water.'' Or, as one person commented on the video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, ''Everything is cooler in space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veterinary Medicine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ursine Neurosurgery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Laos, an Asiatic black bear with hydrocephalus -- water on the brain, which causes fierce headaches -- underwent laparoscopic surgery, becoming the first bear ever to have a brain operation, National Geographic reported. ''Rescued as a cub, Champa stood out from the start,'' the magazine said. ''She had a protruding forehead and had trouble socializing with the other bears at the sanctuary. Over time, her growth slowed, her behavior became more erratic, and her vision faded.'' Euthanizing Champa was not considered an option in the largely Buddhist country, so a British veterinary surgeon, Romain Pizzi, who describes his specialty as ''minimally invasive 'keyhole' surgery of wildlife,'' operated on her, just as he has done on seals, reindeer and jaguars. Six weeks post-op, Champa looked perkier, her caretakers said; she had gained weight and grown chummier with other bears.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warding Off Breast Cancer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has long been a thorny topic: Should healthy women take tamoxifen and raloxifene, powerful drugs that can reduce their risk of breast cancer but can also cause life-threatening strokes and blood clots? Some resolution arrived last week, when the <span class="companylink">United States Preventive Services Task Force</span> -- a gold standard among medical experts -- recommended that doctors offer to prescribe the drugs for women with higher than average risk of breast cancer and low risks of blood clots and strokes. The drugs work by blocking the effects of estrogen in breast tissue, where it can stimulate the growth of some tumors. ''These medicines may have benefits for women who are at increased risk of breast cancer and at low risk for harms from the medicines,'' the task force said in a fact sheet, but ''women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer should not use tamoxifen or raloxifene to reduce their risk for breast cancer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Infant Development</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Do Babies Know?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five-month-old infants can't tell you what they are seeing and thinking (though their mothers can, of course). But if you attach electrode caps to their heads -- which is harmless, though it looks disturbing -- you can get a glimpse of their brain activity. A French neuroscientist did this, plopping infants in their parents' laps and measuring the neural patterns generated when the babies viewed a face flashed on a screen. In results that seem oddly reassuring, the babies showed the same brain reactions that adults do -- a ''two-phase pattern that would indicate consciousness,'' as the Web site LiveScience put it -- but it took them longer to get there. ''In 5-month-olds, it took 1.3 seconds for the second flurry of brain activity to show up,'' LiveScience noted. ''In adults, the timing is closer to three-tenths of a second.'' The small study, which was published in Science, adds weight to the argument that very young infants are conscious of their surroundings, meaning that their reactions are not just reflexive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two bits of seismic activity news came up last week -- totally separate, both startling. One was that the horrific fertilizer plant explosion in West, Tex., which caused at least 14 deaths and left a wide swath of devastation, was so powerful that the <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span> registered it as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake. And the seismic impact of Hurricane Sandy last October may have been the same or larger: Keith D. Koper, a geophysicist at the University of Utah, and a colleague reported that waves pounding the seafloor generated ''microseisms'' that were picked up around the country. ''There is no magnitude scale for the microseisms generated by Sandy, but Koper says they range from roughly 2 to 3 on a quake magnitude scale,'' ScienceDaily, a news Web site, reported. ''The conversion is difficult because earthquakes pack a quick punch, while storms unleash their energy for many hours.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hear my voice -- Alexander Graham Bell,'' the father of the telephone said on April 15, 1885, enunciating carefully, his voice recorded on a wax-and-cardboard disc at an experimental sound laboratory he ran in Washington. At the time, Bell was trying feverishly to develop audio technology that would best his archrival, Thomas Edison, who had recorded ''Mary Had a Little Lamb'' on embossed foil in 1877, according to the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian Institution</span>, which owns a collection of Bell's artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, for the first time, anyone with an Internet connection could hear Bell's voice, which had been lost to posterity. In the 1880s, Bell and his colleagues had used everything from ''metal, wax, glass, paper, plastic, foil and cardboard'' to record sound and embed it on discs or cylinders, but modern audiologists had been unable to play them back. (The work came after Bell's development of the telephone: the ephemeral and unrecorded plea ''Mr. Watson, come here -- I want to see you'' was made in 1876.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puzzled by the mute Bell discs, a curator from the <span class="companylink">National Museum of American History</span> reached out to a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Carl Haber, who had ''succeeded in extracting sound from early recordings made in Paris in 1860,'' according to the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> account. ''He and his team created high-resolution optical scans converted by computer into an audio file.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They brought in a specialist from the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span>, as well as Patrick Feaster, a sound historian at Indiana University. Until recently, Dr. Feaster wrote in The Atlantic, little recorded sound had survived from before Edison introduced his Perfected Phonograph in 1888; a breakthrough came in 2008, when a collaboration called First Sounds, which included Dr. Haber and Dr. Feaster, was able to restore a French recording from 1860, a 10-second snippet of ''Au Clair de la Lune'' made on a phonautogram.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 20, 2012, the team working on the 1885 Bell recording ''was transfixed as it listened to the inventor himself,'' Charlotte Gray, a Bell biographer, wrote in <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> magazine. Ms. Gray had wondered if Bell, who was born in Scotland but had lived in England, Canada and the United States, would have a Scottish burr. The answer was no, but ''the intonation of the British Isles was unmistakable in Bell's speech,'' she wrote. ''The voice is vigorous and forthright.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, scientists are worried about the sequester, but some are at the mercy of something more mercurial than Congress: Somali pirates, who have effectively shut down fieldwork in the erratic patch of Indian Ocean they trawl. ''There's been no data coming out of this area for years. Zero,'' Tim White, a Berkeley anthropologist whose work on hominid fossils in East Africa has been thwarted, said in an interview with National Geographic. The pirates of Somalia have created a ''data hole'' for scientists in ''subjects as diverse as plate tectonics, plankton evolution, oceanography, and climate change,'' the magazine said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Painkillers and Marathoners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although lots of marathon runners take over-the-counter analgesics before they race, trying to keep the pain at a dull roar, they could actually be making things worse for themselves, the journal BMJ Open said. In a study of 4,000 runners from the Bonn Marathon in Germany in 2010, researchers found that ''runners who used painkillers had a 13 percent increased risk of 'adverse events' including muscle cramps and intestinal cramps,'' The Guardian reported. Apparently the painkillers people took -- which included ibuprofen and aspirin, as well as an anti-inflammatory called diclofenac -- interfered with the way the body contracts and relaxes muscle tissue. The higher the doses, the greater the risk of problems. All in all, ''analgesics taken prophylactically before racing do not prevent pain,'' the study said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hear my voice — Alexander Graham Bell,” the father of the telephone said on April 15, 1885, enunciating carefully, his voice recorded on a wax-and-cardboard disc at an experimental sound laboratory he ran in Washington. At the time, Bell was trying feverishly to develop audio technology that would best his archrival, Thomas Edison, who had recorded “Mary Had a Little Lamb” on embossed foil in 1877, according to the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian Institution</span>, which owns a collection of Bell’s artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, for the first time, anyone with an Internet connection could hear Bell’s voice[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/We-Had-No-Idea-What-Alexander-Graham-Bell-Sounded-Like-Until-Now-204137471.html], which had been lost to posterity. In the 1880s, Bell and his colleagues had used everything from “metal, wax, glass, paper, plastic, foil and cardboard” to record sound and embed it on discs or cylinders, but modern audiologists had been unable to play them back. (The work came after Bell’s development of the telephone: the ephemeral and unrecorded plea “Mr. Watson, come here — I want to see you” was made in 1876.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puzzled by the mute Bell discs, a curator from the <span class="companylink">National Museum of American History</span> reached out to a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Carl Haber, who had “succeeded in extracting sound from early recordings made in Paris in 1860,” according to the <span class="companylink">Smithsonian</span> account. “He and his team created high-resolution optical scans converted by computer into an audio file.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They brought in a specialist from the <span class="companylink">Library of Congress</span>, as well as Patrick Feaster, a sound historian at Indiana University. Until recently, Dr. Feaster wrote in The Atlantic[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/We-Had-No-Idea-What-Alexander-Graham-Bell-Sounded-Like-Until-Now-204137471.html], little recorded sound had survived from before Edison introduced his Perfected Phonograph [http://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/30/3032/8MVBF00Z/posters/thomas-edison-speaking-through-his-perfected-phonograph.jpg]in 1888; a breakthrough came in 2008, when a collaboration called First Sounds, which included Dr. Haber and Dr. Feaster, was able to restore a French recording from 1860, a 10-second snippet of “Au Clair de la Lune” made on a phonautogram.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 20, 2012, the team working on the 1885 Bell recording “was transfixed as it listened to the inventor himself,” Charlotte Gray, a Bell biographer, wrote in Smithsonian magazine[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/We-Had-No-Idea-What-Alexander-Graham-Bell-Sounded-Like-Until-Now-204137471.html]. Ms. Gray had wondered if Bell, who was born in Scotland but had lived in England, Canada and the United States, would have a Scottish burr. The answer was no, but “the intonation of the British Isles was unmistakable in Bell’s speech,” she wrote. “The voice is vigorous and forthright.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TIME REBORN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Lee Smolin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 319 pp. <span class="companylink">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</span>. $28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the more fanciful conceptions of nature, the British physicist and philosopher Julian Barbour proposed that the world is just a ''heap of moments,'' each an instant of frozen time. There is no order to the moments, no sequence, no cause-and-effect relationship. We exist only from moment to moment. If we experience time passing, it's because this particular moment has memories of another moment woven into it. Some moments are interesting: they contain complexity, stars and planets, life. Others are boring: they contain only energy, or perhaps nothing at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his new book, ''Time Reborn,'' Lee Smolin, a physicist and author of ''The Life of the Cosmos'' (1997) and ''The Trouble With Physics'' (2006), recounts Barbour's cosmology with some admiration and then goes on to offer even more radical ideas of his own. Smolin argues that the Now has been taken out of physics, and it is time to put it back in. For example, Smolin says that Newtonian physics expresses the notion that the future is determined by the past and so, in a sense, the future already exists. He rightly remarks that Einsteinian physics frames time as a relative concept in which the line between past and future varies with the observer. To remedy these perceived problems, he suggests major structural revisions to the two fundamental pillars of modern physics, relativity and quantum mechanics. His book, a mix of science, philosophy and science fiction, is at once entertaining, thought-provoking, fabulously ambitious and fabulously speculative. Although full of wonderful metaphors and analogies, it may prove heavy sledding for many readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twentieth-century physics has brought us two kinds of strangeness: strange things we more or less understand, and strange things we do not understand. The first category includes relativity and quantum mechanics. Relativity reveals that time is not absolute. Clocks in relative motion to each other tick at different rates. We don't notice relativity in daily life because the relative speed must be close to the speed of light before the effects are significant. Quantum mechanics presents a probabilistic picture of reality; subatomic particles act as if they occupy many places at once, and their locations can be described only in terms of probabilities. Although we can make accurate predictions about the average behavior of a large number of subatomic particles, we cannot predict the behavior of a single subatomic particle, or even a single atom. We don't feel quantum mechanics because its effects are significant only in the tiny realm of the atom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The category of strange things we do not understand includes the origin of the universe and the nature of the ''dark energy'' that pervades the cosmos. Over the last 40 years, physicists have realized that various universal parameters, like the mass of the electron (a type of subatomic particle) and the strength of the nuclear force (the force that holds the subatomic particles together within the centers of atoms), appear to be precisely calibrated. That is, if these parameters were a little larger or a little smaller than they actually are, the complex molecules needed for life could never have formed. Presumably, the values of these parameters were set at the origin of the universe. Fifteen years ago, astronomers discovered a previously unknown and still unexplained cosmic energy that fills the universe and acts as an antigravity-like force, pushing the galaxies apart. The density of this dark energy also appears to be extraordinarily fine-tuned. A little smaller or a little larger, and the life-giving stars would never have formed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The haunting question is why these fundamental parameters lie in the narrow range required by life. What determined their values? One explanation offered by physicists, called the ''anthropic principle,'' is that there are, in fact, a great many universes, with widely varying properties and parameters. In most other universes, the strength of the nuclear force, the density of the dark energy and so on are much different than in ours. Those universes would be lifeless and barren. By definition, we live in one of the universes with parameters that allow life, because otherwise we would not be here to ask the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smolin has his own theory to explain why we live in a life-supporting universe, which he calls ''cosmological natural selection.'' He proposes that new universes are spawned at the centers of black holes. As in biological natural selection, those universes with the right parameters for producing new black holes have descendants; those that do not disappear. What's more, it turns out that some of the conditions needed to form black holes, such as the right parameters to form stars, are the same as those needed for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its appeal, there are several problems with Smolin's theory. First, there is no evidence that new universes are created at the centers of black holes. Second, even if such evidence existed, why would the parameters of a universe so created bear any resemblance to the parameters of its parent universe, as required by the theory? If the parameters differ by more than a little, the new universe would not have ''survivable'' characteristics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cosmological natural selection does have one feature that relates to Smolin's dissatisfaction with the relativity of time. The succession of parent and descendant universes necessarily unfolds in time, and Smolin believes that this is ''real'' time (as opposed to what he calls the ''unreal'' and ''inessential'' conceptions of time in traditional physics).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He goes on to propose a variety of revolutionary ideas to codify further his notion of ''real time.'' In one, he suggests that every atom in the universe is causally connected to every other atom in the universe, no matter how many light-years away. According to his notion, the failure of standard quantum mechanics to predict the behavior of individual atoms arises from the fact that it does not take into account the vast numbers of interconnections extending across the universe. Furthermore, this picture of the cosmos requires an absolute time (in violation of relativity), which he calls ''preferred global time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Smolin's most astonishing ideas is something he calls the ''principle of precedence,'' that repeated measurements of a particular phenomenon yield the same outcomes not because the phenomenon is subject to a law of nature but simply because the phenomenon has occurred in the past. ''Such a principle,'' Smolin writes, ''would explain all the instances in which determinism by laws work but without forbidding new measurements to yield new outcomes, not predictable from knowledge of the past.'' In Smolin's view such unconstrained outcomes are necessary for ''real'' time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting aside the sensational ideas proposed in ''Time Reborn,'' it is a triumph of modern physics that we are even asking such questions as what determined the initial conditions of the universe. In previous centuries, these conditions were either accepted as given or attributed to the handiwork of the gods. A triumph, and also possibly a defeat. For if we must appeal to the existence of other universes -- unknown and unknowable -- to explain our universe, then science has progressed into a cul-de-sac with no scientific escape.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new kid has arrived on the science journalism block, a monthly magazine named Nautilus: Science Connected. Its first issue, which appeared online on April 29, focuses on a single theme: what does or does not make the human race special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It uses as an epigraph a 1995 statement from Stephen Hawking, the English physicist and man about the universe: ''The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides a couple of dozen articles on that theme, on topics from astronomy to robotics to neuroscience, there is a lineup of blogs, interviews and even a piece of fiction, about a future in which nobody reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the extras is an entertaining interview with Robert A.F. Thurman, the Buddhist scholar and father of Uma, who says he loves Dr. Hawking's comment. ''That's a key the Buddhist found long ago,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Steele, the founder, publisher and editorial director of the magazine -- which was started with a grant from the <span class="companylink">John Templeton Foundation</span> -- described his vision of it as ''a New Yorker version of Scientific American.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future issues will each be devoted to a single topic -- ''uncertainty,'' ''secrets'' -- in all its cosmic ramifications. It is the only science magazine I know that lists a pair of ''contract philosophers'' on its masthead. The editor in chief, Michael Segal, has a doctorate in electrical engineering and was an editor at Nature Nanotechnology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magazine will not come out all at once, but in online ''chapters'' each Thursday. Physically, it is to appear quarterly; subscriptions are $49 a year; Mr. Steele hopes for an initial base of 5,000 subscribers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new kid has arrived on the science journalism block, a monthly magazine named Nautilus: Science Connected[http://nautil.us/]. Its first issue, which appeared online on April 29, focuses on a single theme: what does or does not make the human race special.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It uses as an epigraph a 1995 statement from Stephen Hawking, the English physicist and man about the universe: “The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides a couple of dozen articles on that theme, on topics from astronomy to robotics to neuroscience, there is a lineup of blogs, interviews and even a piece of fiction, about a future in which nobody reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the extras is an entertaining interview with Robert A.F. Thurman[http://nautil.us/issue/1/what-makes-you-so-special/what-would-buddha-say], the Buddhist scholar and father of Uma, who says he loves Dr. Hawking’s comment. “That’s a key the Buddhist found long ago,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Steele, the founder, publisher and editorial director of the magazine — which was started with a grant from the <span class="companylink">John Templeton Foundation</span> — described his vision of it as “a New Yorker version of Scientific American.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future issues will each be devoted to a single topic — “uncertainty,” “secrets” — in all its cosmic ramifications. It is the only science magazine I know that lists a pair of “contract philosophers” on its masthead. The editor in chief, Michael Segal, has a doctorate in electrical engineering and was an editor at Nature Nanotechnology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The magazine will not come out all at once, but in online “chapters” each Thursday. Physically, it is to appear quarterly; subscriptions are $49 a year; Mr. Steele hopes for an initial base of 5,000 subscribers. A few copies of an abridged version of the first issue have been produced: Its 44 thick, color pages have the luxurious production values of a corporate report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will not come as news that Mr. Steele faces odds at least as daunting as any prospective gene mapper or planet explorer. Magazines and newspapers, after all, are supposed to be going the way of buggy-whip factories. Science journalism, in particular, is a field littered with corpses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EQUILATERAL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Ken Kalfus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illustrated. 207 pp. Bloomsbury. $24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set in the scorching heat of the Egyptian desert at the end of the 19th century, Ken Kalfus’s new novel follows a fictional British astronomer’s attempt to make contact with Mars. Hundreds of thousands of men are digging the gigantic equilateral triangle with which Sanford Thayer intends to send a signal to his fellow astronomers on the red planet. Once finished, each side will consist of a paved trench more than 300 miles long and exactly one seventy-third of Earth’s circumference. The trenches, five miles wide, are deep enough to be filled with a 12-inch layer of petroleum that will flow from 309 taps connected to a pipeline. The huge black triangle set against the white desert sand will prove the existence of terrestrial intelligence to the Martians, Thayer argues, because the equal-sided triangle is part of the two planets’ “shared knowledge of trigonometry.” The equilateral triangle is, he believes, the “basis for all human art and construction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thayer and his crew are in a race against time. As Earth and Mars move closer to each other in their orbital dance — half a million miles each day — a deadline is approaching. According to Thayer’s calculations, the giant triangle needs to be finished by June 17, 1894, when Earth will be at its most advantageously visible from Mars. That night Thayer and his team will light the petroleum, creating a huge flare that will “petition for man’s membership in the fraternity of planetary civilizations.” Thayer is utterly convinced that his audacious enterprise will attract the attention and admiration of his distant, alien colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In “Equilateral,” Kalfus, who was a National Book Award finalist for his previous novel, “A Disorder Peculiar to the Country,” takes as his starting point the true story of late-19th-century astronomers who believed they had discovered elaborate artificial canal systems on Mars. Among them was the American Percival Lowell, who insisted that he had seen irrigation channels and seasonal color changes like the greening of fields. This was enough to convince him that the red planet was inhabited by intelligent beings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kalfus cleverly moves from these historical facts to Thayer’s brazen invented project, using them as steppingstones to tell the story of a spectacularly bold, obsessive and outrageously arrogant man. Thayer believes in the progress of science and mankind. Inspired by Darwin’s “Origin of Species,” he expects planets to evolve just as plants and animals do. Since Mars is an older planet than Earth, Thayer says, he hopes to learn from the Martians how to “assemble the social, spiritual and material resources necessary to survive a dehydrating planet.” But while his great triangle in the desert has been conceived to “benefit the whole of humanity,” regardless of nation and religion, it’s been financed by the so-called Mars Concession, an international consortium of private shareholders and governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are problems. Thayer’s workers are threatening to strike, limestone impedes the progress of the digging, men are killed, a factory manufacturing pitch for the trenches is seriously damaged, creating further delays. And Thayer himself is increasingly debilitated by fevers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is another triangle in this story, which may take the idea a little too literally — one involving Thayer; his loyal and smart secretary, Miss Keaton; and an alluring Arab servant girl who speaks no English. Miss Keaton is an accomplished astronomer herself; she also runs much of the operation in the desert. She and Thayer have in the past been more than just colleagues, but as he falls deeper into the delirium caused by his illness, he becomes strangely — elusively, ultimately unconvincingly — attracted to the subservient servant girl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">t just over 200 pages, “Equilateral” sometimes feels too slender, its characters one-dimensional, leaving the reader with little emotional investment in Thayer and his companions. But Kalfus writes so well that his storytelling carries us along. Only rarely does his language become overdrawn, as when he points out the “lush lactic wash of the Milky Way” or notes that the servant girl is as “supple as a cat and as fecund as the Nile.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the end, though, Kalfus redeems “Equilateral” with some fine twists as the narrative becomes darker and more complex, evolving into a more intricate fable, an exploration of man’s hubris. As the world awaits word from the Martians, Thayer’s dream of intergalactic communication and the progress of science turns into an economic equation. A majestic customs house, 200 feet high and made of the finest Portland stone, adorned with soaring columns, is erected at one of the corners of the gigantic triangle, a fitting symbol of what this enterprise is really about: trade, exploitation, colonialism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it is announced that Herr Krupp, Mr. Rockefeller and Baron Rothschild are expected to join the officials assembled in the desert, it becomes clear that Thayer has served his purpose. From now on, “men of business will have to take center stage.” Miss Keaton’s protest that “the Equilateral is meant to serve humanity” is the last reminder of what it had once signified. Meanwhile the Concession is waiting to cash in on its “monopoly on trade with Mars.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two astronauts aboard the International Space Station conducted a hastily arranged spacewalk on Saturday to look for the source of a worrisome leak that had forced the shutdown of one of the eight power systems that provide electricity to the orbiting laboratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two astronauts, Thomas H. Marshburn and Christopher Cassidy, both American, spent 5 ½ hours outside the space station. They were unable to locate the source of the leak, but did install a new pump, which appeared to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new pump started up normally, and with the two astronauts looking for escaping crystals of ammonia coolant, there were no signs of the leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not seeing anything,'' Dr. Marshburn reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure in the coolant loop was also holding, another indicator that the problem had been resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, astronauts spotted a stream of frozen flakes emanating from one of the station's trusses. From videos, engineers concluded that the source of the leaks was a pump that pushes ammonia coolant to regulate temperatures on one of the eight expansive solar arrays, which provide electricity to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each array has an independent cooling loop, and the leak did not have an immediate impact on the day-to-day operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said there was no danger to the six-member crew. But they worried that if a problem developed with a second cooling loop, the station might have had to cut back on its power consumption, limiting science experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has tussled with coolant leaks previously and last November, two other astronauts took a spacewalk to fix a leak in the same general area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been something that has been troubling us for some time,'' Joel Montalbano, the deputy space station program manager, said at a news conference after the spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balky loop had been losing coolant at a rate of five pounds per year, but on Thursday, that rate jumped to five pounds per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three of the crew members, including Dr. Marshburn, scheduled to head back to Earth on Monday, NASA decided it would be prudent to repair the leak sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than 48 hours, plans for the spacewalk and the repairs were put together. At 8:44 a.m. Eastern time on Saturday, Dr. Marshburn and Mr. Cassidy switched on the power to their spacesuits, marking the start of the spacewalk. When they reached the site of the suspected leak, at the far left end of the space station, they were not able to spot evidence of it. Even after removing the pump, they did not see much unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks really, really clean,'' Dr. Marshburn said. ''Surprisingly so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers thought the leak could be inside the pump and decided that a new one should be installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marshburn and Mr. Cassidy did take a moment to admire the view as they passed over the southern end of Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Did you see the moon?'' Dr. Marshburn asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did, oh my God!'' Mr. Cassidy replied. ''Burn that in your memory!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the 168th spacewalk related to construction or maintenance of the space station since the first piece of the space complex was launched in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're happy, we're very happy,'' Mr. Montalbano said after the repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warned that it would be weeks or months before engineers were confident that the problem would not recur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,'' Mr. Montalbano said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new pump started up normally, and with the two astronauts looking for escaping crystals of ammonia coolant, there were no signs of the leak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not seeing anything,” Dr. Marshburn reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressure in the coolant loop was also holding, another indicator that the problem had been resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, astronauts spotted a stream of frozen flakes emanating from one of the station’s trusses. From videos, engineers concluded that the source of the leaks was a pump that pushes ammonia coolant to regulate temperatures on one of the eight expansive solar arrays, which provide electricity to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each array has an independent cooling loop, and the leak did not have an immediate impact on the day-to-day operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said there was no danger to the six-member crew. But they worried that if a problem developed with a second cooling loop, the station might have had to cut back on its power consumption, limiting science experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has tussled with coolant leaks previously and last November, two other astronauts took a spacewalk to fix a leak in the same general area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This has been something that has been troubling us for some time,” Joel Montalbano, the deputy space station program manager, said at a news conference after the spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balky loop had been losing coolant at a rate of five pounds per year, but on Thursday, that rate jumped to five pounds per day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three of the crew members, including Dr. Marshburn, scheduled to head back to Earth on Monday, NASA decided it would be prudent to repair the leak sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less than 48 hours, plans for the spacewalk and the repairs were put together. At 8:44 a.m. Eastern time on Saturday, Dr. Marshburn and Mr. Cassidy switched on the power to their spacesuits, marking the start of the spacewalk. When they reached the site of the suspected leak, at the far left end of the space station, they were not able to spot evidence of it. Even after removing the pump, they did not see much unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It looks really, really clean,” Dr. Marshburn said. “Surprisingly so.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA engineers thought the leak could be inside the pump and decided that a new one should be installed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Marshburn and Mr. Cassidy did take a moment to admire the view as they passed over the southern end of Africa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Did you see the moon?” Dr. Marshburn asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I did, oh my God!” Mr. Cassidy replied. “Burn that in your memory!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the 168th spacewalk related to construction or maintenance of the space station since the first piece of the space complex was launched in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re happy, we’re very happy,” Mr. Montalbano said after the repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He warned that it would be weeks or months before engineers were confident that the problem would not recur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Obviously, the longer you go, the more confidence you get,” Mr. Montalbano said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who has documented his five months in charge of the International Space Station in great detail in Twitter photographs[https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield] and YouTube videos[http://www.youtube.com/user/canadianspaceagency/videos?view=0], celebrated his last day aboard the craft by releasing an elaborately produced cover version[http://youtu.be/KaOC9danxNo] of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the many admirers of the astronaut’s remarkable music video, which was viewed more than a million times in the 18 hours after it was posted on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, were the editors of Mr. Bowie’s official <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page, who praised the cover as[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151372549242665&amp;l=8f3f814a17] “possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most 53-year-old Bowie fans who record cover versions of his hits around the office in their spare time, Mr. Hadfield, who is scheduled to return to Earth on Monday in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, had the benefit of shooting in a zero-gravity work station with stunning views and help from a musician who once toured with Mr. Bowie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian musician Emm Gryner, who sang with Mr. Bowie in 2000, explained in a post on her blog[http://emmgryner.com/emmbassy/?q=node/861] that she was happy to collaborate with the astronaut. “Chris is a musician and a pretty damn good one at that,” Ms. Gryner wrote late Sunday. “When Chris brought up collaborating while he was on this current mission I of course said yes with a capital Y-E-S and we went back and forth for a while figuring out what our collaboration might entail. When he told me he wanted to cover ‘Space Oddity’ I was over the moon — pardon the pun.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task was in front of me. I came up with a piano part. I then enlisted my friend, producer and fellow Canadian Joe Corcoran to take my piano idea and Chris’s vocal and blow it up into a fully produced song. Drums! Mellotrons! Fuzz bass! We also incorporated into the track ambient space station noises which Chris had put on his SoundCloud. I was mostly blown away by how pure and earnest Chris’s singing is on this track. Like weightlessness and his voice agreed to agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And voila! An astronaut sings “Space Oddity” in space!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the CBC reports[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/05/10/f-chris-hadfield.html], Mr. Hadfield’s embrace of social networks to post sounds, images and video from space has earned him a huge following:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he left Earth on Dec. 19, he had 20,000 <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> followers, a number that has grown to more than 824,000 today. Followers come from around the world, and have been particularly intrigued by his much-praised photos of places on the globe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-one videos of his I.S.S. experiences have proved an unexpected hit for the <span class="companylink">Canadian Space Agency</span>, generating 22 million views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the “Space Oddity” clip, the astronaut’s most popular <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> clip was a demonstration of what happens when you wring the water out of a washcloth[http://youtu.be/o8TssbmY-GM] in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the sounds of the space station[https://soundcloud.com/colchrishadfield/spacewalk-pressure?in=colchrishadfield/sets/space-sounds-ii] Mr. Hadfield recorded for his SoundCloud page was one titled “Spacewalk Pressure Equalization[https://soundcloud.com/colchrishadfield/spacewalk-pressure?in=colchrishadfield/sets/space-sounds-ii].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Guardian blogger Paul Owen noted[http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2013/may/13/chris-hadfield-the-astronaut-s-best-tweets-photos-and-videos], the astronaut was fully aware of the fact that many of the photographs of Earth he posted on his @Cmdr_Hadfield Twitter feed[https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield] from the space station resembled abstract expressionist paintings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft has been shut down by the failure of one of the reaction wheels that keep it pointed, the space agency announced Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't call Kepler down and out yet,'' said John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut and Hubble repairman who is NASA's associate administrator for space science, at a news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he and others said that if engineers could not restore the wheel or find some other way to keep the spacecraft's telescope precisely pointed, the failure could end one of the most romantic and successful of NASA's missions: the search for Earth-like planets in habitable orbits around other stars. Just last month, astronomers reported that Kepler had found two planets, only slightly larger than Earth, orbiting a star 1,200 light-years from here in the Goldilocks zone, where liquid water is possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More potentially habitable planets, even smaller and more Earth-like, lurk in the pipeline, astronomers say, but have not yet been confirmed. ''We believe there are planets there that we haven't found yet,'' said William Borucki of NASA's Ames Research Center, the founder and leader of the Kepler effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As word leaked about the possible loss of Kepler, the mood in the astronomical community was grim. ''It was one of those things that was a gift to humanity,'' said one astronomer, who spoke on condition of anonymity before NASA made the news public. ''We're all going to lose, for sure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler, launched in March 2009, orbits the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Its mission is to determine the fraction of stars in the galaxy that harbor Earth-like planets by carrying out a survey of some 150,000 stars in the constellations of Cygnus and Lyra, looking for the dips in starlight caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of their suns. The spacecraft has identified 130 planets and 2,740 other candidates. About 230 are the size of Earth, and 820 others are only twice as big as Earth and are probably rocky worlds similar to our own, Mr. Borucki said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler's mission has cost $600 million so far. It was designed to operate for four years, but last year it was extended three more years, until 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Earth transits the Sun only once a year, two more years would give astronomers a chance to see more transits of the planets they are looking for, ones with orbits similar to our own. Without the extra time, the data will be noisy, astronomers say, so the answer will be a little more uncertain than it might have been. Geoffrey Marcy, a Kepler astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, said that without more data coming from Kepler, he thought astronomers would be ''right on the edge'' of answering the question of how common other Earths are, but with less statistical certainty than originally desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, engineers noticed that one of the reaction wheels that keep the spacecraft pointed was experiencing too much friction. They shut down the spacecraft for a couple of weeks to give it a rest, in the hope that the wheel's lubricant would spread out and solve the problem. But when they turned it back on, the friction was still there. Until now, the problem had not interfered with observations, but on Tuesday, the spacecraft went into a so-called safe mode, and the engineers determined that the reaction wheel had stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels, but one failed last year after showing signs of erratic friction. Three wheels are required to keep Kepler properly and precisely aimed, and now there are only two. The lack of three working wheels probably robs it of the ability to point precisely enough to detect Earth-size planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Project managers hope to remedy the situation by rocking the wheel back and forth, or perhaps resurrecting the wheel that failed last year, an effort that will probably take several months, according to Kepler's deputy project manager, Charles Sobeck of the Ames Research Center. It would take that long as well to figure out what else the telescope, which is itself in fine condition, can be used for if it can no longer hunt planets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki said that the Kepler project had been a long journey -- and a phenomenal success -- and that he was not ready to pronounce it over. When Kepler was conceived, he said, nobody knew if any other stars had planets; now we know that almost every star in the galaxy has a planet and that the nearest exoplanet might be only 10 light-years away. ''I'm delighted and surprised with what we have done,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Grunsfeld, who played mechanic to the Hubble telescope during several lengthy spacewalks, the Kepler malfunction looked particularly frustrating. ''Unfortunately, it's not in a place where I can go and fix it,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA — As far as <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> hits go, Canada[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/canada/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s contribution has not yet approached the popularity of South Korea’s “Gangnam Style[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0].” And perhaps because of the limitations of weightlessness, the music video lacked any dance moves at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the video, a cover of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDChKgoETo0]” that Chris Hadfield produced in the International Space Station as his five-month command neared an end, may have cemented his reputation as the world’s best-known singing astronaut, not to mention Canada’s newest celebrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hadfield, 53, is an unlikely star. But his acoustic guitar, a series of televised publicity stunts, a steady stream of online photo postings and his hearty appetite for <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> messages from space enabled him to overcome, at least in Canada, the yawning indifference that often meets space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if a Canadian had just landed on Mars, broadcasters here provided live updates on Monday night when a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying Mr. Hadfield, the American Tom Marshburn and the Russian Roman Romanenko landed in Kazakhstan. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called Mr. Hadfield “our very own space pioneer,” and the Canadian news media prominently noted a BBC online story[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22483934] declaring that Mr. Hadfield “has probably become the most famous astronaut since the days of Neil Armstrong and Yuri Gagarin.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on Earth but not yet back in Canada, Mr. Hadfield held a televised news conference on Thursday from Houston, where he will be readjusting to gravity until next month. Asked about his fame, he said, “I hope I can just lead a normal life after this.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hadfield’s most heavily publicized achievements from space did not appear off-the-charts from a scientific point of view. He issued <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> postings like mad. He dropped a puck from space for the <span class="companylink">Toronto Maple Leafs</span>’ home opener against the <span class="companylink">Buffalo Sabres</span>. He also unveiled a new Canadian five-dollar bill and led thousands of schoolchildren in a singalong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Will Straw[http://strawresearch.mcgill.ca/], the director of the Institute for the Study of Canada at <span class="companylink">McGill University</span> in Montreal, said that what Mr. Hadfield did or did not achieve is beside the point. He is an astronaut from Canada, more than enough to ensure his fame here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Canadians are always thrilled if anybody in the world notices another Canadian,” Mr. Straw said. “It’s like the old joke about how many Canadians it takes to screw in a light bulb: 10, one to do the work and nine to point at him and say, ‘He’s Canadian.’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Mercer, a Canadian satirist, noted that Mr. Hadfield was not exactly an overnight success, having participated in two space shuttle[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/space_shuttle/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference with this trip, Mr. Mercer said, was Mr. Hadfield’s digital accessibility. When Canadians sent him requests for space photos of their hometowns through <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> or e-mail, he aimed his camera in their direction. He also participated in a sketch for Mr. Mercer’s mock news television program, “The Rick Mercer Report[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4CUR0l2_jis],” from the Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People felt that they were interacting with a guy in space, not just turning on a television,” Mr. Mercer said. “He’s a bit goofy, like a normal Canadian. We kind of see ourselves in him.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoiding any frank talks with your children about the dangers lurking ''out there'' in the universe is completely natural. Pointing out a full moon or the Big Dipper is way easier than telling your little Johnny flat-out that a single meteorite the size of his school bus would wipe out everything in the region, including us, and so all his crying now isn't going to change that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as hard as it is to see your youngsters lose their innocence just like that, tiptoeing around the topic of scary stuff in our cosmos will only create worse problems. Better to be candid now, and simply weather little Johnny's night terrors and his long phases of avoiding all friends and activities, than to hold back on the facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sooner or later your little Susie is going to find out for herself about the inevitability of an asteroid slamming into Earth -- probably through a ''friend'' or on the Internet. So shouldn't news of our planet's complete vulnerability come out of your mouth first? Take the initiative early on. That way you can at least reassure her that, as far as killer asteroids go, she's much more likely to die on an amusement-park ride or at a fireworks display.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently I was lying on a blanket in the backyard between my 7-year-old twins, Mark and Missy. We were up way past bedtime, savoring a spectacularly starry night sky. I really got going about supernova explosions of massive stars and about how this results in tremendous gamma-ray bursts that can shoot deadly beams of intense radiation many light years through space, and how, if one ever reached the Earth, it would spell extinction for everyone. I avoided the temptation to sugarcoat things. The twins needed me to tell it like it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, Mark sobbed away hysterically while Missy asked one simple question: ''Are we still gonna get a Christmas tree?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure we are,'' I said, and told the kids they'd probably have Christmas trees for the rest of their lives. I emphasized that it could even take thousands of years for any gamma ray burst to zero in on Earth and so, no worries -- we'd be long dead by then anyway. Eventually, maybe, they will take some comfort in that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard trying to control your children's feelings. Yesterday, when I told them about the chances of a huge comet someday crossing Earth's path, they became very frightened indeed. But, to my credit, I let them know that it was perfectly normal to feel scared -- I'm scared, too, I confessed -- and gave them probably too many reassuring hugs. Then I microwaved popcorn and we watched ''C.S.I.'' together, and the twins' questions turned refreshingly earthbound: What's rigid mortis? Do kids ever have to get that life insurance? How do vultures know you're dead and that you're not just knocked out? And, What does sexy mean? (''Ask your mother next week'' -- I wimped out on that one.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honesty and directness are the best tools for ever so gently shattering your children's assumption that our planet is a safe and secure place. And if this sometimes makes them feel that their lives on Earth are somehow less meaningful -- hey, welcome to the club. But steer clear of the planetarium, unless it's Laser Rock Night. Then by all means go, even if the homework isn't done.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaction wheels like the ones that NASA officials say have failed aboard the Kepler spacecraft, effectively ending its mission to detect potentially habitable planets outside the solar system, are simple devices, at least in concept. But making ones that can survive the rigors of a rocket launching and then spin for a long time to keep a spacecraft properly oriented -- in Kepler's case, to keep its telescope precisely pointed at the same field of stars -- is difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really simply, it's an electric motor turning a flywheel,'' said Doug Sinclair, whose Toronto company, Sinclair Interplanetary, makes tiny reaction wheels for suitcase-size satellites. Kepler's wheels are bigger because Kepler is bigger (with a mass of more than a ton), but they function in the same way: The rapidly spinning flywheel is accelerated or decelerated, producing a corresponding slow rotation of the spacecraft in one direction or the other. The principle at work is one that physics students and figure skaters are familiar with: conservation of angular momentum. There must be at least three wheels, one on each of three perpendicular axes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft's thrusters could also be used to control orientation, but there is a limited amount of propellant aboard. Reaction wheels use electricity, which can be produced in essentially unlimited supply by a spacecraft's solar panels. But Victoria L. Coverstone, a professor of aerospace engineering at the <span class="companylink">University of Illinois</span>, said that in some situations thrusters must still be used. The solar wind can cause a small, constant rotation of the spacecraft that can make a reaction wheel rotate faster and faster until it reaches its operational limit. When that happens, she said, a thruster can be fired to rotate the spacecraft in the opposite direction and slow the wheel, a procedure referred to as a ''momentum dump.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler has four wheels, providing some redundancy. One stopped working last July after about three years of operation, and NASA announced last week that a second had failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sinclair said the most likely source of failure was in the flywheel bearings. ''That is the No. 1 challenge in building a wheel,'' he said. ''When you launch, you shake this thing, and you're supporting this heavy flywheel on these bearings. That beats them up. Then you spin them for years.'' HENRY FOUNTAIN</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler Space Telescope is 40 million miles from Earth, which makes sending a repairman difficult. Unlike the Hubble telescope, which was designed to be serviced by astronauts, Kepler was meant to live far from Earth, well beyond a wrench's reach.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archaeology</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Maya Pyramid, Now Gravel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A construction crew in Belize needed crushed rock for a road-building project, so it turned to a convenient mound nearby and went at it with excavators. Soon the Nohmul pyramid, a historically significant Maya temple near the Mexican border, was reduced to a stump. ''Only a small chunk of the pyramid, which stood about 65 feet tall and was the center of a settlement of about 40,000 people in 250 B.C., remains after backhoes and bulldozers began removing the limestone slabs with which it was built,'' as CNN put it. The government of Belize wants to find and prosecute those responsible, as do local archaeologists. ''The Maya had to mine for this material using nothing more than stone tools,'' Dr. Jaime J. Awe of the Belize Institute of Archaeology told a Belize news station, adding that it was ''mind-boggling'' that this treasured antiquity, which took centuries to build, had been wrecked in a day by machinery that could have quarried elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public Health</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember Measles?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 1,200 cases of measles have cropped up in Britain this year, on top of 2,000 reported last year, and public health officials say that parents who refused to vaccinate their children are to blame. ''More than a decade ago, British parents refused to give measles shots to at least a million children because of now discredited research that linked the vaccine to autism,'' The Associated Press reported. ''Now, health officials are scrambling to catch up and stop a growing epidemic.'' Although developing countries still struggle with measles, the disease has all but disappeared in richer nations, except where there have been vaccine resisters. The current outbreak, centered in Wales, puts Britain behind countries like Rwanda and Cambodia in combating measles. While the research linking autism to the vaccine against measles has been found to be fraudulent and the doctor who did it has lost his medical license, some parents still refuse to inoculate their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Totally Our Fault</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a glove tossed down to climate change deniers, a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters looked at about 4,000 scientific articles about global warming and found that 97.1 percent of them concluded that rising temperatures were ''anthropogenic,'' or caused by humans. ''Our findings prove that there is a strong scientific agreement about the cause of climate change, despite public perceptions to the contrary,'' said John Cook, a postdoctoral fellow at the <span class="companylink">University of Queensland</span>, according to an article in The Guardian. Dr. Cook is a physicist, not a climate scientist, but he collects peer-reviewed papers on climate change the way some people do ''Star Trek'' memorabilia; he also maintains SkepticalScience.com, which includes a list of the ''most used climate myths and what the science really says.'' Myth No. 1: ''Climate's Changed Before.'' No. 2: ''It's the Sun.'' No. 3: ''It's Not Bad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space Exploration</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Telescope on Life Support</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kepler spacecraft has been an astronomical marvel, sending down a steady drumbeat of information that scientists use to map exotic planets far outside our solar system. But now it is in trouble, and the prospects for repair are dubious. Kepler, which is only about 9 feet by 15 feet, has four reaction wheels that are meant to keep it pointed in the right direction; at least three of them need to be working properly, and right now only two are. NASA will try to wiggle them back to life, but astronomers are deeply worried that their window to the world of exoplanets may have snapped shut. Kepler has already found more than 100 planets, providing ''a mother lode of planetary systems that we will be exploring for decades in the future,'' as Dimitar Sasselov, a Harvard professor who is one of Kepler's investigators, told The Harvard Gazette. ''Kepler has already delivered beyond expectations,'' he added. ''So it was worth every penny.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bennu or Bust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of space: NASA's plan to snatch a chunk of an asteroid and bring it back to Earth moved a bit closer to fruition last week. Under the current timeline, a play date with the asteroid in question -- named Bennu -- will take place in 2018, two years after a spacecraft is launched for this purpose. By 2023, that spacecraft will return with a piece of Bennu, no less than 2.1 ounces, after a round trip of more than 800 million miles. The project, known by the ungainly acronym Osiris-REx, might tell us a lot; as NASA put it bluntly: ''Bennu could hold clues to the origin of the solar system.'' So what's with the asteroid's name? The Bennu was a mythical heronlike bird in ancient Egypt; a third grader from North Carolina, thinking the mission's equipment looked somewhat birdlike, submitted the name to an asteroid-naming competition and won.</p>

Both labs are run by the Department of Energy, and a transfer was arranged, which will be easier said than done: The 600-ton device, used to store subatomic particles called muons, will take a circuitous two-month, 3,200-mile journey from Brookhaven, N.Y., to Batavia, Ill. ''The massive electromagnet must be transported in one piece,'' according to a news release from Brookhaven. ''It also cannot tilt or twist more than a few degrees, or the complex wiring inside will be irreparably damaged.'' Popular Science said the electromagnet ''will float from New York Harbor in June, down the East Coast, around Florida, up the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi River by July.'' After it arrives, the storage ring will function as a holding tank for muons generated by Fermilab's particle accelerators, under an experiment called Muon g-2 that will look at odd properties of matter in the subatomic world.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A singing astronaut[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/world/americas/performing-from-space-chris-hadfield-is-canadas-low-orbit-star.html] sounds almost too good to be true, but during his five-month stint aboard the International Space Station, the Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield produced a constellation of videos[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGG8ucQgEJPeUPhJZ4M4jA] about the day-to-day experiences of his life in space. He also demonstrated the power of social media to reignite interest in space missions that are often overlooked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below, we’re trying a new experiment as the school year winds down: we’re posting viral videos like this one; pairing them with related Times content; then suggesting a few quick teaching and learning ideas inspired by the combination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have a look at what we’ve done with Mr. Hadfield’s song, then us know what you think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Teaching Ideas:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Learn about life without gravity on the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use this NASA resource[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/what-is-the-iss-k4.html] to learn about the International Space Station, which was Mr. Hadfield’s home away from home for five months. Who built the space station and what is its purpose? What was Mr. Hadfield’s mission aboard the space station[http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/missions/expedition34-35/Default.asp]? Who was on board with him, and what were they doing? How do astronauts get to the station[http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/vehicles/soyuz/default.asp], and then back to Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then explore some of the day-to-day experiences of life aboard the space station — like cooking[http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/05/14/183942357/chris-hadfield-space-chef-in-chief], hand washing[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUUvlnnVMSQ], teeth brushing[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bCoGC532p8] and sleeping[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyFYgeE32f0] by viewing some of the numerous videos Mr. Hadfield produced and made available. You might even explore science themes, like the physical properties of water and why water behaves differently in space[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=o8TssbmY-GM] than it does on Earth, or how spaceflight affects the human body[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h0F1Ud0yzk] and the senses[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUaartJaon3LV-ZQ4J3bNQj4VNVG2ByIG]. You and your students can also track Mr. Hadfield’s adjustment back to life on Earth via his Twitter[https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield] feed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Hadfield was living on the space station, he fielded questions from people back home on Earth. If you could ask any question about life on the space station, what would ask? Make a list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then search the videos he posted[http://www.youtube.com/user/canadianspaceagency/videos?view=0] and see if he answered your question. If not, see if you can find the answer to your question via the Times Topics page on the International Space Station[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/international_space_station/index.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, you might view sketches[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/this-architect-was-aboard-the-space-station-45-years-ago/] by one of the first architects to make the International Space Station habitable 45 years ago; find out what astronauts there did recently when remnants of a discarded Russian satellite came dangerously near[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/science/space/space-station-crew-scrambles-as-debris-passes-nearby.html]; or read about what happens when the toilet breaks.[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/science/space/28nasaw.html]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Plan a social media campaign to interest the public in a scientific endeavor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past decades, the American public was enthralled by the United States space program, with Alan Shepard’s flight into space[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0505.html#article], the first moon landing in 1968[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0720.html] and the initiation of the space shuttle program[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/30-years-of-the-space-shuttle-a-fact-scavenger-hunt/]. But after the shuttle program retired, <span class="companylink">NASA</span> sometimes made more news traveling through city streets[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/us/space-shuttle-endeavour-rolls-through-los-angeles.html] instead of into space. In fact, without space shuttles, the United States depends on foreign governments[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/science/space/nasa-and-russia-begin-new-chapter-in-space.html], like Russia, and commercial enterprises to transport astronauts and equipment to and from the space station[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/international_space_station/index.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future of a costly space program depends on public support and enthusiasm, and Mr. Hadfield has managed to drum up that enthusiasm in Canada and around the world through his prolific YouTube videos[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGG8ucQgEJPeUPhJZ4M4jA?feature=watch], Twitter postings[https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield], photographs and Q. and A.’s during his five-month command of the International Space Station. In “Performing From Space, Canada’s Low-Orbit Star”[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/world/americas/performing-from-space-chris-hadfield-is-canadas-low-orbit-star.html], Ian Austen reports on the social media splash that Mr. Hadfield managed to create in a short period of time:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hadfield, 53, is an unlikely star. But his acoustic guitar, a series of televised publicity stunts, a steady stream of online photo postings and his hearty appetite for <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> messages from space enabled him to overcome, at least in Canada, the yawning indifference that often meets space travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As if a Canadian had just landed on Mars, broadcasters here provided live updates on Monday night when a Russian Soyuz capsule carrying Mr. Hadfield, the American Tom Marshburn and the Russian Roman Romanenko landed in Kazakhstan. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called Mr. Hadfield “our very own space pioneer,” and the Canadian news media prominently noted a BBC online story declaring that Mr. Hadfield “has probably become the most famous astronaut since the days of Neil Armstrong and Yuri Gagarin.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you were a scientist, how would you use social media and popular culture to get the public’s attention about your work? Watch Mr. Hadfield speak with Canadian reporters about the power of social media[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NX9ucLRJX8], or watch his videos about life in space (see above), read his <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> posts and look at his photographs, then use his work as a model. What could a different kind of scientist do? You might consult The Times’s Scientist at Work blog[http://scientistatwork.blogs.nytimes.com/] to get ideas, or choose something you’re studying in class right now and find scientists who work in that field. How could you use social media creatively to raise awareness and interest in your research? How, specifically, would you reach out to students?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For another model, you might read about NASA’s own foray into social media[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/science/science-topics-go-viral-on-social-media.html], particularly with the Curiosity rover mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Write the lyrics and shoot a video for a science-themed pop song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hadfield didn’t only attract the public’s attention with educational and informational videos about space, he also released an elaborately produced music video covering David Bowie’s popular tune “Space Oddity,”[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/astronaut-covers-space-oddity-from-space/] which featured his own singing and guitar playing in the space station. How do music and song lyrics possess the power to both educate people about space and excite them about space exploration?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, you may want to watch videos by the band They Might Be Giants about why the sun shines[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JdWlSF195Y&amp;list=PLOlvogJ04joUS50B-W5EEvEXwSmfr_MIp] and what shooting stars are[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqBChyNyLhU]. Or you can watch GZA, a member of the group Wu-Tang Clan, rapping about the Big Bang theory[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=O-MvmW0Z2wU].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students might write their own lyrics[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1whMAIGNq7E&amp;list=UU9FMEQpaPGlU96rd-WOfHDQ&amp;index=18], like this science teacher, to the tune of a popular song, or write a rap[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/student-contest-winners-the-2012-year-in-rap/] about the solar system, outer space, or any other science topic they’re interested in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To start, teachers might choose to provide students with a list of science terms to include in their songs or raps. Check out the warm-up in our lesson on writing song lyrics about the Large Hadron Collider[http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/a-smashing-good-time-writing-songs-about-the-large-hadron-collider/] for ideas (and you may also want to watch the “Large Hadron Rap” video[http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=j50ZssEojtM#!] as well). Our “List, Group, Label”[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/studentactivity/ListGroupLabel_Student.pdf] handout (PDF) and teacher instructions[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/studentactivity/ListGroupLabel_Teacher.pdf] (PDF) may be useful to help students organize their ideas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an extension of this activity, or for inspiration, students may want to listen closely to the lyrics of popular songs about space and try to interpret their meaning. To start, play the song “Space Oddity”[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D67kmFzSh_o] by Mr. Bowie[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/arts/19iht-fbowie19.html] and show students the lyrics. Have them write individual responses to the song: What do they think the song is about? What mood do the lyrics evoke? What do they think Mr. Bowie implies in the final lines of the song? Then show them how Mr. Hadfield covered the song[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/astronaut-covers-space-oddity-from-space/] from the International Space Station. With his subtle changes to the song’s lyrics[http://popdust.com/2013/05/13/chris-hadfield-space-oddity-lyrics-breakdown-this-time-its-a-happy-song/], did he change the song’s meaning? How?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To broaden the discussion, play students a few more songs that reference space or any other area of scientific endeavor. For example, what do you think the singer Moby means when he sings, “we are all made of stars[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFsbmdv_p2M]”? What astronomical event does the Cure reference in the song “Jupiter Crash”[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dAdIqImoZw]? How do the lyrics[http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/jupitercrash.html] use the much-hyped, but ultimately lackluster crash of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/us/comet-pummels-jupiter-revealing-details.html] into the planet Jupiter as a metaphor for a fizzling relationship?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The road to Mars is long and fraught with danger. What it doesn't have is restaurants. So a mechanical engineer, Anjan Contractor, has won a $125,000 grant from NASA to build a 3-D printer that can take the basic building blocks of food -- oil, water, protein and tomato powders -- and turn them into edible items like chocolate and pizza, the online magazine Quartz reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is that the system can provide enough food to sustain astronauts during journeys to Mars and beyond. Presumably, the menu will expand to include healthier options. The device, to be developed on open-source software, drew instant comparisons to the ''Star Trek'' meals-on-demand machine, the replicator.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Power of a 3-D Printer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> used a 3-D printer to create a synthetic body part that enabled a child with a rare birth defect to breathe on his own, The New England Journal of Medicine reported. The 20-month-old boy, Kaiba Gionfriddo of Youngstown, Ohio, was born with tracheobronchomalacia, in which the airway walls are so weak that they can collapse just from coughing. Kaiba had suddenly stopped breathing at 3 months and was placed on a ventilator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With emergency clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, the doctors used a digital image of Kaiba's airway to produce a tiny tracheal splint made from a biodegradable polymer. Placed inside the throat, the sprint allows the normal trachea to grow and strengthen gradually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes about two to three years for the trachea to remodel and grow into a healthy state,'' said Dr. Scott Hollister, one of two doctors who performed the operation, ''and that's about how long this material will take to dissolve into the body.'' The operation took place in February last year; Kaiba is reportedly still doing well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roaches Adapt Yet Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cockroaches have devised a novel tactic for avoiding poison traps laced with glucose: They have switched their internal chemistry around so that glucose no longer tastes good to them. Now, instead of firing the nerves that detect something as sweet, glucose triggers the nerves that flag something as bitter, researchers at <span class="companylink">North Carolina State University</span> reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cockroaches began avoiding glucose-laced traps in the early 1990s, said roach experts, though until now, no one understood why. The good news is that the findings could help humans devise smarter weapons against the pests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amphibians Are Vanishing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amphibians, on the other hand, are proving less resilient to modern dangers. The <span class="companylink">United States Geological Survey</span> reported frogs, salamanders and toads disappeared at the alarming rate of 3.7 percent a year from 2002 to 2011. For truly at-risk species, the annual vanishing rate is 11.6 percent. Writing in PLoS One, the researchers blamed a combination of habitat loss, climate change and disease. Interestingly, they were unable to establish a direct link between the declines and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a skin fungus that scientists have lately pointed to as a risk factor for amphibians.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Culprit of Potato Famine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 160 years, everything from fungus to slothfulness has been blamed for the Irish potato famine. But an international team of scientists, using DNA from Irish potato leaves preserved since 1847, said they had found the real culprit: a previously unknown strain of Phytophthora infestans (a funguslike microbe) they called HERB-1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blight turned potatoes mushy and inedible, leading to the deaths of more than a million people during the famine, said the researchers, who published their work in the journal eLife.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They think this particular strain, or its immediate ancestor, traveled north from Mexico and also to Europe, then died out and was replaced by a modern strain known as US-1.

Dr. O'Dell led a research team that used Hubble and several other telescopes to produce the best views of the nebula to date. The new images show the ring wrapped around a football-shaped cloud of glowing helium, fueled by radiation from a white dwarf star in the middle. Following the nebula outward, that hot blue gas gives way to progressively cooler green, yellow and red gas. By studying the nebula, researchers hope to better understand the Sun's coming demise (six billion years from now, give or take).</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts traveling to Mars, bombarded by the radiation of outer space, would face modestly higher risks of cancer, new NASA measurements confirm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings could lead to a search for better shields to block the radiation, new propulsion technologies to shorten the trip, or a decision by the space agency to recalibrate the allowable risks for such an ambitious interplanetary mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation on the journey to Mars was measured by NASA's newest Mars rover, Curiosity, which carries an instrument the size of a coffee maker that was originally intended to gauge radiation on the planet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investigators realized that by turning on the instrument right after the rover's launching in November 2011, they could gather data on the radiation hitting the spacecraft from solar storms and from high-energy cosmic rays that come from outside the galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They determined that ''the radiation environment is several hundred times more intense than it is on Earth,'' Cary Zeitlin, a scientist at the <span class="companylink">Southwest Research Institute</span> in Boulder, Colo., said during a NASA news conference on Thursday, ''and that's even inside a shielded spacecraft.'' The findings will be published in Friday's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radiation dosage is measured in units known as sieverts. A cumulative dose of one sievert is thought to raise the risk of a fatal cancer by about five percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Curiosity's 253-day, 350-million-mile trip, the rover absorbed about half a sievert -- an average of 1.8 thousandths of a sievert per day, mostly from cosmic rays. ''That could be higher under different circumstances,'' Dr. Zeitlin said. The instrument measured radiation from only five solar storms, all modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is not planning to send people to Mars until the 2030s, but with current technology, it would take six months to get there and six months to return to Earth. As such, astronauts would absorb about two-thirds of a sievert. By contrast, a person on Earth receives less than a thousandth of a sievert per year from outer space, Dr. Zeitlin said. Americans absorb a few thousandths of a sievert per year, mostly from X-rays and CT scans -- still much less than from a Mars trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">National Cancer Institute</span>, the lifetime risk of dying from cancer is 21 percent; the two-thirds of a sievert from a round-trip mission to Mars would raise that risk by three percentage points, to 24 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measurements largely agree with earlier estimates and measurements. ''These are confirmatory measurements that will help us refine our models,'' said Edward J. Semones, the spaceflight radiation health officer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's standards currently limit the excess cancer risk for its astronauts to three percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We currently would exceed our acceptable limits,'' Dr. Semones said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for a human mission to Mars say the radiation risk is overblown. ''What it shows is that the cosmic ray dose on a Mars mission is not a show-stopper,'' Robert Zubrin, founder and president of the Mars Society, said about the new data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is modest proportion of overall risk,'' he added. ''Therefore, what it means is that we don't need to delay a humans-to-Mars program until we have a miraculous advanced propulsion system that can get us there faster.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spacecraft malfunction during the mission would pose a much greater risk to the astronauts than the radiation, Dr. Zubrin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The radiation risk has also not deterred plans by a private group, the Inspiration Mars Foundation, to launch a married couple on a 501-day flyby of Mars in January 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those numbers are less than the risk a lot of people take in sports,'' said Taber MacCallum, the chief technology officer for the foundation. ''They don't seem that unreasonable to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another private group, Mars One, which hopes to establish a settlement on Mars in the 2020s, said it had already received thousands of applications.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- China's next space mission begins this month when a capsule carrying three astronauts will dock with an orbiting module, a spokesman for the space program said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts will be on board a Shenzhou 10 capsule, which will be launched on a rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing the spokesman, whom the agency did not name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be China's fifth space mission with astronauts, and the latest step in the country's efforts to master the technology needed to establish a long-term human presence in space. China's first spaceflight with astronauts on board was in 2003; the most recent one was a year ago, which involved a docking with the Tiangong 1, a small module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spokesman told Xinhua that the astronauts this time will again dock with the module and perform experiments while there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese government scientists have also said they may eventually attempt to send an astronaut to the moon.</p>
