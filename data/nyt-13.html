<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're sure that somewhere a marketer is already designing the campaign for Moon Water -- available, of course, in attractive, biodegradable containers. Scientists analyzing data collected by three spacecraft have discovered that there may be a fair amount of water -- or hydroxyl, which is one hydrogen atom short of being water -- on the Moon, albeit spread out in millimeter-thin layers on or near the surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will take some re-imagining, especially after those pictures from the Apollo missions that showed a spectacularly dry, dusty and oasis-free place. It is also a place where temperature swings are extreme, which means it should be inhospitable to a volatile compound like water. These new findings suggest that there is water lurking not only in permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles but also elsewhere on the lunar surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a decision is made to build a new space base on the Moon -- and space enthusiasts differ on the value of doing so -- it may be able to extract some water and oxygen from the soil. As for where the water comes from, scientists suggest it may be created when protons in the solar wind collide with the Moon's surface and trigger reactions that produce water. Forty years ago, there was evidence of water in the lunar soil samples brought back by astronauts. At the time, scientists dismissed the possibility. The Moon was too dry, and they assumed that the samples had been corrupted by Houston's moist air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what comes of living on a truly wet planet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists working on the NASA mission to Mercury will get a bit of holiday cheer on Monday, as the agency's Messenger spacecraft speeds toward its third encounter with the planet and snaps about 1,500 pictures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A planetary flyby is very much like Christmas morning to the science team,'' said Sean C. Solomon, a scientist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and the principal investigator of the mission. ''We're looking forward to this flyby. We know there are presents under the tree.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Messenger travels within 142 miles of Mercury at 12,000 miles per hour, the spacecraft's camera will swivel to stare at a succession of craters and other geological features that caught scientists' eyes during an earlier flyby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are using this flyby for new and ambitious targeting observations of the planet,'' said Noam R. Izenberg, a scientist at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University who is responsible for one of Messenger's instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One target will be an old 90-mile-wide crater. Another will be young 13-mile crater and a splash of light-colored soil surrounding it. A third crater of interest has materials of unusual color perhaps produced by violent volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messenger will also observe the atoms, including calcium and sodium, streaming into space from the planet's tenuous atmosphere, almost like the tail of a comet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important objective of the flyby on Monday, however, is to use Mercury's gravity as a brake, slowing down by 6,000 miles per hour. ''The maneuver itself is absolutely critical to the rest of our mission,'' Dr. Solomon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Messenger slows, Mercury will speed up a smidgen, said Eric Finnegan, the mission systems engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched in 2004, Messenger -- the name is a contraction of Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging -- has been doing a 4.9-billion-mile do-si-do through the inner solar system. It has passed Earth once, Venus twice and now Mercury three times, as it uses the gravitational pull of the planets to spiral inward toward the Sun and put itself into position to enter Mercury's orbit in March 2011 for a year of observations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have spotted a huge ring around Saturn, the largest planetary ring seen so far in the solar system. The faint ring, made of tiny particles, partly marks the orbit of Saturn's distant moon Phoebe, the lead investigator, Anne Verbiscer of the University of Virginia, and colleagues reported in the journal Nature. Phoebe orbits Saturn at a radius of about eight million miles and, evidently, objects colliding with Phoebe and kicking up dust keep the ring supplied with material. ''The closest analogs to the Phoebe ring are the two gossamer rings associated with Jupiter's inner satellites, Thebe and Amalthea,'' the researchers wrote. These moons, too, are the source of dust kicked up by collisions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Scientists who slammed a bus-size projectile into the Moon on Friday, hitting exactly the spot they were aiming for, say it will take weeks to figure out what they did, and did not, see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 230,000 miles from Earth, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite hit a bull's-eye -- two, actually -- on the Moon. But the initial images at least, both from the spacecraft and telescopes on Earth, failed to capture expected plumes of debris rising out of the impacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 4:31 a.m. Pacific time (7:31 a.m. Eastern time), one piece of Lcross slammed into the bottom of a crater, excavating hundreds of tons of the Moon. Trailing four minutes behind, a second piece sent its observations back to Earth before it also slammed into the same crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The absence of a visible plume disappointed the hundreds of enthusiasts who braved a chilly evening outside at the NASA Ames Research Center here, which operated the spacecraft, to watch the live images transmitted from the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Anthony Colaprete, the mission's principal investigator, was ecstatic. ''We got the data we need to address the questions,'' he said at a news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of greatest interest is whether there is water ice hidden in the crater's perpetual darkness and frigidness. The data could play into the debate over where NASA's human spaceflight program should aim next, whether to return to the Moon or head elsewhere in the solar system neighborhood. The presence of large significant amounts of water could make it easier to set up future settlements with the ice providing water and oxygen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has already confirmed the presence of hydrogen deep within permanently shadowed craters near the Moon's poles, and hydrogen is most likely in the form of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lcross (pronounced L-cross) is a $79 million companion mission to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, sharing the same rocket into space in June. The mission designers took advantage of what would have otherwise been space junk -- the rocket's two-ton, second stage -- and turned it into a projectile to hit the Moon, shepherded by a car-size spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the orbiter entered orbit around the Moon, Lcross swung into a wide polar orbit around the Earth that, by design, would intersect with the Moon's path four months later at 5,600 miles per hour, or twice the speed of a bullet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target of Lcross was Cabeus crater, about 60 miles wide near the south pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Colaprete said the Lcross spacecraft captured a flash of light as the upper stage hit the bottom of Cabeus and then captured a thermal image of the resulting crater, about 60 to 65 feet wide, close to what had been predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was missing was the plume of debris that was knocked out by the impact. ''We saw a crater. We saw a flash,'' Dr. Colaprete said. ''Something had to happen in between.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ground-based telescopes that had been pointed to that crater at the bottom of the Moon also failed to spot the theatrics, at least at first glance of their images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As far as I can tell from our quick processing, we did not see any plume,'' said William C. Keel, a professor of astronomy at the University of Alabama who was operating a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the expended rocket stage hit a rocky area or a slope, the debris may not have been tossed high enough to reach sunlight and thus not have been seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lcross's spectrometers -- instruments that break down light into wavelengths and detect subtle changes, perhaps from vapor or fine particles not visible to the eye -- did observe changes before and after the impact. Dr. Colaprete said the spectrometer data could identify the water and other molecules. ''When I saw actually the spectra, I was like, ''We got something,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis will take at least a few days and maybe weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to take our time'' Dr. Colaprete said, ''and build up a case for water and the ejecta, if it's there or the case against it if it's not there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Lcross itself had the best view of the first impact, a host of telescopes in space and on Earth, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck telescope in Hawaii, were also gazing at the Moon. The other telescopes also tried to observe the second impact of the Lcross spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several hundred people spent a chilly night on a grassy lawn at the Ames Research Center. They listened to Charlie Duke, one of the Apollo 16 astronauts, and watched three space-themed films -- ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' ''The Dish'' and ''October Sky'' -- projected on a 40-foot screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they watched the same NASA coverage of the mission, streamed over the Internet, that they could have watched at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's adventurous and nerdy at the same time,'' said Karin Atkins of Sunnyvale, Calif., one of those pulling an outdoors all-nighter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers have discovered a second planet outside Earth's solar system with some crucial chemical ingredients for life, according to NASA. Molecules of water, methane and carbon dioxide were detected on a hot gaseous planet that is about 150 light years from Earth, larger than Jupiter and inhospitable to life, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said. Mark Swain, a researcher with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and his colleagues made the discovery using data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The planet, HD 209458b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Pegasus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Setting the stage for a major overhaul of the nation's human spaceflight program, a blue-ribbon panel said Thursday that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should consider scrapping the rocket it had been developing to replace the space shuttles and bypassing the Moon for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 157-page report titled ''Seeking a Human Spaceflight Program Worthy of a Great Nation,'' most of the options proposed by the 10-member panel turn to private companies to provide astronauts with the ride to low-Earth orbit and replace Moon landings with the ''flexible path'' approach -- flybys of the Moon and Mars and visits to asteroids and deep-space locales that do not require development of complicated landers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems to us that would be a more sensible program,'' the panel's chairman, Norman R. Augustine, said in a news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a question, Mr. Augustine agreed that the rocket under development, the Ares I, was not the right one for NASA and that it was not going to the right place. ''I would say that's a fair portrayal,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel's report does not provide many surprises beyond what was discussed in a series of hearings over the summer and an executive summary released last month, but explains the panel's reasoning in greater detail. It also concluded that NASA would not be able to push beyond low-Earth orbit without a budget increase of about $3 billion a year. The agency is ''at a tipping point,'' the report said, ''primarily due to a mismatch of goals and resources.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Either additional funds need to be made available,'' it went on, ''or a far more modest program involving little or no exploration needs to be adopted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond dissatisfaction with NASA's current course, the Obama administration has given little indication which options it might choose, whether it would support a budget increase for NASA or even when it will decide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Against a backdrop of serious challenges with the existing program, the Augustine committee has offered several key findings and a range of options for how the nation might improve its future human space flight activities,'' said a White House spokesman, Nicholas S. Shapiro. ''We will be reviewing the committee's analysis, and then ultimately the president will be making the final decisions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview on Wednesday with The Huntsville Times in Alabama, the NASA administrator, Charles F. Bolden Jr., said he planned to meet with President Obama by the end of the year to present the agency's views on what it should be doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under NASA's current plans, developed after the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, the remaining three space shuttles are to be retired next year after completion of the International Space Station. A new series of rockets is supposed to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For NASA to continue operating the space station through 2020, five years longer than currently planned, and still reach the Moon, the current program would require $159 billion from 2010 to 2020, the panel calculated, far more than the $100 billion that the current budget guidance from the Obama administration lays out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said $100 billion was too little for any plausible push out of Earth orbit, but it said other possibilities were feasible if financing were raised to $128 billion over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prototype of the Ares I is on the launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, scheduled to lift off on Tuesday morning. That test flight, with a less-powerful first stage and a dummy second stage, was devised to gather data to aid in refining the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full rocket and the astronaut-carrying capsule on top are not scheduled to begin operation until March 2015. Because of NASA's budget constraints, the panel predicted that the date of the first flight would very likely slip two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel did not call Ares I an engineering failure but rather more a casualty of changing circumstances and of budgets one-third smaller than originally planned for. ''With time and sufficient funds, NASA could develop, build and fly the Ares I successfully,'' the panel wrote. ''The question is, Should it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the delays, the Ares I may be too late for one of its primary tasks: ferrying astronauts to and from the space station. Its defenders point to its simple design, arguing that it will be far safer than earlier rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While agreeing that the Ares I's simplicity was an asset, the panel was unconvinced that the rocket would be markedly safer than competing concepts that similarly consist of a reliable booster and a crew capsule with a launching escape system. Further, the planned launching rate for the Ares I is no more than two a year, ''raising questions about the sustainability of safe operations,'' the panel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel did not call for throwing away all of the development work for Ares I. Among other options explored, the panel was more favorable toward NASA's developing the Ares V Lite. Currently, the Ares I is to complemented by a heavy-lift rocket, the Ares V. The Ares V Lite would be a smaller version, using the solid rocket booster developed from the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel also discussed developing a heavy-lift rocket based on rockets currently used by the Air Force to lift satellites or one based more closely on the space shuttle design.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first flight in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's program to build a next-generation rocket to replace the space shuttle could also be the swan song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching of the Ares I-X, a prototype, is scheduled for 8 a.m. Tuesday. It comes less than a week after a blue-ribbon panel reviewing NASA's human spaceflight program released its final report, which offers a less-than-ringing endorsement of the Ares I rocket and brings the entire program into question. Most of the options explored by the panel look to alternatives from commercial companies to carry astronauts into Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $450 million Ares I-X is almost the same size and shape as the planned Ares I, but with a less powerful first stage and a dummy second stage. The test flight will carry 700 sensors to measure stress, temperature, vibrations and other data that will give engineers a chance to validate and tweak their designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the Ares I, which is part of NASA's Constellation program intended to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020, have described it as too expensive, underpowered and technically flawed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest problem with the Ares I, however, is that it might be too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA had originally hoped that it might begin carrying astronauts to the International Space Station in 2012. The current NASA schedule calls for the first flight in 2015, but the review panel concluded that with the agency's financial constraints, the Ares I was not likely to make its first manned flight until 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel said the Ares I program did not suffer from any showstopping technical issues but wondered whether NASA should instead focus on building a heavy-lift rocket that would be needed for missions beyond Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite questions about the fate of the Ares I, the Ares I-X test will proceed as planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do think it's appropriate to fly the Ares I-X,'' said Norman R. Augustine, the panel's chairman. ''We think there are important things to be learned that will help the program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skinny rocket, towering 327 feet, is the tallest to sit on a launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida since the 363-foot Saturn V rockets used for the moon landings in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The vehicle is in great shape,'' Jeffrey G. Spaulding, the test director, said at a news conference Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight will be a short one, never reaching orbit. The first stage, which essentially consists of a spare solid rocket booster from the space shuttle program, will burn for about two minutes, lifting the 1.8-million-pound Ares I-X eastward to an altitude of 25 miles. Then the first stage will separate and descend by parachute, while the dummy second stage will continue along its parabolic arc and dive into the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stormy weather, however, might keep the Ares I-X on the ground. Although the flight needs only about 15 minutes of good weather in the four-hour launching window that stretches from 8 a.m. to noon, Kathy Winters, the weather officer for the launching, said there was only a 40 percent chance of favorable weather on Tuesday. Wednesday is more promising, with a 60 percent chance of favorable weather during the 8 a.m. to noon window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of conflicts with launchings from the neighboring Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, if Ares I-X cannot get off the pad on Wednesday, the test may be delayed to November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I is to have a five-segment solid rocket motor, compared with the four-segment motors used for the shuttle boosters and the Ares I-X. The first ground test of the five-segment motor was successfully conducted in September in Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the differences between the two rockets, engineers designed the weight of the second stage and the flight path so that the Ares I-X will experience forces similar to those the Ares I would experience on its way to orbit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A plasma rocket engine now in development could reduce the travel time to Mars by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRAPHIC: CONVENTIONAL ROCKETS: Current chemical rockets burn their fuel quickly and then send their payload to glide on a curved path to its destination. Spacecraft like the Mars Phoenix Lander, which was launched atop a conventional rocket in 2007, take about 295 days to reach Mars.; PROTOTYPE VASIMR ROCKET: Currently being tested, this plasma rocket engine uses argon gas and electromagnetic energy to generate thrust.; TESTING IN SPACE: In 2013, a twin-engine Vasimr is scheduled to be attached to the International Space Station for testing. If successful, it could eventually provide gentle thrust for boosting the station's orbit.; PLASMA ROCKET: Vasimr, short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, would provide weak but continuous thrust during a Mars flight. A craft using Vasimr rockets would spend a month in orbit around the Earth gaining speed, then reach Mars in about 85 days by continually adjusting its thrust to follow a faster, more direct path.; HOW IT WORKS: To create thrust, Vasimr turns argon into plasma, a superheated state of matter in which negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions mix together.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cloudy skies and a wayward cargo ship at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida disrupted the launching of a prototype of a rocket intended to replace the space shuttles. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will try again Wednesday morning when forecasts put the chances of favorable weather at 60 percent. The launching of the rocket, the Ares I-X, had been scheduled for 8 a.m. Eastern time, but clouds above the launching pad thwarted that timetable. When a break in the clouds appeared, NASA decided to launch the rocket at 9:44 a.m., but a cargo ship in the Atlantic sailed too close to the launching area. The countdown resumed as the ship moved away, but the clouds returned and did not clear again before noon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- For first time since 1981, the rocket that took off Wednesday from a launching pad at the Kennedy Space Center here was not a space shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a clearing in a partly cloudy sky, the Ares I-X rocket -- a prototype of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's next-generation Ares I rocket -- zipped off at 11:30 a.m., heading east over the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After rising through blue sky for two minutes, the first stage expended its fuel at an altitude of more than 25 miles, separated and parachuted into the ocean. After separation, the dummy second stage spun around before plunging into the ocean. The final Ares I rocket is to have a second-stage engine and a crew capsule to carry four astronauts into orbit to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As tall as a 32-story building but with a first stage only 12 feet wide, the Ares I-X looked skinny and top-heavy. Yet it flew as envisioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the NASA team working on the Constellation program to send astronauts to the Moon and beyond, the flight was a moment of smiles and joy, if not quite vindication. Critics have described the Ares I, which would be the first Constellation rocket to fly, as too expensive and technically flawed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vindication really does not describe it well,'' the program manager, Jeffrey Hanley, said at a news conference after the flight. ''It's a sense of validation that the course we have laid out is executable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hanley said the flight should sweep aside any doubts that the design was workable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blue-ribbon panel reviewing NASA's human spaceflight program said Ares I faced no insurmountable problems, but the group wondered if the agency might better spend its effort on a heavy-lift rocket and turn the business of carrying astronauts over to private companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Ares I-X's success, proponents of Constellation may argue more passionately that maintaining the current path is a better choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the naysayers, that was just one of the most beautiful rocket launches I've ever seen,'' Robert D. Cabana, director of the Kennedy Space Center, told the people in the control room afterwards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching came a day after efforts were thwarted by cloudy skies. Liftoff was rescheduled for 8 a.m. but then delayed as engineers checked electronic systems after lightning struck within a half-mile of the launching pad on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once ready, the mission managers waited on the weather. For spectators on the ground, the weather seemed not bad at all, with no signs of rain and a sky of broken clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the Ares I-X is a new design, the weather criteria were stricter than for a shuttle launching. The worry was that if the rocket flew through a cloud, the friction of the water droplets could create static charge and disrupt communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 11:20 a.m., a break in the clouds big enough for the rocket opened up. Ten minutes later, the rocket's engine -- essentially a space shuttle solid rocket booster -- ignited with a window-rattling roar. By design, the rocket tilted away from the launching tower, then headed skyward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ares I-X carried more than 700 sensors to measure the stresses and strains on the spacecraft. The data from the $445 million flight will allow engineers to refine their computer models and designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first flight of the Ares I carrying astronauts is scheduled for March 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that a race halfway across the universe had ended in a virtual tie. And so the champion is still Albert Einstein -- for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The race was between gamma rays of differing energies and wavelengths spit in a burst from an exploding star when the universe was half its present age. After a journey of 7.3 billion light-years, they all arrived within nine-tenths of a second of one another in a detector on NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, at 8:22 p.m., Eastern time, on May 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said the gamma-ray race was one of the most stringent tests yet of a bedrock principle of modern physics: Einstein's proclamation in his 1905 theory of relativity that the speed of light is constant and independent of its color, or energy; its direction; or how you yourself are moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I take it as a confirmation that Einstein is still right,'' Peter F. Michelson of Stanford, principal investigator for Fermi's Large Area Telescope and one of 206 authors of a paper published online Wednesday in the journal Nature, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no evidence so far that the energy or wavelength of light affects its speed through space. That is important because of what it could say about the structure of space-time. Some theorists have suggested that space on very small scales has a granular structure that would speed some light waves faster than others -- in short, that relativity could break down on the smallest scales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Michelson and others emphasize that while the new Fermi results do not yet eliminate the prospect, further observations with more gamma-ray bursts could eventually verify or refute the hypothesis. That would have a major effect on physicists' efforts to unify the Einsteinian gravity that governs outer space with the weird quantum laws that govern the inner space of the atom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mario Livio, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, called the Fermi results an interesting effect but not revolutionary by any stretch. ''The beauty of the experiment is not as much in what it achieves,'' Dr. Livio said, ''as in the fact that you can use astronomical observations to place some interesting limits on very fundamental physics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quantum theory, as Einstein discovered to his chagrin, reduces life on subatomic scales to a game of chance in which elementary particles can be here or there but not in between. One consequence is that space-time itself should become discontinuous and chaotic when viewed at very close distances, the way an ocean that looks smooth from an airplane appears choppy and foamy up close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, the story goes, could have an effect on the propagation of light -- or photons, as they are called in quantum-speak -- slowing light with short wavelengths relative to light with longer wavelengths. The higher the energy of a photon, the shorter is its wavelength. One way to think about it is to envision the photons as boats on this choppy sea. The small ones, like tugboats, have to climb up and down the waves to get anywhere, while the bigger ones can slice through the waves and bumps like ocean liners, and thus go a little faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now such quantum gravity theories have been untestable. Ordinarily you would have to see details as small as 10-33 centimeters -- the so-called Planck length, which is vastly smaller than an atom -- to test these theories in order to discern the bumpiness of space. Getting that kind of information is far beyond the wildest imaginations of the builders of even the most modern particle accelerators, and that has left quantum gravity theorists with little empirical guidance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's really lacking,'' Dr. Michelson explained, ''is a laboratory experiment that tells us anything. So we have to use cosmology: we use the universe as the lab.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The photons from GRB 090510, detected on May 9, ranged from 10,000 electron volts -- the energy unit of choice in physics -- to 31 billion electron volts, a factor of more than a million, in seven brief bursts over about two seconds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spread in travel time of 0.9 second between the highest- and lowest-energy gamma rays, if attributed to quantum effects rather than the dynamics of the explosion itself, suggested that any quantum effects in which the slowing of light is proportional to its energy do not show up until you get down to sizes about eight-tenths of the Planck length, according to the Nature paper, whose lead author was Sylvain Guiriec of the University of Alabama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Livio emphasized that this was only one of many classes of models. ''It would be amazing that in effect we don't need a quantum theory of gravity,'' he said. ''This only tells us where there are the dead ends.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, other physicists said that even this model would not be ruled out until the size limit had been set much below the Planck size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news, astronomers said, is that more data expected from Fermi could decide the question. As Lee Smolin, a quantum gravity theorist from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, said,''So a genuine experimental test of a hypothesized quantum gravity effect is in progress.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the last word belongs to Einstein, Robert P. Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics wrote in an e-mail message paraphrasing a 1919 headline in The New York Times about observations that confirmed Einstein's general relativity. ''But the Nature story,'' Dr. Kirshner wrote, ''is 'Einstein found right again. Heavens not askew! Savants not agog!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: A Sprint Across Bumpy Space-Time: Quantum theory says that up very close, space-time appears discontinuous and chaotic, characteristics that would have an effect on the propagation of light. A NASA experiment found no evidence of such an effect.(Source: Nature)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, NASA's space-based Swift satellite sent back a text message announcing that it had detected a gamma-ray burst, the remains of an extraordinarily violent explosion that ended the life of a distant star. Since then, astronomers using ground-based telescopes have been able to measure the spectrum of the burst's infrared afterglow and estimate its distance from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you look at the stars, you are looking at light that comes from the past. This gamma-ray burst, officially GRB 090423, is, in fact, the most distant, and oldest object, yet detected in our universe; it is some 13.1 billion light-years away. In other words, this is the vestige of an explosion that took place a mere (when it comes to the life of the universe) 630 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Light coming to us from such a distance is stretched because the universe is expanding. The greater the stretching -- called redshift -- the more distant the object. The previous most-distant object, a galaxy, has a redshift of 6.96. GRB 090423 has a redshift of 8.2 and appears to observers as an extremely red point of light. When that explosion took place, the universe was more than nine times smaller than it is now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one thing to explore such remote recesses of time in theory. It's something else again to witness their afterglow. And GRB 090423 is an invitation for all of us to unfetter our imaginations. We imagine looking outward from that distant point knowing that our own exploration still lies some 13 billion years in the future.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest episode of their continuing efforts to embrace and understand the dark side of creation, astronomers sifting data from a new satellite say they have discerned the existence of a mysterious haze of high-energy particles surrounding the center of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody knows where the particles came from, and the five astronomers who posted their results online on Monday did not offer a formal opinion. But one tantalizing prospect, they admit, is that the particles are the decayed remains of the long-sought dark matter that constitutes 25 percent of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think it could be dark matter,'' said one of the authors, Douglas Finkbeiner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If true, it would mean that astronomy has finally entered the realm of seeing the unseeable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The identity of this dark matter, presumably exotic elementary particles left over from the Big Bang, is one of the biggest mysteries in physics. Other experts, however, say it is far too soon to draw such far-reaching conclusions based on signals from the confused and energetic environs of the galactic center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my opinion, they are skating on very thin ice,'' said Eliott Bloom of Stanford, a member of the team running NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, which recorded the signals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And indeed, promising signals of dark matter from an alphabet soup of cosmic observing satellites and balloons have popped up in recent months and then disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the new paper -- by Gregory Dobler of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Calif., and four other physicists from Harvard and New York University -- has created a buzz among astrophysicists and is sure to be discussed next week at a conference in Washington on results from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is the origin of a haze of gamma rays surrounding the center of our galaxy, which does not appear connected to any normal astrophysical cause but matches up with a puzzling cloud of radio waves, a ''microwave haze,'' discovered previously by NASA's WMAP satellite around the center. Both the gamma rays and the microwaves, Dr. Dobler and his colleagues argue, could be caused by the same thing: a cloud of energetic electrons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electrons could, in turn, be the result of decaying dark matter, but that, they said, is an argument they will make in a future paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message, one of the authors, Neal Weiner of N.Y.U., explained, ''It seemed it was important to have a less controversial first paper,'' just establishing the electron cloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordon Kane, a particle physicist at the University of Michigan, called the present paper a solid result, adding, ''They have demonstrated they know how to use the Fermi data.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Bloom said the authors were going too fast. ''The galactic center is the Hells Kitchen of astrophysical forces,'' he said, borrowing a phrase from a recent talk by his French colleague Johann Coehn-Tanugi of Laboratoire de Physique Theorique et Astrophysique, and the University Montpellier 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separating the potential dark matter signal from the astronomical background sources could take years, Dr. Bloom said, especially as the new Fermi satellite adds to the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center of the galaxy, being the center of the local cosmos, is filled with all kinds of high-energy objects, like a giant black hole millions of times more massive than the Sun, the whirly-gig beams of pulsars, exploding stars and their remains. Cosmological calculations indicate that it should also be full of dark matter particles, whose clumps form the gravitational scaffolding for the thin film of visible matter in the universe. According to many models of dark matter, such particles, when they meet, can annihilate one another in a flash of energy, which would add to the cacophony from the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So astronomers have had their antennae out looking for suspicious signals from the sky. One of them was the microwave haze discovered earlier by the WMAP satellite. Dr. Finkbeiner and his colleagues had argued that the haze could be produced by energetic electrons and positrons -- their antimatter opposites -- whirling around in the Milky Way's magnetic field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If such electrons existed, they should also produce gamma rays when starlight bounced off them and, thus, show up in the Fermi data. As they approached the data, Dr. Finkbeiner said, ''we had some trepidation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, when all the known sources of gamma rays were erased from Fermi observations of the Milky Way center, they were left with a blob of radiation, about 12,000 light-years across, matching the microwave haze exactly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existence of this new gamma ray haze, they say in their paper, settles the question of the origin of the microwave haze, although others like Dr. Bloom disagree. And the question of whether and how these clouds are connected to dark matter is yet to be fought out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a model of dark matter recently proposed by Dr. Weiner and others, there is a ''dark force'' as well as a dark particle; when the dark particles crash into one another, they first produce the carriers of this force, which then decay after thousands or millions of years into the electrons and positrons creating these observed clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Kane favors a simpler view -- namely that dark matter particles decay directly into gamma rays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Finkbeiner said Dr. Kane's predictions also fit the gamma ray cloud very well. ''Kane's prediction is freakishly similar to what we are seeing.'' But, he admitted, a simple adjustment in models of what kinds of electrons are produced by pulsars could also change the results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bloom said that with all the confusion and uncertainty, it was easy to be misled. ''Depending on what the part of the elephant you're feeling,'' he said, ''you can have very different models that fit part of what you're looking at.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need more data and time to make this work,'' he said about Fermi and the quest for dark matter. ''It is not something that will come easily.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six months of pondering their predicament, NASA engineers said that they would begin trying to drive the Mars rover Spirit out of a sand trap where it became stuck last spring. They acknowledged, however, that the odds were not good. ''This could end up where Spirit remains,'' said Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at the headquarters for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Spirit and its twin, Opportunity, have been roving the surface of Mars since landing in 2004. Opportunity is still going strong, NASA says, but as Spirit was backing over some rocks in April near a feature known as Home Plate, a wheel broke through a crust on the planet's surface and started spinning in the soft powder below. Fearful that the rocks could be a hazard to the undercarriage of the rover, the engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory stopped trying to extricate it while they studied the situation with a model in a sandbox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> The strategy on Monday will be to try to drive Spirit out of the pit the way it came in, said Ashley Stroupe, a robotics engineer and rover driver.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Satellite Found Water on Moon, Researchers Say</span>
</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG   </div><div>879 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is water on the Moon, scientists stated unequivocally on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Indeed yes, we found water,'' Anthony Colaprete, the principal investigator for NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, said in a news conference. ''And we didn't find just a little bit. We found a significant amount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The confirmation of scientists' suspicions is welcome news to explorers who might set up home on the lunar surface and to scientists who hope that the water, in the form of ice accumulated over billions of years, holds a record of the solar system's history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite, known as Lcross (pronounced L-cross), crashed into a crater near the Moon's south pole a month ago. The 5,600-miles-per-hour impact carved out a hole 60 to 100 feet wide and kicked up at least 26 gallons of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got more than just a whiff,'' Peter H. Schultz, a professor of geological sciences at Brown University and a co-investigator of the mission, said in a telephone interview. ''We practically tasted it with the impact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade, planetary scientists have seen tantalizing hints of water ice at the bottom of these cold craters where the sun never shines. The Lcross mission, intended to look for water, was made up of two pieces -- an empty rocket stage to slam into the floor of Cabeus, a crater 60 miles wide and 2 miles deep, and a small spacecraft to measure what was kicked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For space enthusiasts who stayed up, or woke up early, to watch the impact on Oct. 9, the event was anticlimactic, even disappointing, as they failed to see the anticipated debris plume. Even some high-powered telescopes on Earth like the Palomar Observatory in California did not see anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration later said that Lcross did indeed photograph a plume but that the live video stream was not properly attuned to pick out the details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water findings came through an analysis of the slight shifts in color after the impact, showing telltale signs of water molecules that had absorbed specific wavelengths of light. ''We got good fits,'' Dr. Colaprete said. ''It was a unique fit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists also saw colors of ultraviolet light associated with molecules of hydroxyl, consisting of one hydrogen and one oxygen, presumably water molecules that had been broken apart by the impact and then glowed like neon signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there were squiggles in the data that indicated other molecules, possibly carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, methane or more complex carbon-based molecules. ''All of those are possibilities,'' Dr. Colaprete said, ''but we really need to do the work to see which ones work best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remaining in perpetual darkness like other craters near the lunar poles, the bottom of Cabeus is a frigid minus 365 degrees Fahrenheit, cold enough that anything at the bottom of such craters never leaves. These craters are ''really like the dusty attic of the solar system,'' said Michael Wargo, the chief lunar scientist at NASA headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moon was once thought to be dry. Then came hints of ice in the polar craters. In September, scientists reported an unexpected finding that most of the surface, not just the polar regions, might be covered with a thin veneer of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lcross scientists said it was not clear how all the different readings of water related to one another, if at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deposits in the lunar craters may be as informative about the Moon as ice cores from Earth's polar regions are about the planet's past climates. Scientists want to know the source and history of whatever water they find. It could have come from the impacts of comets, for instance, or from within the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now that we know that water is there, thanks to Lcross, we can begin in earnest to go to this next set of questions,'' said Gregory T. Delory of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Delory said the findings of Lcross and other spacecraft were ''painting a really surprising new picture of the Moon; rather than a dead and unchanging world, it could be in fact a very dynamic and interesting one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lunar ice, if bountiful, not only gives future settlers something to drink, but could also be broken apart into oxygen and hydrogen. Both are valuable as rocket fuel, and the oxygen would also give astronauts air to breathe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's current exploration plans call for a return of astronauts to the Moon by 2020, for the first visit since 1972. But a panel appointed in May recently concluded that trimmings of the agency's budget made that goal impossible. One option presented to the Obama administration was to bypass Moon landings for now and focus on long-duration missions in deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the signs of water were clear and definitive, the Moon is far from wet. The Cabeus soil could still turn out to be drier than that in deserts on Earth. But Dr. Colaprete also said that he expected that the 26 gallons were a lower limit and that it was too early to estimate the concentration of water in the soil.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttle has often been called a pickup truck to orbit, and the next flight of the shuttle Atlantis, scheduled for launching Monday afternoon, lives up to that description.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis is lugging up to the International Space Station a cargo bay full of spare parts, including a couple of refurbished gyroscopes, pumps, tanks for ammonia and nitrogen and a piece called the ''trailing umbilical system reel assembly'' for the railway system that moves the station's robotic arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are the highest priority spare parts,'' said Eve Stavros, the payload flow manager for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which built the American portions of the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parts, 27,250 pounds in all, are crucial, especially as policy makers look to extend the life of the space station by five years, to 2020. After the space shuttles are retired in about a year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will have no way to take up any large, heavy replacement pieces to the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11-day mission is commanded by Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines, and the pilot is Capt. Barry E. Wilmore of the Navy. The other crew members are Lt. Col. Randolph J. Bresnik of the Marines;. Michael J. Foreman, a retired Navy captain; Leland D. Melvin; and Robert L. Satcher Jr. The mission includes three spacewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole P. Stott, who has spent three months on the space station, will return to Earth with the shuttle crew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shuttle will also bring back part of a balky toilet system that recycles urine into drinkable water. NASA officials said the station has sufficient fresh water for now, and they hope to send replacement parts for the toilet system on a future shuttle flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After this flight, only five shuttle flights remain on the schedule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The countdown, which began Friday, proceeded without incident through the weekend. ''We've had a very clean countdown to date, and are currently on schedule with no problems to report,'' Stephen J. Paine, a shuttle test director, said at a news conference Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasts gave a 90 percent chance of favorable weather for the scheduled 2:28 p.m. launching on Monday from the Kennedy Space Center. The countdown has been so trouble-free that a reporter asked Mr. Paine if he thought the mission was jinxed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll take any good luck we can get,'' Mr. Paine replied. ''And a smooth count is good to have every now and again.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA said last week that the world was not ending -- at least anytime soon. Last year, CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, said the same thing, which I guess is good news for those of us who are habitually jittery. How often do you have a pair of such blue-ribbon scientific establishments assuring us that everything is fine?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, it is kind of depressing if you were looking forward to taking a vacation from mortgage payments to finance one last blowout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CERN's pronouncements were intended to allay concerns that a black hole would be spit out of its new Large Hadron Collider and eat the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcements by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in the form of several Web site postings and a video posted on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, were in response to worries that the world will end on Dec. 21, 2012, when a 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count in the Mayan calendar supposedly comes to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doomsday buzz reached a high point with the release of the new movie ''2012,'' directed by Roland Emmerich, who previously inflicted misery on the Earth from aliens and glaciers in ''Independence Day'' and ''The Day After Tomorrow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the movie, an alignment between the Sun and the center of the galaxy on Dec. 21, 2012, causes the Sun to go berserk with mighty storms on its surface that pour out huge numbers of the elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos. Somehow the neutrinos transmute into other particles and heat up the Earth's core. The Earth's crust loses its moorings and begins to weaken and slide around. Los Angeles falls into the ocean; Yellowstone blows up, showering the continent with black ash. Tidal waves wash over the Himalayas, where the governments of the planet have secretly built a fleet of arks in which a select 400,000 people can ride out the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is only one version of apocalypse out there. In other variations, a planet named Nibiru crashes into us or the Earth's magnetic field flips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are hundreds of books devoted to 2012, and millions of Web sites, depending on what combination of ''2012'' and ''doomsday'' you type into <span class="companylink">Google</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of it, astronomers say, is bunk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of what's claimed for 2012 relies on wishful thinking, wild pseudoscientific folly, ignorance of astronomy and a level of paranoia worthy of 'Night of the Living Dead,' '' Ed Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory, in Los Angeles, and an expert on ancient astronomy, wrote in an article in the November issue of Sky &amp; Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personally, I have been in love with end-of-the-world stories since I started consuming science fiction as a disaffected child. Scaring the pants off the public has been pretty much the name of the game ever since Orson Welles broadcast ''War of the Worlds,'' a fake newscast about a Martian invasion of New Jersey, in 1938.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trend has gone too far, suggested David Morrison, an astronomer at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who made the <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video and is one of the agency's point people on the issue of Mayan prophecies of doom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I get angry at the way people are being manipulated and frightened to make money,'' Dr. Morrison said. ''There is no ethical right to frighten children to make a buck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morrison said he had been getting about 20 letters and e-mail messages a day from people as far away as India scared out of their wits. In an e-mail message, he enclosed a sample that included one from a woman wondering if she should kill herself, her daughter and her unborn baby. Another came from a person pondering whether to put her dog to sleep to avoid suffering in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this reminded me of the kinds of letters I received last year about the putative black hole at CERN. That too was more science fiction than science fact, but apparently there is nothing like death to bring home the abstract realms of physics and astronomy. In such situations, when the Earth or the universe is trying to shrug you and your loved ones off this mortal plane, the cosmic does become personal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Morrison said he did not blame the movie for all this, as much as the many other purveyors of the Mayan prediction, as well as the apparent failure of some people, reflected in so many arenas of our national life, to tell reality from fiction. But then, he said, ''my doctorate is in astronomy, not psychology.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail exchange, Dr. Krupp said: ''We are always uncertain about the future, and we always consume representations of it. We are always lured by the romance of the ancient past and by the exotic scale of the cosmos. When they combine, we are mesmerized.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokesman, Dwayne Brown, said the agency did not comment on movies, leaving that to movie critics. But when it comes to science, Mr. Brown said, ''we felt it was prudent to provide a resource.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to worry, most scientists say, you should think about global climate change, rogue asteroids or nuclear war. But if speculation about ancient prophecies gets you going, here are some things Dr. Morrison and the others think you should know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, astronomers agree, there is nothing special about the Sun and galactic center aligning in the sky. It happens every December with no physical consequences beyond the overconsumption of eggnog. And anyway, the Sun and the galactic center will not exactly coincide even in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there were another planet out there heading our way, everybody could see it by now. As for those fierce solar storms, the next sunspot maximum will not happen until 2013, and will be on the mild side, astronomers now say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geological apocalypse is a better bet. There have been big earthquakes in California before and probably will be again. These quakes could destroy Los Angeles, as shown in the movie, and Yellowstone could erupt again with cataclysmic force sooner or later. We and our works are indeed fragile and temporary riders on the Earth. But in this case, ''sooner or later'' means hundreds of millions of years, and there would be plenty of warning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mayans, who were good-enough astronomers and timekeepers to predict Venus's position 500 years in the future, deserve better than this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayan time was cyclic, and experts like Dr. Krupp and Anthony Aveni, an astronomer and anthropologist at Colgate University, say there is no evidence that the Mayans thought anything special would happen when the odometer rolled over on this Long Count in 2012. There are references in Mayan inscriptions to dates both before the beginning and the ending of the present Long Count, they say, just as your next birthday and April 15 loom beyond New Year's Eve, on next year's calendar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So keep up those mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GRAPHIC: THE LONG COUNT: The Maya reckoned time in various cycles, ranging from several days to thousands of years in length. Important historical dates were typically noted using the Long Count, a repeating 5,125-year cycle of 13 bak'tuns, each about 394 years long. In three years the current cycle, which began in 3114 B.C., will end, and another cycle of bak'tuns will begin. (Note: Many scholars use a different modern date correlation, which differs by two days.) (Sources: Michael D. Coe and Mark Van Stone,''Reading the Maya Glyphs'') (DRAWINGS BY MARK VAN STONE) (pg.D4)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The shuttle Atlantis vaulted into orbit on Monday and set off after the International Space Station, carrying 15 tons of spare parts and equipment as a hedge against failures after the shuttle fleet is retired next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're looking for the long-term outfitting of station,'' said the shuttle commander, Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Colonel Hobaugh and Capt. Barry E. Wilmore, a Navy pilot, at the controls, Atlantis's twin solid-fuel boosters ignited with a blast of fire at 2:28 p.m., instantly pushing the winged spacecraft away from Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wheeling about to line up on a northeasterly trajectory, Atlantis accelerated through a partly cloudy sky, on course for a docking with the space station around noon Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joining Colonel Hobaugh and Captain Wilmore for the 11-day mission were Michael J. Foreman, a retired Navy captain; Lt. Col. Randolph J. Bresnik of the Marines; Leland D. Melvin, an expert in materials testing (and a former pro football draft pick); and Dr. Robert L. Satcher Jr., an orthopedic surgeon with a doctorate in chemical engineering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be the first shuttle flight for Captain Wilmore, Dr. Satcher and Colonel Bresnik, whose wife is scheduled to deliver the couple's second child, a girl, during the mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary goal of the 129th shuttle flight is to deliver critical spares to the space station that are too large to be launched on the European, Japanese and Russian cargo ships that will be used to support the outpost after the shuttle is retired next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mounted on twin pallets in Atlantis's payload bay are two spare gyroscopes, used to control the space station's orientation in space, a high-pressure oxygen tank for the lab's airlock, and a spare pump module, ammonia coolant and nitrogen that will be needed at some point by the station's cooling system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other components include a spare mechanical-hand-like appendage for the station's robot arm, a power cable spool used by the arm's mobile transporter, a solar array battery charge-discharge unit and a device designed to prevent electrical arcing that could pose a threat to spacewalkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlantis astronauts also plan to bring a space station flight engineer, Nicole P. Stott back to Earth after three months in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be the last shuttle mission to carry a crew member to or from the space station. Until a shuttle replacement starts flying in five to seven years, American, European, Canadian and Japanese astronauts will ride Russian Soyuz capsules to the station, paying $50 million per seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well, the Atlantis astronauts will celebrate Thanksgiving in space and land back at the Kennedy Space Center on Nov. 27.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past four months, NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which is in a low polar orbit over the Moon, has returned a series of images of Apollo landing sites showing the vessels themselves at rest on the Moon's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent of these, released last week, is a high-resolution view of the first manned landing site where Apollo 11 touched down on July 20, 1969. On the right are the bright, stony rays of West Crater, and at the left edge of the photograph is the lower stage of the lunar module itself, gleaming like a pinpoint of light on the gray, cratered plain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mission of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is loaded with instruments, is to produce a new and vastly sharper glimpse of the Moon from an orbit about 30 miles above the surface -- all with an eye toward a possible manned return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there's something terribly wistful about these photographs of the Apollo landing sites. The detail is such that if Neil Armstrong were walking there now, we could make him out, make out his footsteps even, like the astronaut footpath clearly visible in the photos of the Apollo 14 site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the wistfulness is caused by the sense of simple grandeur in those Apollo missions. Perhaps, too, it's a reminder of the risk we all felt after the Eagle had landed -- the possibility that it might be unable to lift off again and the astronauts would be stranded on the Moon. But it may also be that a photograph like this one is as close as we're able to come to looking directly back into the human past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There the lunar module sits, parked just where it landed 40 years ago, as if it still really were 40 years ago and all the time since merely imaginary.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA rover Spirit, stuck in sand on Mars, tried to move Tuesday for the first time since May. In less than a second, it stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cautious mission managers had put tight constraints on the Spirit's movement to ensure that it did not drive itself into a deeper predicament. Because the uncertainty in its tilt was more than one degree, the rover called it a day. Spirit awaits new instructions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The engineers are ''still analyzing that result before they decide what to do with the next drive,'' said Guy Webster, a spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., which operates the Spirit and another rover, Opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commands to the rover were for it to make two forward motions, rotating its wheels three revolutions each time. If the rover were on solid ground, that would have carried it about five yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have said they will give the rover managers until at least February to try to pull the Spirit out of the sand trap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least the rover has been stuck in an interesting place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One side sits on basaltic sand mixed with iron oxide dust, typical for most of Mars. The other side is sunk in sands rich in minerals known as sulfates, which tell of an era long ago when acidic waters flowed in this region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This turns out to be a geologic treasure trove,'' said Raymond E. Arvidson, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at Washington University at St. Louis and the mission's deputy principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sands are richer in sulfates than anywhere else measured so far by the Spirit or the Opportunity, which is on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's really interesting,'' Dr. Arvidson said, ''is the material is layered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The layers vary in appearance and composition, perhaps a result of climatic changes in the geologically recent past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mars's axis periodically tips over, leading to colder temperatures and snowfall near the equator. Sunlight shining through the ice and snow could have heated the ground and melted ice, and the water then dissolved and washed away some of the sulfates, producing the layers. The grains in the top few sulfate layers were cemented together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spirit drilled two small holes into the surface. In one hole, the drill broke through to sulfate sands. In the other hole, about four inches away, there were no signs of sulfates at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are sitting astride a geologic boundary,'' Dr. Arvidson said. ''It goes right down the middle of the rover.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rock may be touching the bottom of the rover, which could further complicate the possibility of escape. Also, the rover is tilted toward the side, toward the interior of the crater, and one of the six wheels malfunctioned several years ago and no longer turns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In six months of testing, said John Callas, the project manager, ''we have not been able to demonstrate a path to extrication.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Callas remains hopeful, though, because Mars is considerably different from Earth, with about one-third the gravity and almost no moisture in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even if the rover never gets out, its scientific value could continue as a weather and seismic monitoring station. The rover has outlived its original three-month mission by more than five and a half years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity, meanwhile, continues to make steady progress toward a giant crater where scientists hope to explore geologic layers farther into Mars's past. That destination is still about six miles away, or at least another year of traveling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moffett Field, Calif. -- PICTURE a habitat atop a hill in warm sunlight on the edge of a crater near the south pole of the Moon. There are metal ores in the rocks nearby and water ice in the shadows of the crater below. Solar arrays are set up on the regolith that covers the Moon's surface. Humans live in sealed, cave-like lava tubes, protected from solar flares and sustained by large surface greenhouses. Imagine the Moon as the first self-sustainable human settlement away from Earth and a high-speed transportation hub for the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can finally begin to think seriously about establishing such a self-sufficient home on the Moon because last week, NASA announced that it had discovered large quantities of water there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While we have known for decades that the Moon had all the raw chemicals necessary for sustaining life, we believed they were trapped in rocks and thus difficult to extract. The discovery of plentiful lunar water is of tremendous importance to humanity and our long-term survival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been 73 missions, manned and unmanned, to the Moon, and understanding its chemical composition, particularly finding water, has always been a priority. So why haven't we seen significant amounts of water until now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer lies in the Moon's rotation. Unlike Earth, which rotates on a significant tilt to the Sun, the Moon is barely tilted at all. At the poles, some hills remain in permanent sunlight while some troughs are always in shadow. When water lands in sunny spots, perhaps carried by comets or asteroids, the water transforms directly into gas; if it lands in shadow, the water freezes and can remain indefinitely. The lack of light explains why spectrometers -- instruments that can be used for remote water detection but rely on reflected light to do so -- never picked up on the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This changed last month, when NASA shot a satellite into a permanently shadowed region on the Moon's surface, throwing a plume of material containing water up out of the shadow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the perspective of human space exploration, that water is the most important scientific discovery since the '60s. We can drink it, grow food with it and breathe it -- by separating the oxygen from the hydrogen through a process called electrolysis. These elements can even be used to fuel rocket engines. (Discovering water on Mars was not quite as significant because the major hurdle to establishing permanent settlements there is the eight-month journey.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating a permanent lunar habitat is important primarily for our species' survival. Humanity needs more than one home because, with all our eggs in one basket, we are at risk of low-probability but high-consequence catastrophes like asteroid strikes, nuclear war or bioterrorism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it would also lead to valuable technological and other advancements. Consider the side-effects of the Apollo program: it drove the development of small computers, doubled the number of doctoral students in science and math in about a decade and marked a new stage in relations between the Americans and Soviets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine what we could learn from living on the Moon permanently. On its far side, shielded from the Earth's radio noise, there is a quiet zone perfect for radio astronomy -- which allows us to see objects we can't from Earth. Out of necessity we could develop bacteria to extract resources directly from the regolith -- a useful technology for Earth as well. And an international venture could open a new era of global cooperation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost as surprising as NASA's announcement is the lack of attention it has received. Thirty years ago, a development like this would have been heralded as one of humanity's greatest discoveries. Perhaps the indifference is partly because of the disappointment of astronomers, amateur and professional, who tried to watch NASA's October blast through their telescopes, but couldn't see the plume. Or perhaps it's a symptom of our age, that the problems that bedevil us on Earth limit our interest in other worlds -- just when we need them (and the inspiration they offer) most.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The shuttle Atlantis glided to a flawless Florida landing on Friday, wrapping up an 11-day space station delivery mission and bringing a flight engineer, Nicole P. Stott, back to Earth after 91 days in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dropping out of a clear sky, the shuttle was guided to a tire-smoking touchdown at 9:44 a.m. by the commander, Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines, and the pilot, Capt. Barry E. Wilmore of the Navy -- the final chapter in a 4.4-million-mile voyage that began with blastoff on Nov. 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was a picture-perfect end to a top-fuel mission to the space station,'' Capt. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Navy radioed from mission control at the Johnson Space Center, in Houston. ''Everybody, welcome back to Earth, especially you, Nicole.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launched on Aug. 28 aboard the shuttle Discovery, Ms. Stott made the trip home resting on her back in a recumbent seat on the shuttle Atlantis's lower deck to ease her readaptation to gravity. She was helped off the orbiter by flight surgeons and escorted to crew quarters for medical checks and a reunion with her husband and 7-year-old son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from seeing her family, Ms. Stott said her top priorities were consuming pizza and her first soft drink in three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stott, Colonel Hobaugh, Captain Wilmore and the others who were on the Atlantis --Leland D. Melvin; Michael J. Foreman, a retired Navy captain; Lt. Col. Randolph J. Bresnik of the Marines; and Dr. Robert L. Satcher Jr., an orthopedic surgeon with a doctorate in chemical engineering -- planned to fly back to Houston on Saturday. For Colonel Bresnik, it will be his chance to meet his second child, a baby girl born last Saturday a few hours after he made his first spacewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts delivered nearly 15 tons of equipment and spare parts to the International Space Station to protect against failures after the shuttle fleet is retired. They also staged three spacewalks to prepare the outpost for the arrival of a new module on the next shuttle flight, in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans five more shuttle flights to the space station before retiring the fleet next fall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- Richard Branson, the British billionaire, will unveil a craft on Monday that could soon carry tourists on a trip into space for $200,000 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The craft, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, will make its debut on the moonlike landscape of the Mojave desert between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SpaceShipTwo, which can carry six passengers and two pilots, is scheduled to begin test flights next year and start commercial flights in 2011 or 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virgin Galactic, owned by Mr. Branson's <span class="companylink">Virgin Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Aabar Investments</span> of Abu Dhabi, says about 300 people from around the world have paid a total of $40 million in deposits to guarantee spots on the carbon composite aircraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aerospace experts are already bidding on suborbital flights as the next generation of business travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Hurley-Moser, owner of Hurley Travel Experts in Portland, Ore., is among 50 travel consultants chosen as accredited space agents for Virgin Galactic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But space tourism, for now, remains an exclusive experience reserved for those willing to pay the hefty fee for a seat on the two-and-a-half-hour flights about 60 miles above Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''First a few will go to space, but ultimately, over the next hundred years or so, spaceflight will become commonplace,'' said Charles Chafer, chief executive of Space Services, a Houston company that specializes in space funerals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the company released into space the ashes of the actor James Doohan of ''Star Trek.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Space Services spokeswoman, Susan Schonfeld, said the company now takes the ashes of hundreds of people at a time into space, compared with 27 people in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Through the years, I have had the opportunity to speak to hundreds and hundreds of people from all over the world,'' she said, ''but 99 percent of the people are everyday people like myself that have a very deep sense of exploration I do believe is in all of us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The WhiteKnightTwo mothership, which has a wingspan of 140 feet, is intended to carry the smaller SpaceShipTwo 50,000 feet into the sky before it detaches and shoots up to the edge of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, the tourists could experience five minutes of weightlessness in a cabin with circular windows on the sides and the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chafer predicted, ''As humanity eventually moves to other planets and bodies throughout the solar system, we will of course fly into -- and eventually live in -- space.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the light from stars and other objects like planets in the universe is doubly invisible. It comes in the form of infrared, or heat radiation, with wavelengths too long for our eyes to pick up. Moreover, most infrared wavelengths do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere to get to our unseeing eyes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So to take a proper inventory of cosmic shenanigans, astronomers have had to take to space. On Friday, they will get a little more help when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is scheduled to launch the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California as early as 9:09 a.m., Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circling the Earth in a polar orbit 300 miles high, the spacecraft, equipped with a 16-inch telescope and infrared detectors, will photograph the entire sky every six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WISE is a successor to the Infrared Astronomy Satellite, or IRAS, which was launched in 1983 and made the first heat maps of the sky. And it is a trailblazer for the giant James Webb Space Telescope due in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whereas IRAS had 62 pixels in its camera, WISE has 4 million, said Edward L. Wright of the University of California, Los Angeles, principal investigator for the spacecraft. As a result, WISE will be hundreds of times as sensitive as its predecessor and able to survey a vastly larger volume of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wright said he and his colleagues expected to see millions of new infrared sources, including ultraluminous galaxies that are breeding stars copiously inside shrouds of dust, and a thousand of the cool almost-stars known as brown dwarfs, which are bigger than Jupiter but too small to ignite thermonuclear reactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should find out how many old, cold brown dwarfs are out there,'' Dr. Wright said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other prime targets include asteroids, especially so-called near-Earth objects that might one day pose a threat to civilization. The WISE astronomers hope to measure the diameters of hundreds of thousands of asteroids to get a better sense of how dangerous they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wright said the project had been almost 12 years in the making and cost $320 million, including operations and launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we hope to do is find the most interesting objects for next-generation telescopes to look at,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we don't find something totally unexpected,'' he added, ''I'll be surprised.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it Steam World.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers said Wednesday that they had discovered a planet composed mostly of water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You would not want to live there. Besides the heat -- 400 degrees Fahrenheit on the ocean surface -- the planet is probably cloaked in a dark fog of superheated steam and other gases. But its discovery has encouraged a growing feeling among astronomers that they are on the verge of a breakthrough and getting closer to finding a planet that something could live on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This probably is not habitable, but it didn't miss the habitable zone by that much,'' said David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led the team that discovered the new planet and will reports its findings on Thursday in the journal Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geoffrey W. Marcy, a planet hunter from the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an accompanying article in Nature that the new work provided ''the most watertight evidence so far for a planet that is something like our own Earth, outside our solar system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 2.7 times the size of Earth and 6.6 times as massive, the new planet takes 38 hours to circle a dim red star, GJ 1214, in the constellation Ophiuchus -- about 40 light-years from here. It is one of the lightest and smallest so-called extrasolar planets yet found, part of a growing class of planets that are less than 10 times the mass of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charbonneau's announcement capped a week in which the list of known planets, including these ''super-Earths,'' grew significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An international team of astronomers using telescopes in Australia and Hawaii reported in one paper that they had found three planets, including a super-Earth, orbiting 61 Virginis, a star in the constellation Virgo that is almost a clone of the Sun. In a separate paper, they reported finding a planet somewhat larger than Jupiter at the star 23 Librae. It was the first time, they said, that a super-Earth had been found belonging to a star like the Sun; the other home stars have been dwarfs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in yet another paper, a subset of the same group reported finding a super-Earth and probably two bigger planets circling HD 1461, a star in Cetus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who was involved in all three papers, said astronomers thought that one-third to one-half of all Sun-like stars harbored such super-Earths orbiting at scorching distances much closer than Mercury is to the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 15 years since the first extrasolar planet was found, more than 400 have been detected. The field is getting more intense as dedicated planet-hunting instruments like the Kepler satellite from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, due to report a new batch of such planets next month, get into the game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan P. Boss, a planetary theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said of the planet hunters, ''Give them a couple more years and they're going to knock your socks off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charbonneau's planet, only 1.3 million miles from its home star, is distinguished by its relative coolness -- a consequence of the dimness of GJ 1214, which puts out one three-hundredth of the Sun's energy. He and his colleagues had set out to search for planets around such stars, noting that they are more numerous and that it is easier to discern planets around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His planet-hunting equipment is a bank of eight telescopes called MEarth, pronounced ''mirth,'' on Mount Hopkins in Arizona. Each telescope is only 16 inches in diameter, no bigger than those that grace the backyard of many amateur astronomers. They monitor the light of 2,000 nearby stars, looking for the regular blips caused when a planet passes by, or transits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Zachory Berta, a first-year graduate student of Dr. Charbonneau, called the group's attention to blips in the Ophiuchus star that seemed to be happening every 1.6 days. If he was right, Mr. Berta said, the next transit would occur at 6 a.m. on May 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charbonneau was in Washington later that day preparing for a State Department dinner when he got a group e-mail message that began: ''We have a winner. Congrats Zach!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the drop in starlight, the astronomers could calculate the diameter of the Ophiuchus planet, known now as GJ 1214b. Then they used a sensitive spectrograph on a 3.6-meter telescope in Chile to measure its gravitational tug on the star, thus deriving the planet's mass. Using those two numbers, Dr. Charbonneau and his colleagues could calculate the density of the planet, about one-third that of Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we probably have here is a water world,'' Dr. Charbonneau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Charbonneau said the weight of the new planet's presumptive atmosphere kept the water liquid rather than just boiling into space. He acknowledged that a different recipe, with more rock and a very puffy atmosphere, would also fit the data. That is unlikely, he and other planet experts say, but the steam-world theory may be soon tested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new planet is close enough to be studied directly by telescopes on or near Earth. Indeed, Dr. Charbonneau said his team had already applied for observing time on the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our own TV signals,'' he said, ''have already passed this star.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saratoga, Calif. -- IN Silicon Valley we have a saying: launch early, launch often. It's an acknowledgment that successful, innovative companies are the ones that rapidly try new ideas, see what works, improve their products and repeat. Businesses that launch frequently are also able to take advantage of economies of scale to make launchings faster and easier. In many ways, the key to innovation is speed of execution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA, an agency that depends on innovation, could benefit from the same mindset. To meet its new goals for human spaceflight, NASA must be able to be creative and take risks, or else it will be unable to adapt to new technology and changing political realities. Grand plans stretching over decades will become irrelevant and eventually collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 years before I left NASA in 2007, we averaged about four space shuttle launchings per year. We had periods when the rate was even lower: in the late '90s, during the early construction phase of the International Space Station, and in 2003, in the wake of the space shuttle Columbia disaster. I saw firsthand the harm that low launching rates do to innovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With precious few flights, every available opportunity to test new equipment or run scientific investigations was filled for years into the future, and this discouraged engineers from trying out new ideas. Without actual flight test data on, for example, prototypes for new life-support equipment, management was forced to substitute analysis for real engineering experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As operations slowed, morale dropped and proficiency in mission control, hardware handling and other operations all declined. The space shuttle is a magnificent machine, but it is so expensive and difficult to maintain that most of NASA's effort was aimed at simply getting things up, so there were few resources left for actually exploring space. Imagine how different it would have been if we had had regular weekly launchings!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an important distinction to be made between the launching system (the rocket), and the spacecraft and payload (scientific instruments, experiments, people and so on) that it carries. In planning for spaceflight, the goal should be to make the launching system as robust as possible, and then launch rockets frequently so you can experiment and improve on the spacecraft and payloads that carry out missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I recognize that NASA cannot push a system to launch more frequently than it is capable of, because this could mean overrunning the budget or, worse, cutting corners on safety. Instead, future systems should be designed so that they can be rapidly prepared for launching by small teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This would not only increase NASA's ability to send up innovative payloads but also make launching systems more reliable. After all, the more a rocket is flown, the better it can be understood and the safer it becomes. Frequent launchings would also reduce costs per flight in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This strategy does have a downside: Given the reality of fixed budgets, a requirement to launch frequently would push designers to create smaller rockets. So any large spacecraft would need to be assembled and fueled in space, rather than on the ground. But if the flight rate is high and the launching system is robust, then such complications could be overcome. If, on the other hand, NASA is able to launch rockets only a few times a year, it will be difficult to maintain the innovation needed to sustain any long-term program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian Soyuz rocket demonstrates the value of frequent launching. Variants of this rocket have flown more than 1,700 times, averaging more than 30 launchings a year. As a result, the Soyuz is among the most reliable of all existing rockets. In fact, I flew into space aboard a Soyuz rocket in 2003 when NASA space shuttles had been grounded after the Columbia disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no reason American companies could not build a similar, but modernized, medium-sized, economical workhorse of a rocket that is simple enough to sustain frequent launching. If NASA were to promise to buy one such rocket a week, the manufacturers could also profitably sell copies for launching commercial spacecraft and satellites -- at much lower than current prices -- and this would spur the development of space-based industries in fields like telecommunications, earth imaging and even space tourism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To maintain a vibrant, innovative program, NASA needs to step up the rate of rocket launchings. It should set a requirement that any new launching system fly once a week, then put out contracts for private companies to design and build rockets that can operate this frequently. By launching early and launching often, NASA could get back in the business of exploring space.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was asked recently what the Large Hadron Collider, the giant particle accelerator outside Geneva, is good for. After $10 billion and 15 years, the machine is ready to begin operations early next year, banging together protons in an effort to recreate the conditions of the Big Bang. Sure, there are new particles and abstract symmetries in the offing for those few who speak the language of quantum field theory. But what about the rest of us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classic answer was allegedly given long ago by Michael Faraday, who, when asked what good was electricity, told a government minister that he didn't know but that ''one day you will tax it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not being fast enough on my feet, I rattled off the usual suspects. Among the spinoffs from particle physics, besides a robust academic research community, are the Web, which was invented as a tool for physicists to better communicate at CERN -- the European Organization for Nuclear Research, builders of the new collider -- and many modern medical imaging methods like M.R.I.'s and PET scans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These tests sound innocuous and even miraculous: noninvasive and mostly painless explorations of personal inner space, but their use does involve an encounter with forces that sound like they came from the twilight zone. When my wife, Nancy, had a scan known as a Spect last fall, for what seems to have been a false alarm, she had to be injected with a radioactive tracer. That meant she had to sleep in another room for a couple of days and was forbidden to hug our daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''P'' in PET scan, after all, stands for positron, as in the particles that are opposites to the friendly workhorse, the electron, which is to say antimatter, the weird stuff of science-fiction dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't know if anyone ever asked Paul Dirac, the British physicist who predicted the existence of antimatter, whether it would ever be good for anything. Some people are now saying that the overuse of scanning devices has helped bankrupt the health care system. Indeed, when I saw the bill for Nancy's scan, I almost fainted, but when I saw how little of it we ourselves had to pay, I felt like ordering up Champagne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But better medical devices are not why we build these machines that eat a small city's worth of electricity to bang together protons and recreate the fires of the Big Bang. Better diagnoses are not why young scientists spend the best years of their lives welding and soldering and pulling cable through underground caverns inside detectors the size of New York apartment buildings to capture and record those holy fires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They want to know where we all came from, and so do I. In a drawer at home I have a family tree my brother made as a school project long ago tracing our ancestry back several hundred years in Norway, but it's not enough. Whatever happened in the Big Bang, whatever laws are briefly reincarnated in the unholy proton fires at CERN, not only made galaxies and planets possible, but it also made us possible. How atoms could achieve such a thing is a story mostly untold but worth revering. The Earth's biosphere is the most complicated manifestation of the laws of nature that we know of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like an only child dreaming of lost siblings, we dream of finding other Earths, other creatures and civilizations out in space, or even other universes. We all want to find out that we are cosmic Anastasias and that there is a secret that connects us, that lays bare the essential unity of physical phenomena.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so we try, sometimes against great odds. The year that is now ending began with some areas of science in ruins. One section of the Large Hadron Collider looked like a train wreck with several-ton magnets lying about smashed after an electrical connection between them vaporized only nine days off a showy inauguration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble Space Telescope was limping about in orbit with only one of its cameras working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here is the scorecard at the end of the year: in December, the newly refurbished collider produced a million proton collisions, including 50,000 at the record energy of 1.2 trillion electron volts per proton, before going silent for the holidays. CERN is on track to run it next year at three times that energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hubble telescope, after one last astronaut servicing visit, reached to within spitting distance of the Big Bang and recorded images of the most distant galaxies yet observed, which existed some 600 million or 700 million years after the putative beginning of time</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention the rapidly expanding universe of extrasolar planets. In my view from the cosmic bleachers, the pot is bubbling for discovery. We all got a hint of just how crazy that might be in the new age of the Internet on Dec. 17, when physicists around the world found themselves glued to a Webcast of the results from an experiment called the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search. Rumors had swept the blogs and other outposts of scientific commentary that the experimenters were going to announce that they had finally detected the ethereal and mysterious dark matter particles, which, astronomers say, make up a quarter of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the result was frustratingly vague and inconclusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want it to be true -- we so want to have a clue about dark matter,'' Maria Spiropulu, a Caltech physicist working at CERN wrote to me the night of the Webcast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And it is not easy,'' Dr. Spiropulu said. ''The experiments are not easy and the analysis is not easy. This is a tough, tough ride over all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although we might well solve part of the dark matter conundrum in the coming years, the larger mystery winds out in front of us like a train snaking into the fog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We may never know where we came from. We will probably never find that cosmic connection to our lost royalty. Someday I will visit Norway and look up those ancestors. They died not knowing the fate of the universe, and so will I, but maybe that's all right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Weinberg, a University of Texas physicist and Nobel Prize winner, once wrote in his 1977 book ''The First Three Minutes'': ''The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.'' Dr. Weinberg has been explaining that statement ever since. He went on to say that it is by how we live and love and, yes, do science, that the universe warms up and acquires meaning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the dark matter fever was rising a few weeks ago, I called Vera Rubin, the astronomer at the department of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who helped make dark matter a cosmic issue by showing that galaxies rotate too fast for the gravity of their luminous components to keep them together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Dr. Rubin, who likes to stick to the facts, refused to be excited. ''I don't know if we have dark matter or have to nudge Newton's Laws or what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sorry I know so little; I'm sorry we all know so little. But that's kind of the fun, isn't it?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOSCOW -- Russia's top space researchers will hold a closed-door meeting to plan a mission to deflect 99942 Apophis, an asteroid that will fly close to Earth two decades from now, said Anatoly N. Perminov, the head of Russia's space agency, during an interview on Russian radio on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perminov said Apophis, named for the Egyptian god of destruction, is about three times the size of the Tunguska meteorite, apparently the cause of a 1908 explosion in Siberia that knocked over an estimated 80 million trees. He said that according to his experts' calculation, there was still time to design a spacecraft that could alter Apophis's path before it made a dangerous swing toward Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't remember exactly, but it seems to me it could hit the Earth by 2032,'' he said, adding, ''We're talking about people's lives here. It's better to spend several million dollars and create this system, which would not allow a collision to happen, than wait for it to happen and kill hundreds of thousands of people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Apophis's chances of hitting Earth have been downgraded since it was discovered in 2004, NASA said this year. Scientists originally thought the orbit of the 1,000-foot-long asteroid gave it a 2.7 percent chance of hitting Earth on its first approach in 2029, but after studying its path they said it would remain 18,300 miles above the planet's surface.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a second approach, in 2036, it was originally given a 1-in-45,000 chance of hitting Earth, but the odds were reduced to 1 in 250,000. The odds of impact on its third approach, in 2068, are 1 in 333,000, NASA scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have proposed various methods of averting an asteroid impact, among them a spacecraft that would land on the asteroid and, using electric motors, very gradually turn its trajectory. Another method would involve striking it with missiles or employing a satellite that used gravitational pull to change the orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perminov said the plan he envisioned would involve ''no nuclear explosions; everything will be based on the laws of physics.'' Once a mission has been developed, Russia will invite NASA, the China Space Agency and the European Space Agency to participate, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russell L. Schweickart, a former Apollo astronaut who is chairman of the B612 Foundation, a California group that promotes efforts to deflect asteroids, hailed much of the proposal and said Mr. Perminov was the most influential official ever to articulate a coordinated deflection plan. But he objected to using Apophis to test new deflection methods, saying there was more risk if something went wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes a very small change in the Apophis orbit to cause it to impact the Earth instead of missing it,'' Mr. Schweickart said. ''There are a million asteroids out there. Find another one.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine the cosmos. What do you picture? A great void extending infinitely in all directions, sparsely dotted by stars, planets and other heavenly bodies, booby-trapped by black holes and traversed by light rays and magnetic fields? If you are a modern secularist that might be what you envision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what if you were a 16th-century Hindu? You might imagine a universe populated by gods, demons, monsters and other supernatural beings. You would behold great castles, paradisical gardens and wilderness landscapes where stories of creation, love, sex, birth, initiation, war, death and resurrection are set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This dichotomy is the subject of ''Visions of the Cosmos: From the Milky Ocean to an Evolving Universe'' at the Rubin Museum of Art. The show of 75 works is too modest to do justice to its enormous theme, but its juxtaposition of Western science and Eastern religion sets up a thought-provoking compare-contrast exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One conclusion you might draw is that when it comes to inspiring visual art, Eastern cosmology has the advantage. This is misleading. While the Eastern side displays many captivating works of painting, sculpture and drawing representing Hindu, Buddhist and Jainist perspectives in sensuous detail, the European ideas are mostly in the form of printed illustrations in antique books, with astronomical photographs of the heavens taken by the Hubble space telescope and other high-tech machines representing current knowledge of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The selection serves mainly to show how Western cosmology evolved in response to increasingly accurate empirical observation. First we thought the Earth was still the center of the universe. Then we discovered that we were actually orbiting the Sun. Then we learned that our solar system was just a tiny blip on the universal radar screen. Meanwhile astrologists and alchemists theorized about magical correspondences between the stars and events on the ground, paving the way for the more credible sciences of astronomy and chemistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally we found ourselves adrift in the infinite, godless universe of modern science represented in the exhibition by a short, digital simulation produced by the American Museum of Natural History. It starts with a satellite picture of the Himalayas and draws back for progressively more distant, expansive views: the whole Earth, the solar system, the Milky Way and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no reason the West's picture of the universe cannot inspire great art, but it is not likely to precipitate the visual and metaphorical extravagance that the East's does. There is no comparison between a garishly colorful, digital abstraction representing the Big Bang theory and ''Vishnu Sleeping on the Cosmic Ocean,'' an 11th-century sandstone sculpture representing the Creation. It shows Vishnu, the source of all existence, stirred from dormancy to a ''pouring forth'' of forms by a foot massage administered by his consort Lakshmi. Secularists might envy a worldview that conceives the origin of the universe in such sweetly erotic terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eastern side includes pseudoscientific diagrams similar to those in the old Western tomes. With their gridded number charts, astrological and magical notations and concentric circles symbolizing different dimensions of being, they give off a numinous vibe. But they do not represent an evolution of understanding that the West would recognize as scientific. It is more reasonable to think of Eastern cosmology as a projection of consciousness, the various elements of which are vigorously personified. That the male principal should be stimulated to productive action by the touch of the female principal, as in the sandstone Vishnu sculpture, says more about poetic imagination than about anything empirically verifiable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Eastern cosmology is not constrained by science it is freer to give fantastic answers to big questions like how the world began and where it might be going. Its mythic scenarios come from publicly shared traditions, but they can have an almost surrealistic, dreamlike effect. Three small gouaches (two from the late 1600s and one from about 1785) representing a creation story called ''The Churning of the Milky Ocean'' are marvels of miniaturist craft and psychologically arresting image making. In each a team of demons and a team of gods play tug of war, pulling the ends of a giant snake whose middle wraps around a phallic-shaped mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the opponents exert themselves, the mountain, supported by an underwater tortoise, rotates and churns up treasures and magic elixirs from the oceanic depths. It surely is not much of a leap to see this as a metaphor about consciousness arising from tensions between psychologically opposed energies like those of the id and the superego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if anything the small, mid-18th-century painting of Krishna Vishvarupa, who has dozens of heads and scores of arms and legs, says about the nature of reality is hard to determine, but it is certainly a striking image of pluralistic consciousness and divine omniscience. And while the hierarchical architecture of a nearly 6-foot-tall, 11th-century copper stupa -- a Buddhist reliquary -- may offer a useful way to imagine a spiritual order, its value as a model of reality is doubtful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Close study and creative interpretation may reveal surprising parallels between Eastern and Western cosmologies. Both have entertained theories of multiple realities, for example. But while Eastern cosmologists envision the enchanted inner world of mental experience, Westerners map the disenchanted outer realm of material reality. Only a wedding of the two perspectives -- a marriage of the yin and the yang -- is ever likely to yield a complete picture of the cosmos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the universe there is always room for another surprise. Or two. Or a trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the Witch Head Nebula, for example -- a puffy purplish trail of gas in the constellation Eridanus. When a picture of it is turned on its side, the nebula looks just like, well, a witch, complete with a pointy chin and peaked hat, ready to jump on a broomstick or offer an apple to Snow White.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 30 years of covering astronomy, I had never heard of the Witch Head Nebula until I came across a haunting two-page spread showing it snaking across an inky black star-speckled background in ''Far Out: A Space-Time Chronicle,'' an exquisite picture guide to the universe by Michael Benson, a photographer, journalist and filmmaker, and obviously a longtime space buff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually ''exquisite'' does not really do justice to the aesthetic and literary merits of the book, published in the fall. I live in New York, so most of the cosmos is invisible to me, but even when I lived under the black crystalline and -- at this time of year -- head-ringingly cold skies of the Catskills, I could see only so far. If you don't have your own Hubble Space Telescope, this book is the next best thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson has scoured images from the world's observatories, including the Hubble, to fashion a step-by-step tour of the cosmos, outward from fantastical clusters and nebulae a few hundred light-years away to soft red dots of primordial galaxies peppering the wall of the sky billions of light-years beyond the stars, almost to the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is an art book befitting its Abrams imprint. Here are stars packed like golden sand, gas combed in delicate blue threads, piled into burgundy thunderheads and carved into sinuous rilles and ribbons, and galaxies clotted with star clusters dancing like spiders on the ceiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benson has reprocessed many of the images to give them colors truer to physical reality. For example, in the NASA version of the Hubble's ''Pillars of Creation,'' showing fingers of gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula boiling away to reveal new stars, the ''pillars'' are brown and the radiation burning them away is green; Mr. Benson has turned it into a composition in shades of red, including burgundy, the actual color of the ionized hydrogen that makes the nebula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can sit and look through this book for hours and never be bored by the shapes, colors and textures into which cosmic creation can arrange itself, or you can actually read the accompanying learned essays. Mr. Benson's prose is up to its visual surroundings, no mean feat.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE did humankind come from?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're going to ask Zecharia Sitchin, be ready for a ''Planet of the Apes'' scenario: spaceships and hieroglyphics, genetic mutations and mutinous space aliens in gold mines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds like science fiction, but Mr. Sitchin is sure this is how it all went down hundreds of thousands of years ago in Mesopotamia. Humans were genetically engineered by extraterrestrials, he said, pointing to ancient texts to prove it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Sitchin's Upper West Side kitchen, evolution and creationism collide. He is an apparently sane, sharp, University of London-educated 89-year-old who has spent his life arguing that people evolved with a little genetic intervention from ancient astronauts who came to Earth and needed laborers to mine gold to bring back to Nibiru, a planet we have yet to recognize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlandish, yes, but also somehow intriguing from this cute, distinguished old man whom you may have seen shuffling slowly down Broadway with his cane, and thought, ''Is Art Carney still alive?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you bring your laptop to his kitchen table, as if to take dictation, and ask what to write about him. He pads slowly to the stove and puts on the kettle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well, you could start by calling me the most controversial 89-year-old man in New York,'' Mr. Sitchin says. ''Or you could just say I write books. I understand you've got to have an opening sentence, but describing my theories in a sentence, or even something like a newspaper article, is impossible. It will make me look silly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitchin has been called silly before -- by scientists, historians and archaeologists who dismiss his theories as pseudoscience and fault their underpinnings: his translations of ancient texts and his understanding of physics. And yet, he has a devoted following of readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His 13 books, with names like ''Genesis Revisited'' and ''The Earth Chronicles,'' have sold millions of copies and been translated into 25 languages. ''And Albanian is coming,'' he notes, spooning the Taster's Choice into two mugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitchin himself represents a remarkable feat of urban evolution that often goes unnoticed. He lives alone, in the sprawling prewar apartment he has inhabited for 54 years, maintaining his independence by relying on the infrastructure many Manhattanites take for granted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He works away on his latest book, answers fan mail, and at midday, reaches for his cane, floppy hat and overcoat, and rides the elevator down from the second floor to the lobby. The doorman hails him a cab for the $4 ride to a nearby diner, Cafe Eighty Two on Broadway, for the lunch special, the chicken gyro, where there are other elderly people doing the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper West Side is Mr. Sitchin's Mesopotamia, Broadway a fertile valley. He has Lincoln Center, Zabar's, Fairway, dry cleaners that deliver and a galaxy of take-out restaurants. For research, the New York Public Library is down on 42nd Street, and the archives of the Jewish Theological Seminary up on Broadway at 122nd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Florida, if you don't have a car, you might as well lay down and die,'' he said. ''I've been all over the Western world and I know of no other place where an older person like myself can survive on his own. I raise my hand, and my chauffeured car -- a yellow cab -- takes me anywhere. I can call any restaurant or store and get what I need delivered in minutes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He slides over a cup of coffee in a mug with a 30th anniversary logo for ''The Twelfth Planet,'' his seminal first book, now in its 45th printing. It stated his basic theory, based largely on his reading of texts preserved on clay tablets from the pre-Babylonian era in ancient Mesopotamia, the so-called cradle of the civilization of Sumer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Russia and raised in Israel, Mr. Sitchin studied economics in London and worked as a journalist and editor in Israel before moving to New York in 1952. Here, he was an executive at a shipping company and, with his wife of 66 years (she died in 2007), raised two daughters. He spent his free time studying, leading archaeological tours to ancient sites and spreading his unusual gospel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in childhood, he has studied ancient Hebrew, Akkadian and Sumerian, the language of the ancient Mesopotamians, who brought you geometry, astronomy, the chariot and the lunar calendar. And in the etchings of Sumerian pre-cuneiform script -- the oldest example of writing -- are stories of creation and the cosmos that most consider myth and allegory, but that Mr. Sitchin takes literally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his kitchen, Mr. Sitchin pulled two Danish out of a Zabar's bag and began to explain. It starts with the planet Nibiru, whose long, elliptical orbit brings it near Earth once every 3,600 years or so. The planet's inhabitants were technologically advanced humanlike beings, Mr. Sitchin said, standing about nine feet tall. Some 450,000 years ago, they detected reserves of gold in southeast Africa and made a colonial expedition to Earth, splashing down in what is now the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitchin said these Nibiru-ites recruited laborers from Earth's erect primates to build eight great cities. Enki, who became the Sumerians' god of science, bestowed some of the Nibiru-ites' advanced genetic makeup upon these bipeds so they could work as miners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is how Mr. Sitchin explains what scientists attribute to evolution. He says the aliens' cities were washed away in a great flood 30,000 years ago, after which they began passing on their knowledge to humans. He showed a photograph of a woodcarving from 7,000 B.C. of a large man handing over a plow to a smaller man: Ah, the passing on of agricultural knowledge. Anyway, he said, the Nibiru-ites finally jetted home in their spacecraft, around 550 B.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is in the texts; I'm not making it up,'' Mr. Sitchin said, finishing his coffee. ''They wanted to create primitive workers from the homo erectus and give him the genes to allow him to think and use tools.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He showed photographs of ancient Sumerian carvings and etchings showing what he said were alien gods dressed in space helmets and suits. He pointed to something he called Nibiru in diagrams of the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite a theory -- has he sold it to Hollywood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh no, not yet,'' he said solemnly. ''I'm waiting for Spielberg.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronaut repairmen had hardly finished tightening the last stubborn bolts on the Hubble Space Telescope last summer when astronomers set the controls on the refurbished telescope to the dim and distant past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a new long-distance observing record. Astronomers announced in a series of papers over the fall and in a news conference last week that Hubble had recorded images of the earliest and most distant galaxies ever seen, blurry specks of light that burned brightly only 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The specks are clouds only one-twentieth the size of the Milky Way galaxy and only 1 percent of its mass, and seem to show the lingering effects of the first generation of stars to form in the universe in that they get bluer the farther back you go in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new galaxies, along with other recent discoveries like the violent supernova explosion of a star only 620 million years after the Big Bang, take astronomers deep into a period of cosmic history known as the dark ages, which has been little explored. It was then that stars and galaxies were starting to light up vigorously in larger and larger numbers and that a fog of hydrogen that had enveloped space after the Big Bang fires had cooled mysteriously dissipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are the seeds of the great galaxies of today,'' said Garth Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who discussed the new galaxies last week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington. ''We are pushing Hubble to the limit to find these objects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Ellis of the California Institute of Technology, one of many astronomers who have been working with the observations, said, ''We're reaching the beginning where galaxies formed for the first time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Illingworth and his colleague Richard Bouwens led a team that used Hubble's new Wide Field Camera 3, which was installed by the astronauts in May, to stare at a small patch of the southern sky over 62 orbits in what they call the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The patch, known as the southern GOODS field, for Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, has been observed by a variety of telescopes and satellites, including Hubble in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The release of Dr. Illingworth's observations in the fall led to a kind of gold rush in astronomy. In the last three months, several teams, using different ways to analyze the data, have produced 15 papers and articles about the new galaxies. Dr. Illingworth said in an interview that his team had identified 21 galaxies from 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang, and that other groups had found similar numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most distant, he said, was about 600 million years after the Big Bang. The universe is about 13.7 billion years old, cosmologists agree, meaning that the light from these galaxies has been on its way to us for 13 billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, some of the groups say they have identified possible galaxies as far back as 480 million years after the Big Bang, but they disagree on how many and which ones they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new wide-field camera has an infrared capability, which makes it well suited for probing the early universe. As the universe expands, objects farther away from us go away faster, shifting their light to longer, redder wavelengths. The most distant galaxies appear to be emitting almost all of their light at even longer wavelengths, as invisible infrared, or heat, radiation. Indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope, being built for a 2014 launch to explore the very earliest years of creation, will be an entirely infrared telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The galaxies are too far away and faint to be studied spectroscopically by even the largest telescopes on Earth, but by comparing their brightnesses in different infrared wavelength bands with optical images recorded by Hubble in 2004, astronomers could estimate how reddened the galaxies were. Some that showed up in the infrared images did not even appear in visible light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the graceful spirals and grandly round ellipticals that populate today's universe, these baby galaxies are dumpy and irregular. Another clue that astronomers are getting close to the start of time is the blueness of the new Hubble galaxies when the effects of cosmic expansion are taken into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to theoretical models, the first stars were born about 200 million years after the Big Bang, and consisted solely of hydrogen and helium. Lacking the elements to make dust, which reddens starlight, these stars would be bluer than those today. The colors of these galaxies, Dr. Illingworth said, suggested the presence of stars born only 300 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new galaxies continue a recent trend in which the farther into the past astronomers look, the fewer and fainter and smaller galaxies they find, suggesting that the first billion years of history was a time in which galaxies and stars were rapidly increasing in number. The universe reached a peak in the birth rate of stars about 10 billion years ago, when it was a third of its present age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers still do not know, however, if they will find enough galaxies and stars in that epoch when the universe was only half a billion years old to have burned off the hydrogen fog. That process is technically known as reionization, in which electrons are stripped from the hydrogen nuclei, making intergalactic space transparent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More evidence that galaxies and massive stars were already going strong a few hundred million years after the Big Bang came last spring when NASA's Swift satellite detected gamma rays from an exploding star that was traced to a galaxy only 625 million years from the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nial Tanvir of the University of Leicester and his colleagues called that blast ''a glimpse of the end of the dark ages,'' suggesting that similar gamma ray bursts from that era could be used to measure the rate of star formation back then and figure out if stars were enough to reionize the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ellis said, ''It does look as if galaxies could do the trick of causing reionization.'' It could be that the new Hubble galaxies were just the tip of the iceberg and that many more galaxies are lurking just below the threshold of detection. ''The new camera,'' he said, ''has revealed a bunch of little glowworms. The James Webb telescope will see the sky blazing with them.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is preparing for a major evaluation of its human spaceflight program, even as many who will conduct the survey have yet to be informed of the agency's revised mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansive, multimonth technical study, still in the preliminary stages, might be similar to the Exploration Systems Architecture Study that in 2005 settled on the design of the agency's program to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given a possible shift in goals and budgets -- President Obama will reveal his space plans on Monday in his 2011 budget request -- the study is to survey the variety of available rockets and spacecraft, consider different strategies for reaching future destinations and recommend a framework of how to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're going to be putting meat on the bones'' of options proposed last fall by a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program, said a person involved with the preparations, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the people who will be working on the study had not, at least as of Friday, been told what the destination, budget and timeline would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the Obama administration had decided to start a competition for commercial companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, following a suggestion of the blue-ribbon panel, which was led by Norman R. Augustine, a former <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama will propose increasing NASA's budget, now $18.7 billion, by less than $1 billion, an administration official said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The request may also set off new tussles over rockets -- among companies hoping their designs will win out in the reshuffled space landscape, and between the administration and members of Congress who are not convinced that NASA needs another change in mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many NASA employees, little will change in the short run. Five more flights remain for the space shuttles, scheduled to be retired this year. Work on the Ares I, the rocket that NASA has been developing for the past four years to replace the shuttles, will continue, even as many expect it to be eventually displaced by the commercial rockets and canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has provided few details on what it is considering or has decided other than to insist that it will not abandon human spaceflight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The president is committed to a robust 21st-century space program,'' said a White House spokesman, Nicholas Shapiro, ''and his budget will reflect that dedication to NASA.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the loss of the space shuttle Columbia in 2003, President George W. Bush announced a major space initiative in which NASA, for the first time since 1972, would go beyond low-Earth orbit and return astronauts to the Moon by 2020 and then aim for Mars. But the agency never received as much money as had been envisioned for the program, known as Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration then appointed the Augustine panel, which concluded that the program was not viable at current financing levels. But the panel said that with a budget increase of $3 billion a year, NASA could push its human spaceflight program beyond low-Earth orbit and also extend the life of the International Space Station at least four years, to 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Obama opts for a major shift in the human spaceflight program, a protracted battle with some members of Congress could follow. In passing the budget for 2010, Congress included a clause that none of the money could be spent on canceling or changing Constellation -- or starting an alternative -- without its approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further complicating the politics of space, the NASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel has given a strong endorsement for continuing Ares I, because the agency had not established standards and processes for certifying that a commercial rocket is safe for astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's delay in announcing a space policy gives Constellation defenders optimism that the Ares I will survive, at least in some form. One possibility is that NASA would continue work on it as a backup to the commercial endeavors and speed development of the Ares V, the planned heavy-lift rocket that would use many of the same components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know I'm feeling quite a bit better about things than I was last fall,'' said an industry executive involved with the Constellation program, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because NASA does not want contractors to talk publicly about the future of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some wonder how Ares I and commercial competitors can all fit within NASA's already limited budget. Cost savings that might result from the efficiencies of a commercial operation would not show up for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration might also enlist the help and financing of other nations to handle parts of space exploration -- perhaps giving the European Space Agency the job of building a lunar lander, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who oversaw the creation of Constellation and remains a staunch defender, said that would be a mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't imagine the situation where the United States doesn't want to have end-to-end capability to reach the lunar surface,'' Dr. Griffin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most closely examined budget numbers may well be the proposed spending for the following four years, and how close those figures are to the additional $3 billion a year that the blue-ribbon panel said was required for a ''worthy'' human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My question is, Is it enough to have a viable space program?'' said John M. Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. ''And I can't answer that until I see what happens after the next year.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Martian rover Spirit will rove no more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced Tuesday that the Spirit, mired in a sand pit for the last 10 months, would remain there forever. But the officials said they were hopeful that the Spirit would continue life as a stationary science station -- if it survives the upcoming Martian winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not a day of mourning for Spirit,'' Douglas McCuistion, director of the Mars exploration program at NASA headquarters in Washington, said during a telephone news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Spirit's six wheels broke through a hard crust into sandy material and became stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, as it was attempting to drive out, its right rear wheel failed. The right front wheel had stopped turning four years ago. Officials decided that even if the Spirit could extricate itself, with two bad wheels, its best driving days were past. The Spirit, designed to last three months, has survived for more than six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of a poignant moment for us,'' said Steven W. Squyres, the mission's principal investigator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission managers will focus in the coming weeks on trying to get the rover's solar panels pointed more toward the sun. As the Martian winter approaches, the shorter days will mean less energy, and the rover will most likely exhaust its batteries. The rover is programmed to put itself into a deep sleep, and it was designed to survive the frigid cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She was designed to go through this, but again I'll caution this was for a brand new rover,'' said John Callas, the project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beginning of the Martian winter is in May, and the NASA officials are hoping that the Spirit can resume its science activities in August or September, conducting radio and atmospheric studies that were not possible when it was moving. Precise radio measurements could pin down wobbles in Mars' axis of rotation, and that could tell whether the center of the planet is liquid or solid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama will end NASA's return mission to the moon and turn to private companies to launch astronauts into space when he unveils his budget request to Congress next week, an administration official said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift would ''put NASA on a more sustainable and ambitious path to the future,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the changes have angered some members of Congress, particularly from Texas, the location of the Johnson Space Center, and Florida, the location of the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My biggest fear is that this amounts to a slow death of our nation's human space flight program,'' Representative Bill Posey, Republican of Florida, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's request, which will be announced on Monday, would add $6 billion over five years to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget compared with projections last year. With the increase, NASA would receive $100 billion over the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new money would largely go to commercial companies that would provide transportation to and from the International Space Station. Until now, NASA has designed and operated its own spacecraft, like the space shuttles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial rockets would displace the Ares I, the rocket that NASA has been developing for the past four years to replace the shuttles, which are scheduled to be retired this year. Companies expected to seek the new space taxi business include <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, a partnership between <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> that launches rockets for the United States Air Force, and <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, a start-up company led by Elon Musk, who founded PayPal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at a news conference in Israel on Wednesday, Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, gave hints of the new direction. ''What NASA will focus on is facilitating the success of -- I like to use the term 'entrepreneurial interests,' '' General Bolden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics wonder whether the commercial approach would be significantly faster or cheaper than completing the Ares I and the Orion capsule that would carry the astronauts, and how astronaut safety would be maintained. NASA has spent about $9 billion on Ares I and Orion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have already spent valuable time and billions of dollars developing this program,'' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas, said in an e-mail statement. ''It makes no sense to throw away a plan backed by 50 years of NASA experience and institutional knowledge in favor of start-up operations, which may encounter delays and unknown obstacles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's proposal would further dismantle what remains of the human spaceflight initiative started by the Bush administration in 2004. Last year, $3.5 billion in spending was cut from President George W. Bush's NASA budget projection for 2011 through 2013, money that would have been used to develop the lander that was to return astronauts to the moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed budget increase would also be much less than the $3-billion-a-year increase that a blue-ribbon committee appointed by the Obama administration said was needed for NASA to successfully pursue a human spaceflight program beyond low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As widely expected, Mr. Obama's request will seek to extend the life of the space station five years, to 2020. It also proposes investments to improve the facilities at the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retirement of the space shuttles will cost at least 4,600 of the 15,000 jobs at the Kennedy Space Center. The administration official said the commercial launching initiative could create up to 1,700 jobs in Florida, but that figure is based on projections of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sally K. Ride, a former astronaut who served on the blue-ribbon panel, said she was encouraged by the budget increase for NASA in light of the planned freeze on domestic spending over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They plan to be sending people beyond low-Earth orbit, and they have a good formulation,'' Dr. Ride said. ''I think the way to evaluate this plan when it's rolled out is to ask whether the administration has given NASA the funds for what it's asked to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It appears to me the answer is yes,'' Dr. Ride said, based on briefings she had received on the plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the administration took options the panel presented and ''came up with an innovative approach for NASA.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- In one small step for preservation and one giant leap of logic, the official historical commission of California voted Friday to protect two small urine collection devices, four space-sickness bags and dozens of other pieces of detritus, all currently residing nearly a quarter of a million miles from the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a joke. I repeat, Houston, not a joke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saying it wanted to raise awareness of both the state's cosmic contribution to the Apollo 11 moon mission and the potential threats from lunar interlopers, the California State Historical Resources Commission voted unanimously to designate more than 100 pieces of space trash, scientific apparatus and commemorative tokens to its list of protected resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milford Wayne Donaldson, the state historic preservation officer, said the reasoning behind the first-of-its-kind designation was simple: Scores of California companies worked on the Apollo mission, and much of their handiwork remains of major historical value to the state, regardless of where it is now or what it was for used for then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has a significance that goes way further than whether it came from a quarter million miles away or not,'' Mr. Donaldson said. ''They are all parts of the event.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Apollo 11 was indeed a landmark mission -- during which Neil A. Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon and he and Buzz Aldrin apparently ditched their boots -- it wasn't exactly tidy. Worried about the weight of their landing capsule, the harried lunar explorers left behind tons of trash, including empty food bags, electrical equipment and, yes, several receptacles meant for bodily waste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a collection of artifacts of historical note and emotion: Mr. Armstrong's footprint, for example, and an American flag. Apollo 11 also left behind a mission patch from Apollo 1, in which three astronauts died in a fire, and a message from world leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while some of the garbage might seem like, well, garbage, California is just one of several states seeking protection for the items in the face of possible lunar missions by other nations as well as a budding space tourism industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Mexico, home to early Apollo test sites like the White Sands Missile Range, a similar measure is expected to be considered by the state's cultural properties review committee in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beth O'Leary, an assistant professor of anthropology at New Mexico State University and an expert in ''lunar archeology,'' said she had screamed with delight when she heard the news from California. But she admitted that persuading people to safeguard Apollo's space junk was often a challenge, if only because it is on -- you know -- the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think anyone argues with it being a major event in the history for humanity, right up there with the invention of fire,'' Ms. O'Leary said. ''But people don't tend to think of it as something we need to be protecting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for the last decade, she and other historians and archeologists have been pushing for protection through their Lunar Legacy Project, which has an inventory of items left behind at Tranquility Base where the astronauts landed in July 1969, including a plaque spelling out exactly who made the mess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon,'' it reads. ''We came in peace for all mankind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Donaldson said he hoped his commission's vote might help goad the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization into placing the landing site on the World Heritage List, an international compilation of famed landmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's a threat from private companies,'' Mr. Donaldson said. ''And with today's technology, they could probably pinpoint this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, Mr. Donaldson admitted that there were no ''space cops'' available to safeguard the state's newest historical resource. But, like the Apollo astronauts themselves, he seemed optimistic that Friday's vote might lead to bigger and better things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hopefully,'' he said, ''this will take off.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ambitious space initiative that President Obama unveiled for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday calls for sweeping changes in mission and priorities for the 52-year-old agency, yet it omits two major details: where the agency will send its astronauts and a timetable for getting them there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Obama's proposed budget is implemented, NASA a few years from now would be fundamentally different from NASA today. The space agency would no longer operate its own spacecraft, but essentially buy tickets for its astronauts on commercially launched rockets. It would end its program to return to the moon and would pursue future missions to deep space by drawing more cooperation and financing from other nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some, like Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, where NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has been developing the rockets singled out for cancellation by Mr. Obama's budget, the proposed changes ''begin the death march for the future of U.S. human spaceflight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others like Charles Lurio, a space consultant and an advocate of a so-called New Space commercial approach, were ecstatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What this potentially gives us is a real space program, not a faux space program,'' Mr. Lurio said. ''The real one is one that builds a foundation for practical use and exploration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As expected, Mr. Obama's proposal seeks to cancel the Ares I rocket, in development for four years as a replacement to the space shuttles. More unexpected, the request also would kill Orion, the crew capsule that was to sit atop the Ares I. The Orion is the only spacecraft in development that would be capable of traveling beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Mr. Obama's request would add $6 billion over five years to the NASA budget. The agency is projected to receive $100 billion over the 2011 to 2015 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether Congress agrees to the restructuring of NASA remains to be seen. After spending $9 billion on Constellation, the program to return to the moon, canceling the contracts with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span> and other companies would cost an additional $2.5 billion, NASA officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As reports of the impending cancellation of Constellation leaked out last week, members of Congress, particularly those representing Alabama, Florida and Texas, the homes of the NASA centers most involved with the program, expressed concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, released an angry statement that said, ''If early reports for what the White House wants to do with NASA are correct, then the president's green-eyeshade-wearing advisers are dead wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a telephone news conference on Monday, Mr. Nelson sounded more conciliatory. He called Ares I ''a nonstarter'' because it might not be ready until 2018, and added, ''I hope the Obama bet is correct that the commercial boys will accelerate their development with this NASA money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama budget proposes spending $18 billion over five years for development of technologies like fuel stations in orbit, new types of engines to accelerate spacecraft through space and robotic factories that could churn soil on the moon -- and eventually Mars -- into rocket fuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for a new mission to leave Earth's orbit will probably not be spelled out for a few years, and the budget proposal makes it clear that any future exploration program will be a multinational collaboration, more like the International Space Station than the six moon landings of the Apollo program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all believe that the seventh time we land on the moon will be with our international partners,'' Lori B. Garver, NASA's deputy administrator, said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, instead of using the Ares I to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, $6 billion of the budget would instead go to financing space taxi services from commercial companies -- another controversial change. Skeptics doubt that commercial companies will be able to deliver on their promises as quickly and as inexpensively as they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the approach succeeds, it could jump-start a vibrant space industry, but it is also risky. By canceling the Ares I, NASA would have no backup if the commercial companies were unable to deliver a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One likely competitor for the commercial crew contract is the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, a startup known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and led by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. But its Falcon 9 rocket, the one that would be used to carry astronauts to the space station, has yet to have its first launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another likely competitor, <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, which is a joint venture between <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, has decades of experience building space hardware for NASA. Its rockets, the Delta IV and the Atlas V, have successfully carried military and commercial satellites to space, but the modifications needed for carrying astronauts could be costly and the alliance has also experienced delays and cost overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not said how it would verify that commercial rockets were sufficiently safe for carrying astronauts. Another worry is that the decades of expertise within NASA of operating spacecraft would be lost, and that the commercial companies could stumble as they learn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think this is a dramatic shift in the way we've gone about particularly human spaceflight over the past almost 50 years,'' said John M. Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, who was one of about a dozen people briefed about the NASA proposal on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a somewhat risky proposition,'' Dr. Logsdon said, ''but we've been kind of stuck using the technologies we've developed in the '50s and '60s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norman R. Augustine, the former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> who was the chairman of a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed the human spaceflight program last summer, said the budget proposal reins NASA back into low Earth orbit for at least the next few years. But in contrast to the Constellation program, he said, the budget gives NASA adequate financing to accomplish the tasks it has been assigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a space buff myself, I wish there was more money,'' he said. ''I also realize these are tough times.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Russian space agency has no plans to fly to the Moon and will not be shifting this position now that President Obama has asked NASA to abandon a second American Moon program, the head of the agency suggested in comments to Interfax. The exploration goals of the two space agencies would ''fully coincide'' if America drops its Moon program, the director, Anatoly N. Perminov said. ''Our near-term program has not included any plan for settlement on the moon,'' he said. ''We shouldn't rush from side to side.'' No longer rivals, the two space programs are closely entwined through work on the International Space Station and will become more so when Russian rockets will become, at least for some time, the only means of putting American astronauts into orbit if the space shuttle fleet is retired as expected this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS -- In what seemed intended as a display of technological advance, Iran said on Wednesday that it had fired a rocket into space carrying living organisms -- a rat, two turtles and worms, according to the state-run Press TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The test involved a rocket described as the Kavoshgar-3, which is capable of carrying satellites. Iran's missile program has prompted worries among Western analysts that it is working on a weapons delivery system with broad regional consequences. In December, Iran said it test-fired an improved version of its most advanced missile, the Sejil-2, capable of reaching Israel and parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wednesday launching came a day after the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, suggested that his country would support an agreement to export low-enriched nuclear fuel, a deal put forth by the United States and other Western countries that seeks to head off a crisis over Iran's nuclear program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ahmadinejad's comments, which were reported by Press TV, appeared to contradict Iran's rejection of the deal a few weeks ago, extending a series of ever-shifting public statements by Iran on the proposal. Diplomatic officials greeted Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks with skepticism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, officials in Washington said the Obama administration was accelerating the deployment of new defenses against possible Iranian missile attacks in the Persian Gulf, placing special ships off the Iranian coast and antimissile systems in at least four Arab countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Press TV said Wednesday that the Kavoshgar, or Explorer, was the third of its type to be launched since February 2008 and was carrying an experimental capsule to transfer telemetric data, live pictures and other information to Earth. The model launched Wednesday was described as an updated version of the earlier rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State television broadcast what it said were images of the Kavoshgar-3 hurtling from a desert launching pad, leaving a thick vapor trail. Before the launching, officials were shown putting what looked like living organisms inside a capsule placed in the rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Iranian Aerospace Organization said live video transmission from the latest launching would ''enable further studies on the biological capsule'' that was carrying the rat, turtles and worms, Press TV reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Wednesday, Iran unveiled another satellite carrier, Simorgh-3, and three new domestically built satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of unsuccessful diplomatic overtures, the Obama administration is seeking broad international support for sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, which Western nations say controls a covert nuclear arms program. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama, in his State of the Union address, warned of ''consequences'' if Iran continued to defy United Nations demands to stop manufacturing nuclear fuel. Last Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton publicly warned China that its opposition to sanctions against Iran was shortsighted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Thursday about a House subcommittee hearing on President Obama's budget proposal for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration used an outdated name for an auditing arm of Congress. It is the Government Accountability Office, not the General Accounting Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Feb 06 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Congressional reaction to President Obama's budget for NASA was divided more along geographical than political lines Wednesday, as members of a House subcommittee debated the merits of scrapping the agency's plans to return to the moon by 2020 and shift, instead, to developing new launching technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Pete Olson, a Republican member of the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics whose Texas district includes NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, was sharply critical of Mr. Obama's plan, which would also outsource the launching of astronauts to private enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Olson was joined by Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, a Florida Democrat whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center, where much of the work on the moon mission would have been performed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am extremely concerned about the lack of direction,'' Ms. Kosmas said. ''I don't see a vision. I don't see an inspiration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Republican colleague of Mr. Olson, Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, was much more enthusiastic about the commercial possibilities of spaceflight. Mr. Rohrbacher's district borders Hawthorne, Calif., home of the Space Explorations Technologies Corporation, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for short, which is one of the companies likely to bid on the new contracts to take astronauts into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, the chairwoman of the subcommittee, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, strongly criticized a blue-ribbon panel that defended NASA's human spaceflight program. On Wednesday, she took a more reserved tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My concern today is not numbers on a ledger,'' Ms. Giffords said, ''but rather the fate of the American dream to reach for the stars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's hearing did not include policy officials from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the Obama administration, but instead gathered three of the organizations that watch over NASA: the agency's inspector general, Congress's General Accounting Office and the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph W. Dyer, a retired Navy vice admiral who heads the safety panel, discussed a report issued last month in which the panel advocated the continued development of the rocket that Mr. Obama would like to cancel. The panel said the alternatives would take longer and might cost more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the report was released, Elon Musk, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, said that he had ''lost respect'' for the panel and that his rocket, the Falcon 9, had been designed to meet all of NASA's human rating requirements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Wednesday's hearing, Admiral Dyer countered that the panel had high respect for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. ''But, in terms of fundamentals, the human rating requirements have not been published by NASA,'' he said. ''And therefore a claim that one meets them is, we think, incorrect. It's that simple.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is working on safety standards to guide the work of companies wishing to bid on the astronaut-launching business, Admiral Dyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have insisted that they will not compromise on safety. At a news conference at the National Press Club on Tuesday, Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, introduced five winners of a competition to develop and demonstrate technologies that could be used in a commercial spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I give you my word these vehicles will be safe,'' General Bolden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies receiving the contracts, financed by last year's federal stimulus law, ranged from the huge -- <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, which will get $18 million to develop a capsule that can ride on a variety of rockets -- to smaller ones like Paragon Space Development, of Tucson, which will receive $1.4 million to develop a simple system for purifying air in spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials continue to argue that the change of plans would speed the progress of launching astronauts into space by reducing the costs and investing in new technologies. ''We are not abandoning human spaceflight by any stretch of the imagination,'' General Bolden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said ''tiger teams'' were at work in NASA to put together a more detailed blueprint of where, and when, to send astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, NASA said Robert D. Braun of the Langley Research Center, would become its chief technologist, a position that has not been filled in years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space shuttleEndeavour, carrying the last major piece of the International Space Station, is poised for launching before sunrise on Sunday, the last planned nighttime liftoff of a shuttle ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching is the first of the year as the shuttle program enters its home stretch of five missions this year. The four flights after this one will be largely devoted to carrying science experiments and spare parts to the space station. The shuttles are scheduled to be retired in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every launch is a little bittersweet,'' Michael Moses, the shuttle launch integration manager, said at a news conference Friday. ''We're one closer to the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching is scheduled for 4:39 a.m. at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'll see it all the way up the East Coast,'' said Michael Leinbach, the shuttle launch director. Weather forecasts call for an 80 percent chance of favorable weather with only some concerns of high winds at the launching pad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main cargo for the Endeavour on its 13-day mission is Node 3, a 23-foot-long, 15-foot-wide module for the space station, built under contract with the European Space Agency. It will house many of the station's life-support systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the station piece that would have been called Colbert had NASA abided by the results of a poll last year that asked the public for naming suggestions. Stephen Colbert, the host of the parody talk show ''The Colbert Report,'' urged his fans to vote for naming the station segment after him, and they did in large numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NASA, which had said the poll results were not binding, instead bestowed the module with the name Tranquility, after Apollo 11's landing site on the moon in 1969. The space agency did name after Mr. Colbert a piece of exercise equipment, which went to the space station last August and will be moved into the Tranquility module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the shuttle launches on Sunday morning, most of the shuttle staff members will be able to watch the Super Bowl in the evening. If the launching is delayed by weather or a mechanical problem, they will instead probably be busy preparing for another launching attempt on Monday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not going to change our plan based on the Super Bowl, frankly,'' Mr. Leinbach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttle officials also acknowledged the potential turmoil in NASA's future after President Obama proposed last week to cancel Constellation, NASA's program that was to return astronauts to the Moon. But they said that would not compromise their attention during the shuttle mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The team is ready to go,'' Mr. Leinbach said. ''We will not be distracted on the console. We will not be distracted working on the orbiters. I have no doubt about it. It's a very, very professional team.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The launching of the space shuttleEndeavour was postponed a day because of thick clouds that moved in during the last few hours of the countdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forecasters had predicted an 80 percent chance of favorable weather for the early morning launching, but a weather system from the north pushed farther south than expected.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The space shuttleEndeavour thundered into orbit before dawn Monday morning, briefly turning darkness into daylight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second effort to get the Endeavour off the ground, 24 hours after clouds over the launching pad scrubbed Sunday's attempt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clouds again encroached, but there were enough holes to allow the Endeavour to lift off on schedule at 4:14 a.m., a bright streak rising to the northeast along the East Coast. It was the 130th launching of a shuttle and probably the final night launching as the program winds down and ends after four more flights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What a beautiful launch we had this morning,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said in a news conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour is carrying the last major piece of the International Space Station. Two of the shuttle's crew members, Nicholas J. M. Patrick and Lt. Col. Robert L. Behnken of the Air Force, will conduct three spacewalks to install a 23-foot-long, 15-foot-wide Tranquility module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The module includes a seven-windowed dome, or cupola, that will offer panoramic views of Earth and space. The viewing area, large enough for two astronauts, will be used to control the station's 60-foot-long robotic arm and to observe other activities outside the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour is also delivering spare parts for the station's water system, which recycles urine and sweat into clean water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A camera on the shuttle's external tank detected a strip of insulating foam falling off about two minutes into the flight. Mr. Gerstenmaier estimated it at a quarter-inch thick and a foot long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It didn't appear to impact the orbiter,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said, ''and we see no damage to the orbiter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with all shuttle missions since the loss of the Columbia in 2003, engineers will spend several days examining the foam loss to ensure there was no damage to the Endeavour's heat shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commander of the 13-day mission is Col. George D. Zamka of the Marines, and the pilot is Col. Terry W. Virts Jr. of the Air Force. The other crew members are Stephen K. Robinson and Capt. Kathryn P. Hire of the Navy Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Endeavour mission was off to a smooth start, Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, admitted he had not done a good job of laying out a clear picture of the agency's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a news conference on Saturday, General Bolden accepted blame for the rocky reception that greeted President Obama's plans to revamp NASA's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans, revealed in Mr. Obama's budget request for 2011, call for the cancellation of Constellation, the program that was to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new budget proposal, money that went to the Constellation would instead be used to develop new space technologies like those that would fuel spacecraft in orbit. The task of developing rockets for carrying astronauts to the International Space Station would be turned over to commercial companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said some of the work in the Constellation program might yet be preserved. ''I don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water, if you will,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden also offered some conciliatory words as he acknowledged that the proposal for NASA would probably change as it wound through the budget process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do have to negotiate with my partners in Congress,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general said NASA would still work on a heavy-lift rocket even as the budget proposal sought to cancel the Ares V, the behemoth rocket that would have carried the cargo for a lunar mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said, however, that he did not expect the heavy-lift rocket to be ready until after 2020.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since Apollo astronauts flew to the Moon four decades ago, expert task forces and political leaders have, from time to time, pondered what to do next in human spaceflight. They came up with new directions and new visions, set new goals. Some of their hopes rested on machines that never made it to a launching pad. Others got off the ground but never really soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Obama administration has joined the quest to keep humans flying in space. But will its measured proposals, announced last week, succeed where others fell so far short?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be too soon to say, but history colors the prospects gray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While astronauts were still taking giant leaps to lunar plains, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration assumed that Apollo was just the grand-opening to an era of wide-ranging space exploration by people. Success had bred confidence and mobilized skills and the infrastructure for greater achievements. The agency's wish list included a permanent base on the Moon, a 12-person space station orbiting Earth and serviced by reusable shuttles flying back and forth, and eventually human expeditions to Mars, possibly by the late 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only the space shuttle won the Nixon administration's approval, in 1972. The shuttles are still flying, but they are confined to low orbit, and the promised economies and reliability are unfulfilled. They are the aging technology of the early space age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1986, the space program was jolted, but not significantly redirected, by the Challenger disaster. That year, the Reagan administration endorsed the space station. It was given a name, Freedom, but no one seemed to agree on its utility or even its design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With weak Congressional support, the project was going nowhere until the Clinton administration reconceived it as an international endeavor including post-cold-war Russia. The station now had a purpose, though more political than technological or scientific. Shuttles and Russian spacecraft regularly ferry supplies and crews for long-duration visits. But humans remain stalled in low orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, two administrations tried to strike a bolder note vaguely reminiscent of President John F. Kennedy's challenge in 1961 to land men on the Moon ''before this decade is out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, President George Bush set new goals to rouse the space program out of its enforced lethargy. A fleet of heavy-lift rockets would be developed for both robotic and human missions beyond low orbit. Astronauts would return to the Moon to establish permanent outposts and then fly to Mars, perhaps by 2019. The response, almost immediately, was inaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President George W. Bush made a similar appeal. After the shuttle Columbia's disaster in 2003, he introduced a ''new vision'' to revive the floundering space program. It included post-shuttle propulsion systems and crew-carrying vehicles. The goal was a return of astronauts to the Moon by 2020. Sometime after, to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the costs of fighting wars while cutting taxes left little money to support the undertaking. Although several billion dollars have already been invested in advanced hardware, the goals seem illusory, and public support seems thin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, experience brought reminders, so often overlooked, that Apollo was not a realistic model for future endeavors in space exploration. Going to the Moon had been, above all, a campaign in the cold war. The Soviet Union was the feared adversary, even more so after the Sputnik surprise and after Yuri Gagarin's flight made him the first man in space, in spring 1961.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early on, the political scientist John M. Logsdon at George Washington University made a study of the decision-making process leading to Apollo. Dr. Logsdon concluded that Apollo was ''a product of a specific time in history'' and a singular crash program responding to a perceived threat to the country. It did not represent a firm commitment by society to open-ended space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norman R. Augustine, an aerospace industry executive, acknowledged as much when he led a task force that contributed to the first President Bush's proposals. ''The heavy driver for the space program used to be competition with the Soviets,'' Mr. Augustine said at the time. ''Today, there is not that clear competition but the fundamental values of exploration that drive us. They are less tangible, but no less important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one thing is clear and encouraging in President Obama's proposals, it is the recognition of Apollo's exceptionality. Mr. Augustine also served on the committee that advised Mr. Obama, and his point about the changing political matrix has apparently sunk in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been trying to relive Apollo for 40 years, unsuccessfully,'' NASA's deputy administrator, Lori B. Garver, said in an interview with editors and reporters of The New York Times. ''For too long NASA overpromised and underdelivered, and now we will be doing things differently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That remains to be seen. Congressional committees have not begun to examine the proposals and the modest budget increases for NASA. The administration's plan may be ''bold and game-changing,'' in Ms. Garver's words, but several aspects are likely to stir controversy or at least call for closer study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast to the past, the new plan sets no definite timetables, cost estimates or destinations. Nor is there extravagant rhetoric about knowledge and adventure. The Kennedy eloquence about sailing ''this new ocean'' was effective primarily because the nation felt the need to demonstrate its technological superiority in war and peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not having specified goals and targets runs the risk of having a program wander off course. As a first step, the administration proposed scuttling the present plan to return to the Moon by 2020. Development of the rocket and crew capsule for those flights would be stopped, though some of the research might be used in succeeding vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials say that, depending on financing and progress developing new technologies, projections for the timing of the next astronaut ventures might be made in five or six years. The first objective along this ''flexible path'' is just to regain the ability to fly beyond low orbit, forsaken years ago with the decommissioning of the Saturn 5 Moon rocket. Eventually, when the means are available and the national spirit willing, the Moon, asteroids and Mars will be the likeliest destinations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some elements of the new plan may be popular. A pledge to enlist other nations as partners should spread costs. Such a practice with the International Space Station has been encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal to outsource development and ownership of the new flight hardware to private enterprise should win support among conservatives. It also raises questions. Will NASA be able to maintain control over the quality and safety of the new vehicles that, in effect, it will rent for astronaut missions? Will the government be transferring to private hands undue influence over the pursuit of national goals in space?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space program has had some great successes since the Moon landings. Never to be forgotten are the robotic explorations of the Sun's family of planets and the cosmic vistas snapped by far-seeing instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if robotic surrogates can go farther and make discoveries at less cost, the Obama space plan, if nothing else, reminds us that banked fires still burn and may yet light the way to distant shores. Humans will probably not rest until they again ride their technologies themselves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years after astronauts first moved into the International Space Station, they finally installed a picture window last week to take in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Italian-built ''cupola,'' delivered by the shuttle Endeavour, has seven large windows centered on a 30-inch central pane. NASA calls the cupola ''the largest window ever built for space.'' Until now, space travelers have had to be content with the view from portholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA refers to the cupola as a control tower, and it does resemble an early 1930s airport control tower. Its primary role is functional. It will provide astronauts with a view of the space station's exterior robotic arm and of visiting spacecraft docking with the space station. But the $27 million cupola also provides a panoramic view of Earth and the surrounding cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Wednesday, the protective shutters covering the windows were opened for the first time. Africa's Sahara Desert filled the view. ''The astronauts who are accustomed to views that you and I cannot really describe were moved to tears when they looked out the windows of the cupola for the first time,'' Bob Dempsey, the NASA flight director for the mission, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Windows have always been important to astronauts. In ''The Right Stuff,'' Tom Wolfe told of how the first American astronauts had to beg for a window in their tiny capsules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engineers hate windows. They are vulnerable to micrometeorite strikes. They admit sunlight that increases the heat load when, in the space station's case, it orbits through the day half of the earth. The seals can deteriorate after years of enduring the drastic temperature changes in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address some of those dangers, the cupola's windows come with shutters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Robinson, a space station scientist, said in a NASA news release that ''crews tell us that Earth-gazing is important to them. The astronauts work hard up there and are away from their families for a long time. Observing the Earth and the stars helps relax and inspire them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new window is reminiscent of dramatic round windows in classical buildings, like the duomo in Florence or Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. It also resembles the cupola-like cockpit of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo's spaceship in ''Star Wars,'' and Captain Nemo's giant porthole in the study of the submarine Nautilus in ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.'' The cupola attaches to a new section of the station with waste-processing equipment, exercise gear and some living quarters, including more comfortable sleep stations. It used to be known as Node 3. Now it is named Tranquility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is late in the game for the window to arrive. The station is almost complete. Only four more shuttle flights are scheduled. The station was originally supposed to be vacated after 2015, although President Obama has proposed extending its life to 2020. Adding the cupola now has a bit of the feel of a suburban home owner trying to spruce up his dull tract house by installing a bay window in the family room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the view is to kill for.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UPHAM, N.M. -- Take Highway 51 east out of Truth or Consequences, a small city that years ago assumed the name of a game show on a dare. Drive through miles and miles of desert, then turn right at an old train depot whose bustle has long since pulled out. Keep going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After eight miles, turn left on a dirt road that leads deeper into the sage and yucca vastness of New Mexico, past a ranch that used to be a stage stop on an ancient trade route called El Camino Real. Soon after, you will come to your destination: the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, where rattlesnakes hibernate and rabbits scurry, there unfolds a two-mile runway designed to accommodate spaceships. And right beside it, past those giant rumbling tractors of sci-fi design, the groundwork is being laid for a hangar large enough to store spaceships between launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a secret government project, or some NASA reception hall for alien dignitaries. This is Spaceport America, a $198 million endeavor by the State of New Mexico to plumb the commercial potential of the suborbital heavens -- a place once known only to astronauts, dreamers and the occasional chimp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Space tourism. Scientific research. Satellite deliveries. All possible up there, where the stars glitter like spilled coins. Who knows? One day you might decide to skip another two-week vacation in the Wisconsin Dells for a two-hour trip into space. Fly Virgin Galactic. See the sights from as high as 80 miles up. Five minutes of weightlessness guaranteed. Just $200,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's call last month for fundamental changes in the mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration seemed to open the door, or roof, ever wider to private industry. Some people here interpreted his words to mean that your seat back and tray table should be in their full upright positions, because commercial space travel is about to blast off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this flat, deserted, mostly rain-free stretch of New Mexico is the perfect location, says Will Whitehorn, the president of Virgin Galactic, the spaceport's anchor tenant. ''It is about the closest you get on planet Earth to a Martian landscape,'' he says .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern New Mexico has long held claim to the skies, thanks in part to pioneers with local ties, like Robert Goddard, a father of modern rocketry; J. P. Stapp, a leader in aerospace safety; and Ham, the space chimp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might also include Gary Whitehead, 43, affable car salesman from Truth or Consequences, though not because his family's dealership was once owned by the former astronaut Frank Borman. Mr. Whitehead, a longtime public servant, has been championing a spaceport in New Mexico since 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then he was a freshly elected member of the Sierra County Commission, captivated by an entity that had been created by various visionaries and politicians. Its understated name: the Southwest Regional Space Task Force. Its over-the-top goal: to have a spaceport built in southwestern New Mexico one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitehead wanted in, so he created a space task force for Sierra County. Word soon spread that if you wanted a deal on a car, or information about the economic possibilities of the great beyond, Gary Whitehead was the man to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people in Truth or Consequences dismissed the spaceport plan as ''crazy Buck Rogers stuff,'' Mr. Whitehead recalls. Then again, this is the sleepy spa city that, in 1950, changed its name from Hot Springs because Ralph Edwards, the host of ''Truth or Consequences,'' promised to broadcast from the first town to adopt his radio show's name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Over the years the city has voted to keep the name, perhaps as a way of giving thanks that the offer had not come from, say, ''Bowling for Dollars.'' It has also named a park after Mr. Edwards, who for a half-century returned every year to celebrate the city that called his bluff.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept of a spaceport remained just that for many years, even though it seemed to make perfect sense. An 18,000-acre stretch of the Cain family ranch was an ideal location for a spaceport. The restricted airspace of the White Sands Missile Range meant uncluttered skies for launchings. And with the high elevation, you could argue that a space launching's first mile was free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, about five years ago, things began to click. Since then, New Mexico has added the spaceport to its economic development plan; Virgin Galactic, the commercial space travel business of the British billionaire Richard Branson, has signed a 20-year lease; construction has begun; and 326 people have placed reservations for their trip to suborbital space. Virgin Galactic says it has received $44 million in deposits so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, most residents here seem open to the idea. Two of three local counties have voted to support a sales tax to help pay for the space project, including Sierra County, where Mr. Whitehead was a co-chairman of a lobbying campaign called People for Aerospace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, Spaceport America has been part of the local conversation for so long that it stirs about as much excitement as a new Applebee's. Last year, for example, The Las Cruces Sun-News published a headline that read: ''Spaceport, Animal Shelter Board Members Chosen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitehead, though, has gone from ho-hum to wow. At first he saw the project merely as a way to lift the local economy, he says. But as the project took shape, he felt awe. ''It became, 'Gee whiz,' '' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whitehead, who was recently appointed to the state's Spaceport Authority, which is overseeing the project, checks in at the village of construction trailers that have cropped up amid the desert brush. Accompanied by Dave Wilson, a marketing consultant, he leads a quick hardhat tour, past signs that say ''Caution: Equipment Crossing'' and ''Authorized Launch Personnel Only.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right here, where the ground is being cleared, or ''grubbed,'' will be the 110,000-square-foot Terminal Hangar Facility, which will also include administrative offices. And here, close to the unfolding ribbon of runway, is where a groundbreaking ceremony in June featured actors dressed as Old World explorers and dignitaries discussing the New World discovery of the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And here, not far from the home of a ranch hand, is the Vertical Launch Facility, where several space vessels have been shot into the sky. One, in 2007, contained some of the cremated remains of dozens of people, including the astronaut Gordon Cooper and James Doohan, who played Scotty in ''Star Trek.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the hope is to send people, not ashes, into space. This could -- could -- happen as early as 2011, although Virgin Galactic says that it is concentrating first on matters of licensing and, especially, safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still. Imagine. A mothership named Eve zooms off the runway and 50,000 feet into the sky, where it releases a smaller spaceship, the Enterprise, that rockets higher still. High enough for the two pilots and six paying customers to see the curvature of the Earth, and hear the silence of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagining this is not difficult for Mr. Whitehead. His problem, he says, is convincing people that ''there's more to this than rich people flying to space.'' These customers, he says, will effectively be underwriting the possibility for space research, space education and all sorts of ''space-related businesses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tour ends, and is followed by a long trip back to Truth or Consequences, where the lot at Whitehead Chevrolet is filled with earthbound vessels, new and used. But the artwork on display inside -- Van Gogh's mysterious night skies -- reflects the starry, starry dreams of a car dealer in a place known to accept dares.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The shuttle Endeavour arrived home late Sunday, dropping out of a partly cloudy night sky to a smooth touchdown, leaving the International Space Station behind in orbit with a new life support module and a bay window observation deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Descending at a 21-degree angle after a 5,000-mile glide from space, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marines pulled up the shuttle's nose and Col. Terry W. Virts Jr. of the Air Force, the pilot, deployed the ship's landing gear. The Endeavour touched down on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center at 10:20 p.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few minutes later, the craft rolled to a stop on the runway's centerline, ending a two-week mission spanning 217 orbits since blastoff on Feb. 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston, Endeavour, wheels stopped,'' Colonel Zamka radioed to mission control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Roger, wheels stopped, Endeavour. Welcome home. Congratulations to you and the crew on an outstanding mission, installing the Tranquility node and opening up the cupola's windows to the world,'' Rick Sturckow, an astronaut, replied from Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Endeavour crew -- Colonel Zamka; Colonel Virts; the flight engineer, Stephen K. Robinson; Kathryn P. Hire, a captain in the Navy Reserve; and the two spacewalkers, Nicholas J. M. Patrick and Lt. Col. Robert L. Behnken of the Air Force -- planned to fly back to Texas on Monday after reunions with friends and family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Endeavour back on the ground, engineers planned to haul the shuttle Discovery from its hangar to the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building on Tuesday for attachment to an external tank and a pair of solid-fuel rocket boosters. Rollout to pad 39A is planned for March 2, setting the stage for a launching on April 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only four more missions are planned before the shuttles are retired this fall, a milestone that will signal the end of manned space flights from American soil until commercial vendors can develop replacement rocket systems later in the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, American astronauts will hitch rides to and from the space station aboard Russian Soyuz capsules at more than $50 million a seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final shuttle missions will be devoted to ferrying supplies, spare parts and science equipment to the station in an attempt to leave the outpost as well stocked as possible before the heavy-lift shuttle stops flying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary goals of the Endeavour's mission were to deliver and install a new life support module called Tranquility, along with a seven-window cupola intended for use by robot arm operators that is already providing spectacular panoramic views for Earth observation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tranquility and the cupola, both provided by the European Space Agency in return for shuttle launching services and crew time aboard the space station, were installed during the first of three spacewalks by Colonel Behnken and Mr. Patrick. The cupola was then moved from its launching position on Tranquility's outboard end to an Earth-facing port.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the attachment of Tranquility and the cupola, the space station is more than 98 percent complete, with a pressurized volume of 28,947 cubic feet -- nearly the same size as the interior of a 747 jumbo jet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many ways can a star go ''kaboom!''? It might depend on what kind of galaxy the star lives in, astronomers said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the last 20 years, astronomers seeking to measure the cosmos have used a special type of exploding star, known as Type 1a supernovas, as distance markers. They are thought to result when stars known as white dwarfs grow beyond a certain weight limit, setting off a thermonuclear cataclysm that is not only bright enough to be seen across the universe but is also remarkably uniform from one supernova to the next. Using them, two teams of astronomers a little more than a decade ago reached the startling and now widely held conclusion that some ''dark energy'' was speeding up the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But astronomers, to their embarrassment, have not been able to agree on how the white dwarf gains its fatal weight and explodes, whether by slowly grabbing material from a neighboring star or by crashing into another white dwarf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone news conference on Wednesday and a paper published Thursday in the journal Nature, Marat Gilfanov and his colleague, Akos Bogdan, both of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, said that for at least one class of galaxies in the universe, the roundish conglomerations of older, redder stars known as ellipticals, these supernovas are mostly produced by collisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have revealed the source of the most important explosions in cosmology,'' Dr. Gilfanov said, adding that until now ''we didn't know exactly what they were.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasoning that white dwarfs slowly gobbling gas from neighbors would emit X-rays as the captured gas fell and was heated, Dr. Gilfanov and Dr. Bogdan used NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory to look at five elliptical galaxies and the central bulge of the nearby Andromeda galaxy -- all of which are composed of older stars. The satellite recorded only about one-thirtieth to one-fiftieth of the X-rays that would be expected from such white dwarfs, leading the astronomers to conclude that no more than 5 percent of the supernovas in those types of stellar systems could be produced by accreting white dwarfs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observations leave open the possibility that accreting dwarfs might be responsible for more of the supernovas in spiral galaxies like our own, which tend to have younger, more massive stars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That leaves open the possibility of two different kinds of Type 1a supernovas at loose in the universe and could add extra uncertainty into efforts to use exploding stars as standard candles to make precise measurements of the universe. Accreting white dwarfs go off at a precisely determined mass known as the Chandrasekhar limit, but a pair of colliding dwarfs could have a range of masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mario Livio, a theorist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said that while the new results and the idea of two classes of supernovas ''muddies the water,'' they would not affect the measurements of dark energy. Most of the supernovas in those studies, he said, came from spiral galaxies, and the astronomers, moreover, were very careful to calibrate their data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main results so far will remain unchanged,'' Dr. Livio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Riess, of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute and a first-rate dark energy hunter, called the new paper ''an interesting study.'' He compared the two theories of supernovas to lighting a stick of dynamite with a fuse versus banging them together to see if they would go off. ''If we find a connection to where nature does it one way versus the other, we could use that information to improve the use of these candles,'' Dr. Riess wrote in an e-mail message. ''I think we are getting close to that point now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 26 about Congressional scrutiny of President Obama's space program misidentified the Senate panel where the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., testified on Feb. 24. It was the Science and Space Subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation -- not the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Mar 17 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, faced skeptical, sometimes hostile questioning on Thursday from members of a key House committee who said they opposed the Obama administration's plans to revamp the nation's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden told the Committee on Science and Technology that the president's $19 billion budget proposal for NASA -- which would cancel the agency's program to send astronauts back to the Moon, invest in new space technologies and turn to commercial companies for transportation beyond low-Earth orbit -- would provide a ''more affordable and more sustainable'' approach to space exploration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the committee's chairman, Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee, said the proposal represented ''a radical change'' and ''has raised as many questions as it has answered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the second time in two days that General Bolden had sought to defend the administration's plans. On Wednesday, he appeared before the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Space. In addition, John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser, faced a number of barbed comments and questions at two other hearings Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, those speaking out against the changes are not just members of Congress representing Alabama, Florida and Texas -- the homes of the NASA centers that would be most directly affected by the cancellation of the rockets and spacecraft that make up the current program, known as Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was against privatization in the Bush administration,'' Representative David Wu, Democrat of Oregon, said at Thursday's session. ''I am against privatization in the Obama administration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wu told General Bolden that he doubted there was much profit for commercial companies beyond the NASA business. ''I would encourage the administration and your agency to consider whether this is premature, whether this is wise and whether this dooms us to a future where there are no Americans in space, or at least the dominant language in space is not English,'' Mr. Wu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has spent $9 billion and five years working on Constellation, and the budget proposal allocates an additional $2.5 billion for canceling the current contracts. General Bolden acknowledged to the House committee that the space agency was still compiling the actual costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Lincoln Davis, Democrat of Tennessee, said he had also yet to be convinced of the administration's arguments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until we have more discussions, I will be one advocate for continuing the program that we have,'' Mr. Davis said. ''You must convince me that the vision that I'm not seeing, that you have, that you're proposing, is better than Constellation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon praised aspects of the budget, like increased financing for science and next-generation technologies, but expressed reservations about turning over the launching of astronauts to the private sector. He said he was concerned that the federal government would end up bailing out the private companies because they were ''too important to fail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden responded that NASA had not conducted market surveys on the viability of commercial space companies. ''I am depending upon surveys and on information that has come from the industry itself,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gordon said that was not an acceptable answer. ''This is a little bit like the fox looking after the henhouse,'' he said. ''Certainly NASA needs to look into this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the members in attendance also criticized the lack of details in the budget proposal. General Bolden apologized repeatedly for not briefing members of Congress before the budget was announced Feb. 1, and for delays in providing more information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much as the members of Congress disliked the proposed changes, it is also unlikely that Congress will decide to provide the money to continue the current Constellation program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Holdren, in testimony to the House science committee a day earlier, pointed to a blue-ribbon panel last year that concluded that the Constellation program needed $45 billion to $60 billion from 2010 to 2020 to succeed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Holdren said the revamped human spaceflight program could achieve its goals ''sooner, faster, safer and cheaper than what could realistically have been achieved under the old approach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on space, suggested the idea of using test flights of the Ares I -- never referring to it by name, but instead calling it Rocket X -- as a backup to the commercial efforts and to maintain portions of the current NASA work force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, that would essentially continue the work of Constellation under another name and continue NASA's conundrum of how to achieve all of its mandates with limited money.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- The Heavenly Palace, the first module in China's permanent space station, will be launched next year, a senior aerospace official confirmed Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official, Qi Faren, said the craft, an orbiting laboratory known in Mandarin as Tiangong-1, would initially serve as a docking station for other spacecraft. His remarks were carried by Xinhua, the official news agency. A model of the module was unveiled during New Year celebrations last year. The 8.5-ton laboratory is expected to be 30 feet long, with a crew of three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The China National Space Administration said it planned three docking missions with the lab next year. The space agency's long-range plans include a permanent space station that will incorporate the Tiangong-1, and a lunar mission by 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's space program has made major inroads since it launched its first satellite in April 1970, a craft called Dong Fang Hong-1, or The East Is Red. In October 2003, China's first manned spacecraft made 14 orbits of the Earth. The country's first spacewalk took place 18 months ago. Aerospace experts and military officials say the Chinese military space program has made significant advancements in recent years, notably when it tested an antisatellite system in 2007, using a ballistic missile to shoot down one of its own weather satellites 540 miles up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles P. Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalSecurity.org, said in an authoritative study that China's ''space station programs have clearly won out in government planning priorities over the lunar aspirations.'' China has long insisted that its intentions in space are peaceful, although the head of the Chinese Air Force, Gen. Xu Qiliang, appeared to have gone off-message when he said in November that international ''military competition has shifted towards space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Such a shift is a major trend now, and such expansion is a historical inevitability,'' he said, in remarks quoted by state-run news media. ''To some extent, if you control space you can also control the land and the sea, and you will be in an advantageous position.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, introduced a bill in Congress on Wednesday to extend operations of NASA's space shuttles until replacement rockets become available. The bill would also direct NASA to continue developing a new generation of rockets and spacecraft, which could include the Constellation program that President Obama has proposed canceling. The shuttles are scheduled to be retired this fall. They were to be replaced by rockets and a crew capsule being developed under the Constellation program, which was to return astronauts to the Moon. The Obama administration, instead, has proposed turning to commercial companies for transport to Earth orbit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to reports that he was looking for a Plan B to address Congressional concerns, the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Thursday that he was not backing away from the Obama administration's proposal to reshape the nation's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Michael L. Coats, director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, had the blessing of Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, to explore ''what a potential compromise might look like'' with Congress over the direction of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden ''agreed to let us set up a Plan B team,'' Mr. Coats wrote in an e-mail message sent Tuesday to Stephen J. Altemus, the chief engineer at Johnson. Mr. Coats added in a parenthetical remark that Plan B was his phrase, not General Bolden's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement NASA released Thursday, General Bolden said, ''I did not ask anyone for an alternative to the president's plan and budget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's budget request to Congress last month would cancel NASA's Constellation program to send astronauts back to the Moon and would turn to commercial companies for transportation to the International Space Station. The $19 billion request for 2011, an increase of $300 million over the current fiscal year's budget, would also add billions of dollars for research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president's proposal has received a skeptical and sometimes hostile reception in Congress, with some members criticizing it as lacking details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The president's budget for NASA is my budget,'' General Bolden said. ''I strongly support the priorities and the direction for NASA that he has put forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Jacobs, a NASA spokesman, said that General Bolden had talked this week with Mr. Coats and Robert D. Cabana, director of the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida, at a meeting of senior NASA managers and that General Bolden had asked for ideas to speed research and development for a heavy-lift rocket. The administration's budget proposal includes research money for such a rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was no more than that,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''It was part of the existing budget request.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the e-mail message, Mr. Coats wrote that General Bolden would soon meet with Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology. Mr. Coats mentioned three priorities: development of a spacecraft, development of a heavy-lift rocket and a rocket test program. That would largely match Constellation's components.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama will spell out his vision for the future of American astronauts in space at a conference that the administration is planning for Florida next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pleases Florida lawmakers, who have criticized the administration's desire to eliminate NASA's program to send astronauts back to the Moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The president's upcoming space meeting here in Florida provides a chance for meaningful progress,'' said Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center. She requested a meeting when she and others in the state Congressional delegation met last month with Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, and John P. Holdren, Mr. Obama's science adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conference will be held April 15. A White House spokesman said Monday that other details, including the agenda, the location and who would be attending, were not yet available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has spent five years and $9 billion on the Constellation moon program. The president's 2011 budget would cancel all of it. The budget also seeks to nurture the commercial space industry by turning to private companies for transportation to the International Space Station and and to invest in new technologies to make future exploration of the solar system easier and cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget request would increase NASA's budget by $300 million, to $19 billion. Mr. Obama, however, has said little publicly about the future of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an area where presidential leadership can have an impact in getting acceptance on the new strategy,'' said John M. Logsdon, a space policy expert at George Washington University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said he hoped Mr. Obama would use the meeting to lay out a goal and a timetable for sending astronauts to Mars. Mr. Nelson has suggested continuing parts of Constellation, including the Orion crew capsule and the Ares I rocket as a test vehicle for a future heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the administration called Constellation ''fundamentally un-executable'' on Sunday in announcing the meeting, the program passed a two-day preliminary design review last week. In an e-mail message to people working on Constellation, Lauri N. Hansen, the lead for systems engineering and integration, wrote, ''The final results showed that we have a sound design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph R. Fragola, a safety consultant, said the review had found no critical flaws for Constellation. ''Money is the problem,'' he said. ''It's not technical.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blue-ribbon panel concluded last year that NASA would need a boost of $4.5 billion to $6 billion a year for Constellation to achieve its Moon goals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about aviation industry advertising in the early years of the space age misstated the year of the Apollo 13 mission, in which the crew of a crippled spacecraft was brought safely back to earth. It was 1970, not 1969.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Mar 13 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was ''Mad Men'' meets ''Flash Gordon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The years from 1957 to 1962 were a golden age of science fiction, as well as paranoia and exhilaration on a cosmic scale. The future was still the future back then, some of us could dream of farms on the moon and heroically finned rockets blasting off from alien landscapes. Others worried about Russian moon bases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists debated whether robots or humans should explore space. Satellites and transistors were jazzy emblems of postwar technology, and we were about to unravel the secrets of the universe and tame the atom (if it did not kill us first).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most extravagant of these visions of the future came not from cheap paperbacks, but from corporations buffing their high-tech credentials and recruiting engineering talent in the heady days when zooming budgets for defense and NASA had created a gold rush in outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the pages of magazines like Aviation Week, Missiles and Rockets and even Fortune, companies, some famous and some now obscure, were engaged in a sort of leapfrog of dreams. And so, for example, Republic Aviation of Farmingdale, N.Y. -- ''Designers and Builders of the Incomparable Thundercraft'' -- could be found bragging in Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine in 1959 about the lunar gardening experiments it was doing for a future Air Force base on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or the American Bosch Arma Corporation showing off, in Fortune, its ''Cosmic Butterfly,'' a solar-powered electrically propelled vehicle to ferry passengers and cargo across the solar system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Americans never saw these concoctions, but now they have been collected and dissected by Megan Prelinger, an independent historian and space buff, in a new book, ''Another Science Fiction: Advertising the Space Race 1957-1962.'' It is being published on May 25 by Blast Books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Prelinger and her husband, Rick, operate the Prelinger Library, a private research library in San Francisco with a heavy emphasis on media, technology and landscape history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message, Ms. Prelinger said she had grown up ''on a cultural diet of science fiction and space,'' memories of the moon landings and ''Star Trek'' merging in her mind. ''As a result,'' she said, ''I grew up believing that I was a junior member of an advanced technological society.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The book, she said, was inspired by a shipment of old publications to the library, including Aviation Week &amp;Space Technology and Missiles and Rockets. ''I little expected that the advertising in their pages would seize my attention more than the articles themselves,'' she writes in the introduction to her book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ads are chock-full of modernist energy and rich in iconography in ways Ms. Prelinger is happy to elaborate on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late '50s were also the years of the Organization Man. The cover illustration, from an insurance ad, shows a man in a gray flannel suit who is a dead ringer for the existentially confused Don Draper of ''Mad Men,'' floating alarmed and bewildered among the planets and stars. Time and again, the mountains and valleys of the moon, for example, are portrayed as if they were the mountains, canyons and deserts of the American West, making the space program just another chapter in the ongoing narrative of Manifest Destiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one illustration, the hands of God and Adam from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling have been transformed into a giant pair of space gloves reaching for each other. In another, the silhouette of a spaceship forms a cross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These images suggest that the furthest reach of what humankind hoped to find in space was in fact the very essence of infinity,'' Ms. Prelinger writes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leafing through this book is a walk down my own memory lane. I grew up in Seattle, which was a one-company town dominated by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>. Almost everybody worked there sooner or later. My best friend's father helped design the Saturn V rocket that lifted humans to the moon. After limping out of M.I.T. with a physics degree in the late '60s, I, too, worked there for a year, playing a kind of space war -- shooting high-speed aluminum balls at sheets of aluminum arrayed to simulate the structures of aircraft or spacecraft, to see what the damage would be under various conditions. At the end of the day, my desk was buried in piles of sharp dented and charred sheets of aluminum. I had to count all the holes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to know what to be more nostalgic about, all those childhood dreams of space opera or the optimism of an era in which imagination and technology were booming and every other ad ended with a pitch to come work for the thriving company of the future. ''To advance yourself professionally, you should become a member of one these teams. Write to N. M. Pagan,'' reads a typical notice from the Martin Company, now part of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't hear that much these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, you, too, sitting at a drafting table or in a cubicle, designing antennas or self-locking nuts among acres of such boards and cubicles -- ''Reaching for the Moon, Mr. Designer?'' reads a Kaylock ad -- could be a space hero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course it was almost exclusively men depicted in the ads. One exception was an ad from the National Cash Register Company for a new electronic machine for posting checks. ''And what the POST-TRONIC does electronically the operator cannot do wrong -- because she doesn't do it at all!'' says the ad showing a woman floating in space at the machine's console.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, there was a hook to those recruitment ads, as Ms. Prelinger points out. The real business of most of those aerospace companies was not the space program but defense -- building fighters, bombers, missiles and other implements of the cold war, not to mention commercial airliners. For many of these places, the space program was more of a hindrance than a boost to the bottom line, a sort of prestigious loss leader to attract cutting-edge talent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, as Ms. Prelinger reports, the darker side of this work bled through into the trade press and the ads, like when the Marquardt Corporation, which made small control rockets for satellites, showed a spy satellite aiming its lens down at Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the space fever began in 1957 with Sputnik, it cooled by 1962, when the basic plan for the Apollo moon missions was set and there was no more space for imaginations to run wild. Also, by then NASA's budget was leveling off. Ms. Prelinger said that during this period about half a million engineers, scientists, draftsmen and other people followed the clarion call to blend their talents into the new age, swelling the ranks of aerospace workers to more than a million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of them might have wound up like me. When the ''impact mechanics'' group was downsized, I was sent to the ''weights and measures'' group. Our job was to scrutinize rocket blueprints to determine the position and weight of every nut, bolt, washer and any other item on a small upper-stage booster that was to deliver an unknown payload to orbit. The information could be entered into a computer program that would calculate the center of gravity and other dynamical properties of the rocket package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was essential but brain-numbing work, and I learned a lot about shooting rubber bands from the wars that broke out every day after lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was men and women like these, working in cubicles, who saved the astronauts of Apollo 13 in 1969, by figuring out how to bring them back from the moon alive in a crippled spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the moon landings and then the end of the cold war, many of those jobs, exciting or not, disappeared, as did many of the companies that advertised them. What has not disappeared in all these years and decades is the yearning and arguing about space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're still fighting about what NASA should do as far as human exploration of the universe is concerned, collectively looking more and more like that bewildered advertising man floating in space on the cover of Ms. Prelinger's fascinating book. The argument has been going on for my whole life. Since those advertisements appeared, the United States invaded Vietnam and left; the Soviet Union crumbled and China rose; the whole nation stopped smoking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We never did find the essence of infinity -- at least not yet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the standard histories of the universe there are so many impossible things to believe before breakfast, as the White Queen put it in ''Through the Looking Glass'' -- black holes, antigravity, dark matter and all those sneaky subatomic particles zipping through us -- that the strangest and most amazing part of the universe gets short shrift. That would be us, collections of space junk, somehow perceiving and pondering the grandiosity that gave us birth in a sort of intellectual and emotional equivalent of the snake eating its tail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the point of ''Ouroboros: The History of the Universe,'' a 3-D visual collage of vibrating mandalas, exploding galaxies, astronauts and corporate logos, among much more, on six screens, all in the service of reconnecting consciousness and cosmos. It's now running in a darkened basement at the Ise Cultural Foundation in SoHo. Put on your 3-D glasses -- what isn't 3-D these days? -- and plug yourself back into the cosmos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show was created by Ali Hossaini, a biochemist turned philosopher turned television producer turned visual poet, and a pair of video artists and programmers, Blake Shaw and Bruno Levy, a k a Sweatshoppe, who devised the 3-D effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ouroboros, as the Greeks called the snake that eats its tail, has from ancient times been a symbol of cosmic unity and self-sufficiency. Dr. Hossaini says his mission here is to reverse what he calls the ''fractionalizing of culture'' that began with modern science, industry and art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One consequence of that split is the continuing ravaging of the environment, he believes. ''We know we're pillaging our habitat, but we can't make the leap from knowledge to right action,'' he writes in a statement that accompanies the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Art cannot be science,'' he goes on, ''but it can convey the sense of wonder that drives scientists. It can visualize the worlds of science while honoring our sense of self as beings that transcend the mundane'' -- and thereby, he suggests, help us remember who and where we are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The show's six screens are arranged in triptychs at either end of a long, dark room. At one end, a series of mandalalike ''sacred shapes'' made up of circles, triangles, squares -- forms that have recurred in mythological and artistic representations of the cosmos -- bounce out of the walls, evolving and morphing into cylinders, Slinkys, and other configurations. There is a red dot front and center, representing, Dr. Hossaini explained, the omnipresent center from which perception and creation proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other end of the room is heavy on astronomical, geological and biological content, with a multilayered history of the universe, from the big bang to the Moon landings, flashing across the screens. The images flip in and out of visibility so fast that they almost register subliminally: comets, volcanic flows, galaxies and chemical symbols, among others, from a reservoir of 30,000 images pulled from the Internet. These images are constantly being reshuffled, as the artists, who met each other only last December, learn how to drive their show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quality of the 3-D is not likely to make you forget ''Avatar,'' and Dr. Hossaini isn't really interested in teaching you the mechanics of the expansion of the universe or the divergence of the species; this is not a planetarium or museum show. There is the sensation at one point of flying through a star field, but we recognize no constellation, nor do we arrive at any star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At other moments moons, comets and volcanoes burst forth, but unconnected to familiar surroundings, they seem alien. Human faces appear, but we don't know who they are. The show's collaborators appear to have decided to bypass the rational part of the brain and head straight for someplace deeper, to make us experience the universe not as a concatenation of forces but as a poem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewers can roam around or just sit on a mattress on the floor and let their eyes do the wandering. The result is trippy. I felt as if I were watching two shows, one -- the sacred images in front -- cold and abstract, but hypnotic; the other warmer and full of meaning, if somewhat predictable. Still, the two inform and at times reinforce each other. Near the end of the ''history,'' for example, the logos of companies like <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> predominate in the background. These corporations are the evolved building blocks of modern culture, economics and politics (having even been granted personhood by the Supreme Court). Their logos have become the sacred shapes of our own time, just as the geometric shapes at the other end of the room were said by sages to be the soul of nature, building blocks of the world. I felt a click of my psyche reconnecting, the snake chomping down on its sacred tail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An hour spent on the floor interviewing Dr. Hossaini and his colleagues (who all spend time at the show every day and ''very much want to discuss the work'' with visitors, he told me later) left me feeling transported back to 1969, when animated discussions of issues of cosmic import could go on all night on similarly unadorned floors, under the influence of slightly different stimulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hossaini said that he (and the show) was partial to panspermia, the idea that life originated somewhere else -- Mars, giant clouds in the Milky Way -- and migrated to Earth, floating through space. That is a science-fiction-sounding idea that, as of yet, no astronomer can knock down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, the presence of comets in the show testifies to the theory, held by many astronomers, that the Earth got its water from being bombarded by comets, which are just ''dirty snowballs'' in the lexicon, early in cosmic history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Hossaini said he liked the idea that water was brought to Earth from space. I replied that in fact everything on Earth came from space. He laughed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're stardust,'' somebody in the dark said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the Large Hadron Collider referred incorrectly to the cooling effect of the Big Bang. It was the universe -- not the Earth -- that the Big Bang caused to coolfrom billions or trillions of degrees to superfrigid temperatures today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Apr 11 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those whose physics knowledge was a bit rusty, the news about the Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest physics machine, might have been puzzling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the collider finally crashed subatomic particles into one another last week, but why, exactly, is that important? Here is a primer on the collider - with just enough information, hopefully, to impress guests at your next cocktail party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's be basic. What does a particle physicist do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particle physicists have one trick that they do over and over again, which is to smash things together and watch what comes tumbling out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does it mean to say that the collider will allow physicists to go back to the Big Bang? Is the collider a time machine?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Physicists suspect that the laws of physics evolved as the universe cooled from billions or trillions of degrees in the first moments of the Big Bang to superfrigid temperatures today (3 degrees Kelvin) -- the way water changes from steam to liquid to ice as temperatures decline. As the universe cooled, physicists suspect, everything became more complicated. Particles and forces once indistinguishable developed their own identities, the way Spanish, French and Italian diverged from the original Latin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By crashing together subatomic particles -- protons -- physicists create little fireballs that revisit the conditions of these earlier times and see what might have gone on back then, sort of like the scientists in Jurassic Park reincarnating dinosaurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collider, which is outside Geneva, is 17 miles around. Why is it so big?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Einstein taught us that energy and mass are equivalent. So, the more energy packed into a fireball, the more massive it becomes. The collider has to be big and powerful enough to pack tremendous amounts of energy into a proton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the faster the particles travel, the harder it is to bend their paths in a circle, so that they come back around and bang into each other. The collider is designed so that protons travel down the centers of powerful electromagnets that are the size of redwood trunks, which bend the particles' paths into circles, creating a collision. Although the electromagnets are among the strongest ever built, they still can't achieve a turning radius for the protons of less than 2.7 miles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All in all, the bigger the accelerator, the bigger the crash, and the better chance of seeing what is on nature's menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are physicists hoping to see?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to some theories, a whole list of items that haven't been seen yet -- with names like gluinos, photinos, squarks and winos -- because we haven't had enough energy to create a big enough collision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any one of these particles, if they exist, could constitute the clouds of dark matter, which, astronomers tell us, produce the gravity that holds galaxies and other cosmic structures together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another missing link of physics is a particle known as the Higgs boson, after Peter Higgs of the University of Edinburgh, which imbues other particles with mass by creating a cosmic molasses that sticks to them and bulks them up as they travel along, not unlike the way an entourage forms around a rock star when they walk into a club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have scientists ever seen dark matter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's invisible, but astronomers have deduced from their measurements of galactic motions that the visible elements of the cosmos, like galaxies, are embedded in huge clouds of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will physicists see these gluinos, photinos, squarks and winos?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no guarantee that any will be discovered, which is what makes science fun, as well as nerve-racking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how much energy do you need to create these fireballs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Large Hadron Collider, that energy is now 3.5 trillion electron volts per proton -- about as much energy as a flea requires to do a pushup. That may not sound like much, but for a tiny proton, it is a lot of energy. It is the equivalent of a 200-pound man bulking up by 700,000 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's an electron volt?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An electron volt is the amount of energy an electron would gain passing from the negative to the positive side of a one-volt battery. It is the basic unit of energy and of mass preferred by physicists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When protons collide, is there a big bang?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no sound. It's not like a bomb exploding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In previous trials, there was an actual explosion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that current is dangerous. During the testing of the collider in September 2008, the electrical connection between a pair of the giant magnets vaporized. There are thousands of such connections in the collider, many of which are now believed to be defective. As a result the collider can only run at half-power for the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could the collider make a black hole and destroy the Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collider is not going to do anything that high-energy cosmic rays have not done repeatedly on Earth and elsewhere in the universe. There is no evidence that such collisions have created black holes or that, if they have, the black holes have caused any damage. According to even the most speculative string theory variations on black holes, the Large Hadron Collider is not strong enough to produce a black hole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too bad, because many physicists would dearly like to see one.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Lighting up the predawn sky, the space shuttle Discovery climbed out of darkness and into the glare of the rising sun early Monday, putting on a spectacular sky show as it thundered away on a mission to resupply the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrying a crew of seven and 10 tons of supplies and equipment, the Discovery lifted off from Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 6:21 a.m. after a problem-free countdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riding atop a rushing plume of fire from the ship's twin solid-fuel boosters, the fuel-laden 4.5-million-pound spacecraft accelerated through 100 m.p.h. -- straight up -- in just seven seconds, majestically wheeling about to line up on a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching was timed for the moment when Earth's rotation moved the pad into the orbital plane of the space station. The laboratory complex streaked above the Florida spaceport 15 minutes before the shuttle's liftoff, a brilliant target hurtling through space at five miles per second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Discovery's climb to orbit appeared uneventful, with no obvious signs of problems. A camera mounted on the side of the ship's external tank showed a few pieces of presumably foam insulation falling away halfway through the ascent, but it was well after the period when debris poses a serious threat to the shuttle's heat shield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts did run into a problem later with the shuttle's Ku-band antenna, used to send data and video to the ground via NASA satellites. Without the antenna, the analysis of a heat shield inspection scheduled for Tuesday will be delayed, and the commander, Capt. Alan G. Poindexter of the Navy, and the pilot, Col. James P. Dutton of the Air Force, will not be able to use the antenna in radar mode during docking with the space station around 3:44 a.m. on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the mission timeline will most likely have to be adjusted, NASA officials said the antenna problem would not affect the goals set for the Discovery's visit. Waiting to welcome the seven shuttle fliers will be the station's Expedition 23 crew of five men and one woman, including two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut who arrived at the lab early Sunday aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're absolutely delighted to have our friends and comrades joining us here in a couple of days,'' Col. Timothy J. Creamer of the Army said by radio from the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Stand by for a knock on the door,'' a flight controller replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Discovery's mission under way, only three shuttle flights remain as the space agency races to complete the international laboratory before retiring the orbiters this year. The station is essentially complete, but NASA is trying to stock the lab with spare parts and equipment as a hedge against potential problems after the station becomes dependent on smaller, less capable Russian, Japanese and European cargo craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three spacewalks are planned by Richard A. Mastracchio, a shuttle veteran, and Clayton C. Anderson, who spent six months on the station in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven Discovery crew members -- Captain Poindexter; Colonel Dutton; the flight engineer, Dottie M. Metcalf-Lindenburger; Stephanie D. Wilson; Mr. Anderson; Mr. Mastracchio; and a Japanese astronaut, Naoko Yamazaki -- are scheduled to undock from the space station on April 16 and land back at the Kennedy Space Center two days later.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What goes through an astronaut's head when things go wrong, and he is floating in space 350 miles above the Earth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six days into a mission last May to repair and rehabilitate the Hubble Space Telescope, Michael J. Massimino, an astronaut, robotics expert and honorary New York City fireman, was getting ready to rip a handrail off the side of the fabled telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beneath the handrail, behind a panel secured by 111 tiny screws, was a broken spectrograph needing electronic repair to go back to its job, which included inspecting faraway planets. Dr. Massimino had trained for years to do this on-orbit ''brain surgery,'' but first, having stripped a crucial bolt, he would have to resort to brute force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino's thoughts, he recalled recently over lunch in New York, flew back to his boyhood and the day his Uncle Frank couldn't get the oil filter off his car. At one point, his father ran across the street, came back with a giant screwdriver, and punched it through the filter to get leverage to pry it off. After yanking, and cursing, ''Finally he got the thing to budge,'' Dr. Massimino said. ''That's what I was thinking when I was yanking on the handle on the Hubble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been reliving that moment in talks and interviews for the last year. Now, the whole world can as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Atlantis, commanded by Scott D. Altman, shipped off from Cape Canaveral, in addition to seven astronauts and thousands of pounds of tools and replacement instruments, it carried a special 575-pound Imax camera that recorded the action, including Dr. Massimino's cosmic yank, in 3-D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 19, ''Hubble 3D,'' a 40-minute film about the Hubble repair, directed by Toni Myers and narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio, opened in Imax theaters and science centers around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides bone-rattling liftoffs and astronauts goofing around in the space shuttle, the film features trips through the Hubble images themselves. In Imax and 3-D, the astronauts' tethers brush your hair in some scenes and stars hit your face like raindrops in a summer storm in others. One scene shows a Hubble image I hadn't seen before, of a protoplanetary disk of dust looking like a ring of hair, or a nest, surrounding a newly born star in the Orion nebula -- Genesis there, maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the film's last image, a cosmic web of light formed by the galaxies on large scale, the universe seems to glow like a crystal emerging from the dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the scenes in the movie were converted to 3-D using digital tricks, Ms. Myers of Imax, the director, said, but about eight minutes were recorded by a single 5,400-foot roll of film in that camera in the shuttle's cargo bay, operated remotely by the pilot, Gregory C. Johnson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recording left and right images on alternate frames of film running sideways through the camera at 48 frames per second, eight minutes was all the time they could capture. The Imax team spent many hours with crew members as they rehearsed the mission in a water tank to make sure they got the crucial moments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting film, Ms. Myers said, is the culmination of 25 years of flying Imax cameras on space shuttles and the training of more than 100 astronauts to run them. ''We trained them to be directors in space,'' she said. It is a tradition that will end with the retirement of the space shuttle next year, she said, because there is no room on the Soyuz capsules that will replace it to bring back the film packages, which are as big as a pizza box and three inches thick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film has made something of a media star out of Dr. Massimino, who is seen not only fixing the telescope but also conducting chatty low-key interviews with his crewmates in space. He has also been on the road promoting the film and most recently rang the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino was born in 1962 and grew up in Franklin Square on Long Island, two miles out of Queens. The son of an inspector for the New York City Fire Department, he is the kind of astronaut who would bring the home plate from Shea Stadium up in space with him. He was inspired to join the space program, he said, by the camaraderie between the astronauts in the 1983 movie ''The Right Stuff,'' based on the book by Tom Wolfe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Something about that closeness and how they stood up for each other caught my attention,'' he recalled. ''My real interest was not in flying but the camaraderie between a group of people and being up there and being able to see the Earth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking a way into the program, Dr. Massimino enrolled at M.I.T., eventually emerging in 1992 with a Ph.D. in robotics. He joined NASA in 1996 and lucked out by being assigned to the fourth Hubble repair mission in 2002, on which he performed two spacewalks. He packed along all kinds of fire department and Port Authority mementoes in honor of the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May's mission, the last ever to the telescope, reunited Dr. Massimino with some of the 2002 crew, including Commander Altman, who had led the previous mission, and the veteran Hubble repairman John M. Grunsfeld. Among Dr. Massimino's duties was to become the first person to use Twitter from space, as @Astro--Mike, sending down posts to more than 1.2 million followers. It was NASA's idea, he said. ''They wanted a guinea pig.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing video interviews in flight was his idea, he said, inspired by a complaint by a crewmate that the one-on-one interviews done by NASA were too dry. None of the camaraderie and banter he enjoyed with his crew came through. ''We're funny and we fix things, but we were portrayed as stiffs. I wanted people to see us as people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was easy for me to do, just film stuff and send it down,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the Atlantis blasted off, on May 11, Hubble was in bad shape, limping along on one 17-year-old camera and a backup data router. Five spacewalks were planned and in the end, despite years of training and engineering, none of them was easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bad moment occurred out of camera range during Dr. Massimino's first spacewalk of the mission. While he was scouring the cargo bay for a spare gyroscope to replace one that wouldn't fit, he was carrying on his shoulder a cable harness needed to supply power for a repair of Hubble's main camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somehow the hook got undone,'' he recalled. ''I look up and up above me I saw this harness is going away.'' There was only one; without it the camera could not be repaired. He grabbed it just in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Massimino's worst moment, however, came two days later when he could not unscrew the last bolt holding the handrail that was blocking the broken spectrograph. ''That was a nightmare for me,'' he said. ''I felt horrible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whether we were going to find life on other planets was now down to zero.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luckily, when he yanked, the handrail came off cleanly. ''I went from the lowest I had ever been to the happiest I had ever been outside a spaceship,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the mission succeeded brilliantly. Within weeks of their letting the telescope back loose into space, one of the new cameras installed on Hubble recorded images of the most distant galaxies ever seen, from an era only 500 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the shuttle program set to wind down this year or next, Dr. Massimino said there was little chance of him getting to space again anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing the Earth from space, he said, was his favorite activity, and watching the movie brings it back. ''Those were the most memorable moments of my life. You don't want to forget.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the stubborn handrail? Dr. Massimino said it was now in an office at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., where the engineers in charge of Hubble work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They let me keep it for a day, but I had to give it back,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration fleshed out plans for the coming years on Thursday by announcing a lineup of new programs and those NASA centers that would be responsible for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's plan for space, announced this year, would terminate the Constellation program, which was to develop rockets to return humans to the moon. It would focus instead on developing commercial flights of crew and cargo to the International Space Station and long-range technology to allow sustained exploration, including by humans, beyond Earth's orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a one-hour telephone news conference, the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., and his deputy, Lori Garver, took turns rattling off names and price tags of new programs at each NASA center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them is an effort known as Flagship Technology Demonstrations, intended to test things like orbital fuel depots and using planetary atmospheres instead of braking rockets to land safely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That program would cost $6 billion over the next five years and would be run by the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The Kennedy Space Center in Florida is to get $5.8 billion over five years to develop a commercial program for carrying cargo and astronauts to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new programs, General Bolden said, were ''extending the frontiers of exploration beyond the wildest dreams of the early space pioneers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was then questioned by reporters who wanted to know why some members of Congress thought this was the end of human spaceflight and about the lack of a long-term goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With all due respect to everybody,'' the general replied, ''a serious and real concern for everyone is the jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As technology advances, there are fewer and ''fewer manual-type jobs,'' he explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Constellation, several thousand jobs were going to be lost. ''I think that is a significant issue for people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said that since NASA's budget request was going up in the next five years, a result would be more jobs nationwide and agencywide rather than fewer. There might be a rebirth, he hoped, of people going into aeronautics or earth science.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will President Obama's plan for space exploration bring us closer to Mars -- or is it a step backward for those who favor human exploration of the solar system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my Findings column, I discuss some potential advantages of Mr. Obama's plan to encourage private companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> to take over some jobs formerly performed by NASA. You can read more about <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and its president, Elon Musk, in this article by my colleague Ken Chang. I can understand people's enduring affection for NASA -- I still thrill to see the space shuttle take off -- but I don't think we'll get to Mars unless entrepreneurs Mr. Musk can sharply reduce the costs of the journey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I also recommend a thoughtful article in The New Atlantis by Rand Simberg, an aerospace engineer who runs the Transterrestrial Musings blog. In the article, he discusses ways to cut costs in space by shaking up NASA's structure and by encouraging private companies. "Just as war is too important to be left to the generals, man's future in space is too important to be left to NASA," he writes, and elaborates:We have had a monolithic government space agency for half a century at a cumulative cost of roughly half a trillion dollars (in current-year dollars). If we are going to continue to spend that order of magnitude of money-as, for political reasons, it seems we are going to do indefinitely-we should at least have something more to show for it than just a couple hundred brief trips to orbit for elite civil servants at an average cost over that period of about a couple billion dollars per flight. NASA needn't do all the work of making space affordable and sustainable, but it ought to do something. To put it another way, it isn't NASA's job to put humans on Mars; it's NASA's job to make it possible for the National Geographic Society, or an offshoot of the Latter-Day Saints, or an adventure tourism company, to put humans on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics of Mr. Obama's plan worry that cutbacks at NASA -- in particular the cancellation of the lunar mission planned by Bush administration -- would jeopardize future space exploration by eliminating the jobs of engineers with irreplaceable expertise. Katherine Mangu Ward, my former Times colleague, has a reply at Reason to that concern:Luckily, we are not living in the 17th century Mughal empire of Shah Jahan, of whom it is rumored that to protect the secrets of the Taj Mahal and guarantee that it remain unique he cut off the hands of the architect who designed it. For good measure, he killed, maimed, or blinded the builders as well. Nor are we in the second century B.C. under the reign of Qin Shi Huang, who had his now-famous tomb stocked with thousands of life-sized terra cotta warriors-and then proceeded to kill all of the workers on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Included in the proposed changes to the NASA budget: $6 billion to firms, including startups, focused on developing technologies necessary for human transport to and from the International Space Station. Surely some of that cash will be used to snap up the truly experienced and unique space workers.Now it's your turn. Where should humans be going in space, and how should we get there?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, the aerospace giants with decades of experience working on America's space program, will happily sell rockets to carry astronauts into space, but the companies are leery about taking a leading role in President Obama's vision for a revamped National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of NASA relying on smaller companies -- unproven upstarts in the view of critics -- could create yet another hurdle in convincing an already skeptical Congress of the idea of relying on commercial companies to provide taxi transportation to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think there is a business case for us,'' John Karas, vice president and general manager of human spaceflight at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, said about space taxis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Publicly, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has been enthusiastic. ''We have a vested interest in the International Space Station,'' Brewster H. Shaw, vice president and general manager of <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s NASA Systems business unit, said in February after NASA awarded the company $18 million to draw up a preliminary design of a capsule that could serve as the basis of a commercial crew system. ''We want to see I.S.S. live up to its potential by having a robust logistics for the delivery of cargo and crew.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed by military contractors, said <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> is more skeptical in private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> began pursuing the commercial space business through an international partnership called Sea Launch; it also developed the Delta IV rocket to launch both military and commercial satellites. The company lost money in both efforts, with Sea Launch filing for bankruptcy in 2009. To stem the Delta IV losses, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, which was also losing money with its Atlas V rocket, set up a joint venture called the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Senior <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> executives have told me that they are skeptical about new launch opportunities, given the losses they incurred on previous initiatives such as Sea Launch and the Pentagon's expendable launcher program,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''They are unlikely to invest large amounts of money on the new NASA vision.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has called for the cancellation of NASA's current Constellation program to send astronauts back to the Moon. In its place, the administration would like to spend $6 billion over five years to finance the development of rockets and crew capsules by commercial companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials have said the program would be set up to attract new and established companies. The money would most likely be split between two or more companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In pitching the idea, administration officials have said that commercial companies have always built the rockets and spacecraft that carried American astronauts and that it would not be a radical shift to turn to aerospace companies with decades of experience. They also contend that competition would spur innovation and drive down the launching costs, which, in turn, would open vibrant new markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has not described details of the planned competition, and the companies said they would take a look at what the agency proposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Assuming the business case is right, we're all in,'' said Keith Reiley, program manager for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s capsule development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business case depends on how much money NASA will be asking the companies to invest. In traditional ''cost plus'' development, NASA pays for everything. In that case, Mr. Reilly said, ''of course, we'd be happy to do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If NASA were to ask the companies to shoulder all of the financial risk, however, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> would certainly not participate. The key would be how the $6 billion would be divided. ''Hopefully,'' Mr. Reilly said, ''those issues will get resolved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed were stung during the last burst of optimism for the commercial space business about a decade ago. They invested several billion dollars -- Lockheed to develop its Atlas V, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> for the Delta IV -- in the hopes that the huge market for commercial satellites would supplement their traditional business of launching American military spy satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market did not materialize, and what business there was went to European and Russian rockets that were cheaper. With the <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> share costs and profits equally. The joint venture now operates in the black, but the companies did not recoup their original investments, and much of the infrastructure they built remains underused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think people who have been in the launcher business for many years find it hard to take the president's plan seriously,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''They think it sounds like an elaborate wake for the human spaceflight program more than a plan for moving forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hoped-for commercial market for space taxis hinges on one small company, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> of Las Vegas, which is teaming up with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> on its capsule design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded by Robert T. Bigelow, a real estate investor who made a fortune with the Budget Suites hotel chain, <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> is developing inflatable space habitats that it hopes to market as research facilities to companies and foreign nations looking to establish a space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's plans are ambitious. It is already negotiating with <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span> for seven Atlas V launches in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That nearly doubles the output of the Atlas V in any given year,'' said Michael N. Gold, director of Bigelow's Washington office. ''It's really a snowball effect here,'' he said, with economies of scale expected to drive down the costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result of the launches in 2014 would be a private space station that could house 12 astronauts -- twice as many as the International Space Station. Plans call for a second, even larger Bigelow station two years later, with room for 24 astronauts. The company projected 148 to 176 launches between 2014 and 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're extremely confident in the market,'' Mr. Gold said. The only missing pieces, he said, are the rockets to carry people to and from the Bigelow stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Bigelow's plans do not unfold as the company projects, and if NASA were the only customer, the space taxi business might be too small -- perhaps just two flights a year to the International Space Station -- and too risky for <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> or <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> to invest much time and money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James McAleese, a defense consultant in McLean, Va., said that large aerospace firms like <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed typically generate returns of 11 percent or 12 percent on their investments, and that for riskier enterprises like space, the companies would be looking for even higher returns. ''I don't believe there's a burning desire to get into the spacecraft piece of the business,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a commercial market developed, that could still be a lucrative business, said Mr. Karas, of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, who once led the company's expendable rockets business. But he added, ''Personally, this is exactly the same rhetoric as last time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed declined to bid directly on NASA's plans, at least some of the astronauts would probably be traveling in Atlas Vs or Delta IVs built by those companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA competition may seek proposals solely for spacecraft -- the crew capsules or winged craft atop the rockets -- rather than the rockets themselves. The spacecraft makers would specify which rocket a craft would launch on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One likely bidder, <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span> of Hawthorne, Calif., is developing both a crew capsule, the Dragon, and its own rocket, the Falcon 9. Other possible competitors, like Blue Origin, a start-up by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, would build only the capsule and put it on top of an existing rocket, with the most likely choice being <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>'s Atlas V.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The joint venture would sell rockets -- the lower-end versions of the Atlas V cost about $150 million each -- to the spacecraft makers. Thus, the alliance -- and, indirectly, <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> -- would continue their involvement with NASA's space program, but in a secondary role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael C. Gass, president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">United Launch Alliance</span>, has said that upgrading the low-end version of the Atlas V for astronauts -- adding a monitoring system to alert controllers of problems with the rocket and modifying the launching pad to handle astronauts -- would cost $400 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you start getting into a heavier crew transfer vehicle and a dedicated launch facility, it's over a billion dollars, but less than two,'' Mr. Gass said. Those improvements ''should be funded by the U.S. government'' without additional investment from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> and Lockheed, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Bigelow already negotiating launches, Mr. Gass said, he did not yet see a definite commercial market. ''The commercial market could develop,'' he said. ''Right now, we're approaching it as incremental.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- During his trip to the Kennedy Space Center this week, President Obama will be confronted with an awkward political reality: when it comes to space exploration, sometimes even Republicans can be passionate advocates for the public option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've joined with Democratic colleagues in Congress to oppose Mr. Obama's plan to reduce NASA's missions and to encourage private companies' rockets to haul cargo and astronauts into space. Mr. Obama's critics accuse him of abandoning NASA's glorious trailblazing tradition -- and maybe, if your constituents have jobs at NASA, it's possible to see something pioneering about an agency whose flagship goes a few hundred miles into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four decades after the moon landing, why isn't NASA venturing somewhere more exotic? The glory days of the Apollo moon missions were possible only because of the race against the Soviet Union, and Mr. Obama could revive that spirit by starting a new space race. But not if he gives in to demands to keep NASA wobbling along in current fashion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main problem with NASA is not lack of money. Its current budget is about the same size, when adjusted for inflation, as the average during the 1960s and early 1970s. But space exploration has become so costly that this level of financing won't even pay for a return to the Moon anytime soon, which is what prompted the White House to cancel the Bush administration's lunar mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, once a pioneer makes the first trip somewhere, the cost goes down as others follow and technology improves. That's why so many colonists could follow Columbus to the New World, and why the masses today can afford to fly in Lindbergh's path back to Europe. The real costs of shipping freight by rail and air have declined by an order of magnitude since locomotives and airplanes were invented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In space transportation, though, many costs have actually risen since the days of Apollo. NASA estimates that each seven-person space shuttle mission now costs about $65 million per astronaut, and outside experts say the true cost, once you add in all shuttle-related expenses, is double or triple that figure. Even a cramped trip to the space station on the Russian government's Soyuz will cost the United States more than $50 million per astronaut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elon Musk has promised to do the job for just $20 million by building his own rocket, which is being readied for a test launch next month. His company, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, is saving money through innovations like assembling the rocket horizontally inside a prefab hangar here at Cape Canaveral, thereby avoiding the costs of the customized towers and scaffolding used by NASA to assemble its rockets vertically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important innovation for the space program, Mr. Musk said, would be to get away from the old ''cost plus'' model in which NASA contractors are guaranteed a profit on top of whatever costs they incur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The cost-plus approach encourages aerospace companies to find the most expensive way to do something and drag it out as long as possible,'' said</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk, the entrepreneur who co-founded <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>. ''Future contracts should be given to meet milestones based on objective design reviews and actual hardware completion. If a company meets the milestone, they get paid. If not, they don't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Obama's new plan, there would be further encouragement for <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> and other private companies. The traditional aerospace companies remain leery of the plans, as my colleague Ken Chang reported Monday, but there are other upstarts besides <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> working on projects to get humans into space, and they would be potential competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While private companies would ferry humans and cargo into orbit, NASA would be redirected into basic research and development of technologies for trips far beyond Earth, according to Mr. Obama's plan. This R&amp;D, as White House officials are quick to note in preparation for their Florida trip, would provide jobs in some of the Congressional districts affected by the closing of the shuttle and lunar programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, it could make sense for NASA to be doing the high-risk advanced research that could yield breakthroughs for a trip to Mars. But how much progress would NASA actually make?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to encourage innovation would be to convert some of NASA's divisions into versions of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which has successfully sent robotic probes across the solar system. The laboratory is financed by NASA but operated by CalTech, and therefore freer to innovate outside of political and Civil Service constraints. A presidential commission in 2004 recommendedthat NASA convert some of its research centers to this academic model, but the agency's bureaucracy showed little interest in surrendering control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to prod NASA would be to set specific goals. Robert Zubrin, the president of the Mars Society, argues that NASA has been effective only when given a definite destination and hard timetable -- the Apollo Mode, as he calls it, which is still used successfully on robotic missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the moon landings, he said, the human spaceflight program has been stuck in the Shuttle Mode, in which the agency develops technologies to please bureaucratic and political constituencies. Instead of looking for the best ship to reach a goal, it looked for a goal (like the space station) to justify the ship. To Dr. Zubrin, the new Obama plan looks like more of the Shuttle Mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The plan proposes to spend $100 billion on human spaceflight over the next 10 years in order to accomplish nothing,'' he said. ''If we are going to have a NASA human spaceflight program, it must be given a goal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Zubrin would like to see NASA committed to a goal like building a ship to reach an asteroid by 2016 (a year that would just happen to fall within a second Obama term) as preparation for a journey to Mars. That's not a bad goal, although I can't see how the agency could afford to make the trip itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it could do is oversee a competition among companies like <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> or whatever nonprofit groups wanted to participate. It could offer a series of prizes, like the cash bonus that Lindbergh collected for crossing the Atlantic. Or there could be contracts given to the competitors that would be based strictly on their performance, not on their costs. (To debate these ideas, go to nytimes.com/tierneylab.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What if Mr. Obama, in Kennedyesque fashion, started a race to Mars in which NASA set milestones along the way and rewarded competitors only when they passed each one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It'd be cool to set a Mars goal,'' Mr. Musk said. ''Personally, I think it could be done in 10 years.'' Maybe he's being overoptimistic, but what's the harm in letting him -- and everyone else -- go for it?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA and General Motors announced on Tuesday that they plan to send a robot to the International Space Station, with the eventual goal of having it help out the astronauts there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there are already several robots out in space - including the famous Mars Rovers, which have been zipping around the red planet for years - NASA and G.M. said this will be the first human-like robot to leave Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The robot is called Robonaut 2, or R2 for short, and it weighs in at 300 pounds, with a head, torso and two fully functional arms. At first R2 will be monitored in space to see how it performs in weightlessness, but NASA hopes to eventually use R2 to assist astronauts during space walks and to work alongside engineers inside the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a joint press release, John Olson, director of NASA's Exploration Systems Integration Office, said: "The partnership of humans and robots will be critical to opening up the solar system and will allow us to go farther and achieve more than we can probably even imagine today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R2 will be a passenger on the Space Shuttle Discovery, which is scheduled to head to the space station in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Space Station got some attention in the blogosphere recently when Timothy Creamer, an astronaut on board the station, sent the first Tweet from space. It looks like Mr. Creamer may have a new roommate soon, although it is not yet clear whether R2 is into Twitter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama will seek to promote his vision for the nation's human space flight program on Thursday, just two days after three storied Apollo astronauts -- including Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the Moon -- called the new plans ''devastating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an announcement to be made at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the president will personally talk for the first time about the sweeping upheaval of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's human spaceflight program outlined in his 2011 budget request: canceling the current program that is to send astronauts back to the Moon, investing in commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit and developing new space technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A senior administration official said Mr. Obama would describe a vision ''that unlocks our ambitions and expands our frontiers in space, ultimately meaning the challenge of sending humans to Mars.'' The official spoke with administration approval, but on the condition of anonymity so that the comments would not upstage the president's remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget request called for the cancellation of Orion crew capsule, which was to be used to carry astronauts to the International Space Station and then to the Moon, as well as other components of the current program known as Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president will propose that a simpler version of the Orion be used as a lifeboat for the space station. Russian Soyuz capsules currently provide that function. Because the Orion lifeboat would not carry astronauts to the space station, it could be launched on existing rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official said Mr. Obama would also announce that he would commit to deciding in 2015 on a design of a heavy-lift rocket for NASA. ''This means major work on the heavy-lift rocket at least two years earlier than Constellation,'' the official said. Astronauts would leave Earth orbit in the early 2020s, the official said, destined for the Moon, asteroids and eventually Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama will also announce $40 million devoted to helping Florida adjust economically after the retirement of the space shuttles, scheduled for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The official also pointed to a study conducted by the Tauri Group, a consulting firm, and financed by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group, which estimated the president's plan would create 10,000 jobs nationally over the next five years. NASA estimates 2,500 would be in Florida along the Space Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's plan has been cheered by so-called New Space advocates who believe that traditional NASA programs are too big, too expensive and too slow and that turning to entrepreneurs will spur a vibrant new space industry. But even many of those who support the new strategy say the administration has not done a convincing job of explaining it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has not been a well-articulated plan and vision,'' said Edward F. Crawley, an engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who served on the blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others find the essentials of the plan flawed, not just the presentation. In a letter to Mr. Obama, reported Tuesday by NBC News, Mr. Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, along with James A. Lovell Jr., the commander of Apollo 13, and Eugene A. Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17, wrote, ''For the United States, the leading space-faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second- or even third-rate stature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter released Monday, 27 NASA veterans -- including Eugene F. Kranz, the flight director who presided over the safe return of the crew aboard the crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft in 1970 -- asked Mr. Obama to reconsider the ''misguided proposal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reception from Congress has so far been mostly chilly but mostly from representatives in states that are home to the NASA centers that would be most hurt by the changes -- the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Johnson Space Center in Texas and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some members of Congress from non-NASA states, like David Wu, Democrat of Oregon, have also criticized the plan, and only one, Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, has enthusiastically endorsed it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's budget -- $18.7 billion this year -- consumes a 0.5 percent sliver of the federal budget. Under Mr. Obama's plans, NASA would receive slightly more next year -- $19 billion next year -- but, in canceling Constellation, much of the money would be moved away from human spaceflight to other programs like Earth science and aeronautics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials have noted that the budget request adds $6.1 billion to NASA's budget over next five years, which they say demonstrates the president's support to the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that follows a $3.4 billion cut that Mr. Obama made last year in the five-year projection for the Constellation part of NASA's budget.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Friday about a speech by President Obama on revamping the space program referred incorrectly in some copies to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat of Texas, whose district includes parts of Houston close to Johnson Space Center. While Ms. Lee attended the president's speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, she did not travel there on Air Force One with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Mon Apr 19 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Pointing to Mars and asteroids as destinations, President Obama on Thursday forcefully countered criticisms that he was trying to end the nation's human spaceflight program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the first time that the president had lent his personal political capital in an increasingly testy fight over the future of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bottom line is, nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space than I am,'' he said in a speech to about 200 attendees of a White House-sponsored space conference here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was unwavering in insisting that NASA must change in sending people into space. ''We've got to do it in a smart way,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and we can't just keep on doing the same old things we've been doing and thinking that's going to get us where we want to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of earlier vague assurances by Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, and other administration officials that NASA would eventually venture beyond Earth orbit, Mr. Obama gave dates and destinations for astronauts. But the goals would be achieved long after he leaves office: a visit to an asteroid after 2025, reaching Mars by the mid-2030s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Step by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do,'' Mr. Obama said. ''In short, 50 years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama noted that President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to land on the Moon in 1961 -- the year the current president was born. But the plan Mr. Obama laid out for now through the 2030s was unlike the Kennedy vision: It was a call for private industry to innovate its way to Mars, rather than a call for a national effort to demonstrate American predominance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's budget request to Congress in February proposed a major shift for NASA: canceling the Constellation program, started five years ago to send astronauts back to the Moon, and turning to private companies for carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strikingly, Mr. Obama used the speech to blame his predecessors for lacking leadership on space policy and the critics of his own plan for failing to recognize that times have changed. NASA's budgets, he noted, have ''risen and fallen with the political winds.'' That appeared to be a shot at President George W. Bush, who announced a new plan for NASA after the Columbia disaster and barely mentioned space policy again for the rest of his presidency. And he argued that turning to private entrepreneurs would result in more space flights and more astronauts in orbit than the space plan he inherited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some members of Congress, particularly those in states that are home to NASA centers working on Constellation, have objected to the change, and the speech did not sway those who have been most vociferously opposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no concrete plan, no deadlines to make it happen,'' said Representative Pete Olson, Republican of Texas, whose district includes the Johnson Space Center. ''It didn't change my opinion at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama's speech contained few surprises as White House officials previewed it to reporters two days ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the small concessions to critics, Mr. Obama is now proposing to revive the Constellation's Orion crew capsule as a stripped-down version to use as a lifeboat for the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions,'' Mr. Obama said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama promised $40 million to help retrain workers in and around the Kennedy Space Center who will lose their jobs when the space shuttles are retired. He also stated that NASA would start developing a heavy-lift rocket by 2015, a promise that presumes the president's re-election in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tweaks appear to reflect political calculations. Florida and its 27 electoral votes are a likely key battleground in the next presidential election. On board Air Force One with the president on the flight to the Kennedy Space Center were two Democratic members of Congress from Florida: Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represents parts of Houston close to the Johnson Space Center, was one of the attendees. Mr. Olson, a Republican, did not receive an invitation to the conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether appeals for loyalty from Democrats would succeed in gaining Congressional support is unclear. NASA has traditionally received strong support from both political parties, and the opposition to Mr. Obama's plans has also been bipartisan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kosmas, for example, is a co-sponsor of a bill to extend operations of the space shuttles, and Mr. Nelson has pushed for continued work on Constellation rockets as precursors to a heavy-lift rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm encouraged,'' Mr. Nelson said, although he said he would continue pushing to continue development of the Constellation rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reviving Orion could mollify <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> executives upset over the proposed cancellation. The Orion work is done largely at the Johnson Space Center and at <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> facilities in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While using Orion as a space station lifeboat may be politically savvy, some space experts, particularly those associated with the Constellation program, said the economic and technical rationale for the decision eluded them. It would take about $8 billion to finish the development of the current incarnation of Orion; a simpler version would most likely still cost several billion dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the end, this seems like an expensive proposition that makes simply continuing to use the Russians for crew rescue look like a bargain,'' Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who oversaw the creation of Constellation, wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elon Musk, the chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, cheered the president's speech and policy. He said the Dragon capsule that his company is developing could also serve as a lifeboat, and its design would also allow six-month stays at the station.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it was unveiled -- in budget documents -- in February, we thought President Obama's new approach to human space flight made good sense. But it drew immediate, fierce opposition from states that feared they would lose jobs and from Congressional boosters of the traditional space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It called for scrapping the Bush administration's program to return to the Moon by 2020, which had fallen hopelessly behind schedule and relied on outdated technology. It substituted a big investment in developing new technologies to make travel farther into the solar system cheaper and faster. In the meantime, NASA would rely on commercial companies to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station after the aging shuttle fleet is retired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday, Mr. Obama sought -- personally -- to win over his critics, offering a powerful rationale for his plan and some reasonable modifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To mitigate the impact of job losses as the shuttle program winds down, the president is now pledging to spend $40 million to promote job creation and economic development in Florida. He will also resuscitate a program to build a space capsule, but a scaled-down version to be parked at the space station for emergency escapes. That would preserve jobs in some battleground states and lay the foundation for upgrading the capsule later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has given no clue as to how much that will cost and which other NASA programs it will pillage to pay the bill. Congress must make certain that vital research programs are not harmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were concerned that the original proposal had not identified a clear goal for space travel or set deadlines for getting there. On Thursday, the president began to fill in the blanks. He called for picking a rocket design for deep space travel by 2015, allowing production to start earlier than previously planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He ruled out returning to the surface of the Moon because ''we have been there before'' and called instead for crewed missions into deeper space, starting in 2025 with a visit to an asteroid. By the mid-2030s, he expects humans will orbit Mars. We don't know how realistic these projections are since the administration has yet to put forth a thorough analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also don't know if Mr. Obama will manage to win over opponents. But Thursday's speech suggests that he has learned an important lesson from the yearlong struggle to pass health care reform. He needs to get involved early and not leave it to subordinates to defend plans that will upend vested interests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to voyages of discovery, NASA's venerable Cassini mission is about as good as it gets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In six years of cruising around the planet Saturn and its neighborhood, the Cassini spacecraft has discovered two new Saturn rings, a bunch of new moons and a whole new class of moonlets. It encountered liquid lakes on the moon Titan, water ice and a particle plume on the moon Enceladus, ridges and ripples on the rings, and cyclones at Saturn's poles. Cassini also released a European space probe that landed on Titan. And Cassini has sent back enough data to produce more than 1,400 scientific papers -- at last count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But besides the science, Cassini is state of the art in the arcane discipline of orbital mechanics -- how to get from one place to another in space to fulfill a mission's science requirements without running out of fuel. The plans are for Cassini to keep working for seven more years, but it currently has only 22 percent of the maneuvering propellant it had when it started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out how to more than double the duration of the mission with less than a quarter of the fuel is hard. Cassini's orbital mechanics present an astonishingly complex exercise in Keplerian physics and geometry. The enormous array of science objectives and targets -- moons, rings, Saturn itself -- makes it one of the most complex missions ever flown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Buffington, a Cassini mission designer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, compared the task to plotting a seven-year road trip around the United States for more than 200 scientists, all with different interests and all wanting to see different things. ''Now add the fact that you have a finite amount of time to design this road trip and need to adhere to the laws of physics, speed limits, the limited capabilities of the bus'' and the bus driver, he said. ''Oh, and the targets they want to see are moving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004 for a four-year mission, but it was so successful that NASA gave it a two-year extension, to September 2010. Then, in February, NASA extended it a second time for what it calls the Solstice mission, lasting until Saturn's northern hemisphere summer in 2017. If all goes as planned, on Sept. 15, 2017, Cassini will die a warrior's death, diving inside the rings for 22 spectacular orbits on the fringes of Saturn's atmosphere before plunging into the planet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cassini made it to its first, two-year extension in part because the science was simply too good to pass up. But another reason was that it performed so well and remained so healthy that it was left with enough unused propellant to enable it to maneuver through 64 additional orbits, after having already completed 75 in its first four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figuring out how to organize the Solstice mission took two years. Scientists presented wish lists of places they wanted to visit and things they wanted to see. The tour designers showed them a plan and told them what was possible and what was not. Then both sides did it again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The competition was fierce, but collegial,'' said Jonathan I. Lunine, a Cassini scientist and a professor of planetary science and physics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were trade-offs. Nobody got everything, but everybody got a good many things. ''We try to satisfy as many people as possible,'' said Cassini's mission planning engineer, John C.Smith of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who, with Mr. Buffington, is responsible for designing the tour. ''We have to kill at least two and sometimes three birds with one stone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the fundamental tools for adjusting the trajectory of a large manufactured object in space -- the essence of orbital mechanics -- is the gravity assist. As a spacecraft approaches a planet or moon, gravity grips it and flings it in a different direction. In the 1970s and '80s, NASA used the gravity assist technique to enable the tiny Voyager 2 to complete its ''grand tour'' of the outer planets of the solar system. Voyager 2 employed four gravity assists. The Cassini Solstice mission alone will require 56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popular analogy for the gravity assist is ''slingshot,'' but that term makes today's orbit designers grit their teeth. ''It's a lot more sophisticated than that,'' said David Seal, Cassini's mission planning supervisor. ''We can do a lot of things to get pretty much any trajectory we want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better analogy, he said, is two ice skaters in a hockey rink: a little girl and her father. The little girl is Cassini, small and fast; Dad is slow but strong. When the little girl reaches Dad at the red line, they clasp hands and Dad rotates. He can fling his daughter farther down the ice toward the far goal, toss her at right angles into the boards, send her back where she came from or let her go off at an angle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cassini's case, Dad, aptly perhaps, is Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Bigger than the planet Mercury, it is the only thing in the Saturn system, besides Saturn, with enough gravity to make radical changes in the spacecraft's trajectory every time it flies by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Without Titan,'' Mr. Seal said, ''we would go into one orbit around Saturn and be stuck there.'' Thus Titan, in the argot of orbital mechanics, is Cassini's ''tour engine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic geometry of the Saturn system is not difficult to understand. Like Earth, the polar axes of both Saturn and Titan run from north to south and are canted slightly, which gives both the planet and its largest moon ''seasons.'' A Saturn year lasts almost 30 Earth years. Cassini arrived at Saturn in the southern summer and will finish 13 years later in the northern summer. Being able to observe the change of seasons for half a Saturn year was the dominant principle in designing the Solstice mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rings of Saturn and the vast majority of its moons, including Titan, are spread out on a roughly horizontal plane from the planet's equator. Cassini needs to fly two kinds of orbits of Saturn to get the science it wants. Equatorial orbits put the spacecraft on the same plane as the moons and the rings. Using this type of orbit -- always elliptical -- Cassini can get great views of Saturn and is able to cross the orbits of several of Saturn's icy moons for close observations and imagery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equatorial orbits, however, make it impossible to see the rings, which appear as a knife edge in the middle of the planet. For ring observations, inclined orbits are a must. The spacecraft has orbited Saturn at latitudes as high as 74.7 degrees, enabling the spacecraft to look down -- or up -- at the rings, and also to observe the poles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout Cassini's lifetime the tour designers must keep a close watch on the amount of fuel that it has for navigation. This is measured as a change in spacecraft velocity in meters per second and is known in aerospace parlance as delta-V. For example, if scientists want a closer approach to the moon Enceladus, the designers might tell them the delta-V cost is 10 meters per second, and scientists and engineers will decide whether the science is worth the expenditure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Cassini began, the spacecraft had 742 meters per second delta-V available, and for the initial four-year prime mission'' and extended two-year Equinox mission, ''the cost of doing business was about 100 meters per second per year, maybe a little more,'' Mr. Seal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has left 158 meters per second delta-V for the next seven years. What makes the Solstice mission doable is that designers can trade time for fuel -- it may cost less delta-V to reach a target if the spacecraft takes longer to get there. They also use ingenuity to achieve mission objectives atlower fuel cost. And each flyby of Titan adds as much as 840 meters per second of delta-V, which is the energy used for major alterations in Cassini's trajectory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For purposes of planning, the Cassini scientists were divided into five ''disciplines'': those concerned with Saturn; with Titan; with the rings; with the icy satellites; and with the magnetosphere. Leaders of the groups, beginning in early 2008, huddled with the designers every few months to examine orbits and argue their respective causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We decided the theme of the Solstice mission was 'seasonality,' '' said Dr. Lunine, co-chairman of the Titan and icy satellites disciplines. ''Not just the ringed planet itself, but also Titan.'' With a seasonal weather cycle, ''it was very important to see what happened to Titan when summer moved from the southern hemisphere summer to northern hemisphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a lot of competition among the disciplines, and not just over target selection: ''If you're interested in the magnetosphere, you collect data over long periods of time,'' while ''Titan is short bursts,'' Dr. Lunine said. ''And within the Titan group, you have radar versus spectroscopy.'' The icy satellites group wanted a visit to a small moon, he added, ''but it didn't connect with seasonality, and we lost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time Mr. Smith and Mr. Buffington met with the discipline teams, they offered three possible tours. The next time, they offered two, and, in January 2009, the scientists picked one of them. Last July, after six months of tweaking by Mr. Smith and Mr. Buffington, the final ''reference trajectory'' was delivered. It now includes 56 passes over Titan, 155 orbits of Saturn in different inclinations, 12 flybys of Enceladus, 5 flybys of other large moons -- and final destruction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not like any problem set you get in college, because you have so many factors pulling in different directions,'' Mr. Seal said. ''The best way to measure it is to look at how much better the next iteration is than the previous one'' until ''you're only making slight improvements.'' Then you stop.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- The space shuttle Discovery returned to Earth on Tuesday with a fiery dawn plunge across the heartland of America, closing out a complex space station resupply mission with a smooth Florida landing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running a day late because of cloudy weather, Capt. Alan G. Poindexter of the Navy took over manual control at an altitude of about 50,000 feet above the spaceport, guiding the shuttle through a sweeping right overhead turn to line up on Runway 33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the shuttle's steep descent, Captain Poindexter pulled the Discovery's nose up just before the runway threshold, and the pilot, Col. James P. Dutton Jr. of the Air Force, deployed the landing gear, and the shuttle settled to a tire-smoking touchdown at 9:08 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston, Discovery, wheels stopped,'' Captain Poindexter radioed to mission control at the Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Roger, wheels stopped, Discovery. Welcome home,'' Frederick W. Sturckow, an astronaut and retired Marine colonel, replied from mission control. ''Dex, congratulations to you and the crew on an outstanding mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thanks for the words, it was a great mission,'' Captain Poindexter replied, adding, ''And we're glad the International Space Station is stocked up again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re-entry was delayed one orbit because of showers and concern about fog near the shuttle runway. But as dawn broke over the Florida spaceport, conditions improved and Bryan C. Lunney, the entry flight director, cleared the shuttle for a descent to the Kennedy Space Center, avoiding a diversion to Edwards Air Force Base in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To save fuel and avoid seasonal high-altitude ice clouds in the Northern Hemisphere, NASA prefers to bring the shuttles back to Florida on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory that carries them over the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean. But for the Discovery's flight, NASA managers approved a path from the northwest to southeast that gave the crew additional time in orbit to complete its 15-day space station resupply mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crossing the Canadian coast high above Vancouver, the Discovery plunged across the American Northwest, flying above Helena, Mont.; Casper, Wyo.; and northeast Colorado as it descended. The shuttle's computers guided the ship across central Kansas; Tulsa, Okla.; just north of Little Rock, Ark.; across central Mississippi; and Montgomery, Ala., before crossing into Florida to the Kennedy Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Captain Poindexter; Colonel Dutton; Dorothy M. Metcalf-Lindenburger, the flight engineer; Naoko Yamazaki, a Japanese astronaut; Stephanie D. Wilson, operator of the robot arm; and Richard A. Mastracchio and Clayton C. Anderson, both spacewalkers, planned to fly back to Houston early Wednesday after reunions with friends and family members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few miles from the runway, engineers were preparing the shuttle Atlantis for an overnight trip from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39A for liftoff May 14 on its final planned flight, a space station assembly mission. Rollout was delayed one day by the same weather that blocked the Discovery's return Monday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Discovery's landing, only three shuttle flights remain before the fleet is retired. The final two launchings, by the Endeavour and the Discovery, are planned for July 29 and Sept. 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the shuttle's retirement looming, NASA is racing the clock to deliver as much in the way of spare parts, supplies and science gear as possible to keep the space station operational during the gap between the end of shuttle operations and the debut of a new generation of American rockets. The Discovery's crew delivered more than 17,000 pounds of science gear and equipment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hudson River Museum is inviting young visitors to have a blast. Literally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Yonkers museum will offer model-rocket building and launching in its weekend-long celebration of National Astronomy Day (Saturday). The Lower Hudson Valley Challenger Center will provide rocket kits for older children (the recommended minimum age is 10), to be assembled in a Saturday workshop; launching is scheduled for Sunday. Children 7 to 9 can participate in another Saturday workshop for air-powered rockets; their liftoffs will happen the same day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're pretty lightweight, so they gain altitude fast and go up pretty high,'' John Huibregtse, the Challenger Center's director, said of the fuel-powered rockets (a similar model is in the photograph), which fly for 15 to 20 seconds and can reach 1,000 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huibregtse (pronounced HUGH-brex) emphasized that these launchings, powered by electrical ignition from a portable launch pad, were completely safe. The only danger? Losing the space vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can land in a tree or may end up in the Hudson River,'' he said, ''and that's something that goes along with the sport.'' Children unwilling to gamble can take their projects home. (Rocket workshops have limited space, but all are invited to watch.) On both days children can also build simple telescopes and models of planetary probes, watch star shows in the museum's planetarium and see displays like a reproduction space suit and Saturn V rocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday the artist Tom Shannon will lead his own astronomical exploration, painting with a device he invented. ''It's a pendulum with six pots of paint arranged around a central pole that's attached to the ceiling,'' he said. Switches control the flow and proportion of the pigments, which spray in a single stream as he swings the pendulum. Mr. Shannon will bring a simple version for families to try. ''It's related to orbital dynamics,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Sunday attractions include an animated film on the telescope, an audio show about space and a chance to view the Sun (safely) with a telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But will the skies cooperate? Last year rockets were launched despite a drizzle. And at least with these flights, volcanic eruptions can't interfere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Saturday and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m., 511 Warburton Avenue, Yonkers, 914-963-4550. Full schedule: hrm.org. Fuel-powered rocket building, $10; other activities free with museum admission: $5; $3 for children and 65+; free for members.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- President Obama may have hoped that a speech a week ago at the Kennedy Space Center would sway skeptics to his proposed space policy, but a Congressional hearing on Thursday gave little signs that the lines of contention have shifted yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents like Richard C. Shelby, the Republican senator from Alabama where NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has been leading the design of the Ares I rocket that the Obama administration would like to cancel, continued to denounce Mr. Obama's plans. Those plans call for ending NASA's current Constellation program that was to send astronauts back to the moon and turning to private companies for transportation into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a hearing of an appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Shelby said that the proposal would abdicate the United States' leadership in space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Future generations will learn how the Chinese, the Russians, and even the Indians took the reins of space exploration away from the United States,'' said Mr. Shelby, the ranking minority member of the commerce, justice and science subcommittee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shelby called the $6 billion that the administration would like to spend to develop commercial rockets to take people to space ''a welfare program for the commercial space industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He criticized the space agency for not researching whether a commercial market existed beyond NASA to support the companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, repeated many of the same points he had made to other Congressional committees: that NASA would ensure the safety of any and all rockets that astronauts would ride on and that the current Constellation program was unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in response to a question from Mr. Shelby about the safety of the different rocket options, General Bolden said, ''My gut tells me that Ares would be safer than anything else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear whether Congress is leaning to the views of Mr. Shelby or to those of Mr. Obama. Except for Barbara A. Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat who is chairwoman of the subcommittee, all the senators attending the hearing on Thursday represent states with businesses or NASA centers heavily involved in the current Constellation program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mikulski gave little indication of which path she might ultimately choose. ''I need to know more,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''I want to know if this is the program that the Congress and the American people are going to support from one administration to the next. We cannot reinvent NASA every four years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that the Ares I might evade the administration's ax, Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate budget committee, unveiled a version of the 2011 budget that increased NASA's 2011 budget to $19.7 billion from $19 billion in the president's budget request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The added money would pay for more launchings of prototypes of the Ares I, an idea suggested by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida. Mr. Conrad cited national security concerns that abandoning the Ares I, which uses a stretched version of the space shuttle's solid rocket booster, would drive up the cost of solid rocket motors used for ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are classified discussions we can't go into here with respect to this initiative,'' Mr. Conrad said, ''but I say to my colleagues, this is absolutely essential, for the national security, that this go forward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that proposal succeeds, then essentially all of the components of Constellation will be resurrected, albeit in less ambitious versions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his Florida speech, Mr. Obama announced that the Orion crew capsule, which was to take astronauts to the International Space Station and then the moon, would be continued as a stripped-down lifeboat for the space station. Meanwhile, other members of Congress have introduced bills to extend operations of the space shuttles beyond their planned retirement this year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DENNIS OVERBYE </div><div>903 words</div><div>24 April 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $1.5 billion seven-ton cosmic-ray experiment scheduled to be carried aloft July 29 on the space shuttleEndeavour won't be ready until August, according to the experiment's leader, Samuel Ting of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delaying the end of the 29-year-old shuttle program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials acknowledged that there would be a delay but said they had not yet decided when the final launching would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment, known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, was to be installed on the International Space Station as one last scientific errand before the final shuttle launching, of the Discovery, now scheduled for Sept. 16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, however, Dr. Ting told NASA that he would replace a key component of the spectrometer, a powerful superconducting magnet, with an ordinary magnet. The redesigned instrument would not arrive at the Kennedy Space Center until August. It would be too late for July and is not a part of the final Discovery mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have an issue,'' Dr. Ting said in a telephone interview from CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland, where the instrument was built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA officials said they had not made any decisions on a new shuttle schedule this fall, including whether to switch the last two flights so that Endeavour's flight would be the finale. ''That launch is still where it is,'' said Kyle Herring, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about a possible delay at a news conference after the recent landing of Discovery, Mike Moses, director of shuttle integration at Kennedy, said that the agency was still looking at the potential impacts to the shuttle schedule, ''but we're still looking to finish this calendar year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of extending shuttle flights past September has already been covered by Congress, which allocated $600 million to cover potential shuttle operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, in case the schedule slipped. ''So it doesn't matter if it's one flight or two flights,'' Mr. Herring added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting said the collaboration had been pondering changing magnets for at least a year and had mentioned it to NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The superconducting magnet, which produces a field 17,000 times that at the Earth's surface and allows scientists to determine the charge and momentum of particles by how their tracks bend, needs to be cooled to near absolute zero by liquid helium. But tests and calculations showed that the helium would boil away too quickly, within two or three years, leaving the seven-ton spectrometer a dead hulk. Under the Obama administration's new plan, however, the space station will stay up to 2020 or even 2028.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it's correct to go there for three years where there is a chance to do physics for 18 years,'' Dr. Ting said. ''Because there is no way to remove it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ting plans to replace the magnet with an ordinary one of the exact same size that flew in a test flight aboard the space shuttle in 1998, since it doesn't need helium cooling and thus will last as long as the station. The new magnet is only one-fifth as strong as the superconducting one, but Dr. Ting said the much longer running time of the experiment along with rearranging some of the layers of silicon that record tracks of particles would more than compensate for the weaker magnet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Sistilli, an astronomer who is NASA's program manager for the experiment, said that eliminating the need for handling supercold liquid helium would make things simpler and safer. When it warms up, liquid helium can boil explosively, as scientists at CERN found out a year and a half ago when part of the Large Hadron Collider, whose magnets are also cooled with liquid helium, exploded, delaying its operations for a year. The initial reaction at NASA, he said, was, ''Our life just got easier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last-minute switch has caused head-scratching among some physicists, who despite Dr. Ting's protestations worry that the experiment has been degraded. Gregory Tarle, a physicist at the University of Michigan, said: ''It's highly unusual for an experiment to be redesigned this close to launch. I would question the wisdom of flying something redesigned so close to launch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is only the latest adventure for an experiment that dates to the beginning of the space station era, in 1994, and has been controversial for about as long. It was originally meant to look for antimatter, but in recent years scientists have become more excited about the possibility that it could pick up signals from the mysterious dark matter that pervades the universe. Despite disagreement among scientists about the priority NASA gave to the experiment, a coalition of some 500 physicists from 16 countries, welded together by Dr. Ting's legendarily iron will, pressed ahead and put it together at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was tossed off the shuttle manifest in 2004 after the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and some prominent American physicists accused NASA of not sticking to its international commitments. Dr. Ting began making regular visits to Washington. In the fall of 2008 Congress subsequently ordered NASA to add one more shuttle flight for Dr. Ting's experiment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has always been something miraculous about transmissions from space -- those thin datastreams trickling toward Earth from research spacecraft. Over the years, the transmissions have grown more and more robust, richer in information, giving us dazzling and detailed panoramas of Saturn's moons and rings and the surface of Mars. But there has never really been anything like the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Launched in mid-February, it is shipping a torrent of data our way from its orbit above the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the Goddard Space Flight Center took the craft online, releasing the first videos and still images it shot. The quality of these images is extraordinary, 10 times the resolution of high-definition television, according to NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have seen the surface of the Sun before, but never with this clarity. Every 10 seconds, the satellite photographs the solar disk in eight different wavelengths, and what emerges -- even in these earliest images -- is both stirring and disorienting. The Sun is the most constant object in our lives, but what we see in these videos is a livid, roiling star, mottled and seething on every wavelength. It is a thing of intense, disturbing beauty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Solar Dynamics Observatory follows on the work of other important solar projects, including the Solar and Heliographic Observatory and the twin satellites of the project known as Stereo, for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, which has its own iPhone app. For the next five years and more, this new satellite will be studying the patterns of solar energy that affect life on Earth, like the solar storm that lit up the aurora borealis in the past few weeks and can disrupt navigation and communications. And, in a sense, it creates a new solar effect, which is the ability of humans to peer directly into the most familiar of stars and realize how alien it is.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- With rock music blaring, fifth graders count down from 10-9-8 to the rocket boosters' firing up, and blasting the computer-generated astronauts toward space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hey, the future looks good, huh?'' says Ken Larson, jumping to center stage at the new Exploration Space exhibition here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Larson's job is to inspire the next generation as much as he was inspired -- by his father, a reporter who befriended the first astronauts, and by his grandmother, one of the first 10 employees here at what one plaque calls ''the hot burning center of American dreams.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center is cooling, though. The space shuttles are scheduled to retire this year and instead of replacing them with new rockets for a return to the moon -- the plan under President George W. Bush -- President Obama wants NASA to focus on the long-term challenge of reaching deep space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, the United States will no longer be sending its own astronauts through the stratosphere. Instead, they will hitch rides with the Russians until around 2016, when private companies start carrying NASA astronauts and other passengers into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, if Congress goes along. Several senators, including Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, have already pledged to save the rocket program, Project Constellation, arguing it is vital for space, security and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here at the Kennedy Space Center, the celebration of the future now comes with asterisks. At the visitor's center, for example, which draws 1.5 million people every year, caveats have been forced into an extravaganza built for maximum wow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Larson's script, for instance, now includes this lawyerly line: ''We can't confirm exactly where humankind's next steps in space are going to take us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explicit references to Project Constellation have mostly been stripped out, with a few telling exceptions, like the metal sign near a trash can in the food court. And the moon has gone from a hot goal to a hypothetical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the video games at the center of Exploration Space, those who joystick their way to a safe landing hear, ''As soon as NASA starts a lunar program again, we'll send you an application.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is partly a product of unfortunate timing. Exploration Space, the most recent addition to the visitor's center, welcomed its first guests in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months later, the new Obama plan surfaced, forcing changes to Mr. Larson's script after what a spokeswoman described as ''tweaks to the messaging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Foster, a no-nonsense fifth-grade teacher from Emerald Shores, Fla., said she had hoped for more. She recalled the rush of early space flight, of the ground shaking like sand on a busy clothes dryer, while she watched from nearby as American pioneers bolted toward the heavens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Foster said she hated the idea of relying on others -- especially the Russians -- to get to the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mostly though, she worried that her students would never share her own wide-eyed experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know where we're going to get the inspiration for the children,'' Ms. Foster said in a visit last week. ''What are we going to do to get them excited to be engineers and pilots?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visitor's center tries. There is a feel of don't-you-get-it admonitions in the 3D Imax movie that includes Leonardo DiCaprio's asking, ''Will we ever find anywhere as perfect as our planet earth?''; and in the nine billboards at the entrance that tell visitors space exploration is ''a destiny, not a destination'' because ''it is the driving force of ingenuity'' that ''fuels our economy'' and ''creates the passion to pioneer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, the president told a crowd at the space center that he, too, was ''100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and its future.'' He highlighted a proposed $6 billion increase in NASA's budget over five years, and plans to save local jobs by refurbishing the center's aging infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Florida's Space Coast seems to want more ambitious goals that can be packaged into excitement. Foreigners now make up 40 percent of the visitors at the space center, and Mr. Larson said they often knew more than Americans about the benefits of space exploration, from satellites to research on antibiotics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he prepared for another countdown, and another presentation about the future, Mr. Larson added, ''The thirst for knowledge just isn't there anymore.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>750 words</div><div>11 May 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronauts will not be sent by the United States to the Moon or Mars for at least a decade, but they can still get an idea of what it would be like by living 65 feet underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, a crew of six, including two veteran astronauts, descended to Aquarius, an undersea laboratory next to a coral reef about three miles off Key Largo, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the 14th mission in a nine-year-old program known as NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations -- Neemo for short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During their two weeks in the laboratory, the aquanauts will go on simulated spacewalks, operate a crane and perform other tasks of the sort astronauts would face in setting up a habitat on another planet. ''The primary objectives are based on engineering and testing and operations design for planetary exploration,'' said William Todd, the project manager for the Neemo 14 mission. (It does not look like the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico will affect Neemo.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts of the mission seem quaintly out of date, given the current turmoil enveloping NASA's human spaceflight program. One of the mock-ups is of the S.U.V.-size Lunar Electric Rover, which may never be built because the Obama administration has proposed scuttling NASA's Constellation program to send astronauts back to the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Todd said the tasks were more important than the details of the mock-ups. For example, crew members will test procedures for transferring an injured colleague into and out of the rover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to have a lander and a rover and ways to get off those landers and ways to deal with incapacitated crewmen regardless of the destination,'' Mr. Todd said. ''We have to understand how to operate in those environments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By adjusting the buoyancy of the diving suits, the aquanauts can feel as if they are walking in the one-sixth gravity of the Moon or the three-eighths gravity of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Chris A. Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut who flew two shuttle missions, is leading Neemo 14. Crew members include Dr. Thomas H. Marshburn, who flew a shuttle mission last year; Andrew Abercromby, deputy project manager for the lunar electric rover; and Steve Chappell, a research scientist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two technicians will provide engineering support for the Aquarius lab, which is owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For half of the mission, a 20-minute lag time will affect all communications between the aquanauts and mission controllers on the surface. This would mimic the transmission delay between Earth and Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delay not only requires the crew to work more on its own but also fundamentally changes the nature of communications. Mr. Todd said that when delays were used in the last Neemo mission three years ago, NASA found that while video transmissions worked for general messages, written instructions worked best for the details, to reduce the possibility of misunderstandings. ''Those are important lessons,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Neemo aquanauts practice for what the future might look like, NASA's present will continue to unfold above. On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is scheduled to hold a hearing on the future of the human spaceflight program. The administration's plan has not garnered much visible support in Congress, but neither have many lawmakers come to the defense of Constellation. Neil A. Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, is expected to testify against the Obama proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the space shuttleAtlantis is to make its last scheduled launching from the Kennedy Space Center for a 12-day mission to the International Space Station to replace solar panel batteries, install a backup antenna and attach a Russian module filled with supplies. After the Atlantis mission, the other two shuttles -- Discovery and Endeavour -- are each to make one more flight, and then all three are to be retired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, that last flight may turn out not to be the last. The Atlantis will be prepared for another flight, to serve as a rescue vehicle if the Endeavour were to encounter problems on its last mission, and the hope of some is that, if Endeavour's flight goes well, the Atlantis could fly one last mission.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The decline of basic research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration jeopardizes the agency's ability to study and explore the cosmos, a review panel of scientists and engineers said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings could bolster the arguments of the Obama administration that NASA's current effort to send astronauts back to the Moon is too expensive and is siphoning too much money from other programs. The president's $19 billion budget for NASA in the 2011 fiscal year would cancel the Moon program, known as Constellation, and replace it with the development of technologies intended to achieve a cheaper, more sustainable approach for sending people into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report from the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded that research laboratories at the 10 NASA centers for studying materials, aeronautics and other basic science were merely ''marginally adequate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 80 percent of the laboratories are more than 40 years old, and deferred maintenance costs have swelled to $2.46 billion this year, from $1.77 billion in 2004. As a result, the report said, the agency is less able to tackle challenges encountered by its space and aeronautical missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That doesn't mean it's going to die tomorrow, but it's certainly not in strong, healthy shape,'' said Joseph B. Reagan, a co-chairman of the panel. ''I think if it kept going at the current rate, in five years the research community would not be able to support NASA's long-term goals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, NASA has one of the fastest computers in the world at its Ames Research Center in California. But officials at Ames, which is in the earthquake-prone Bay Area, have been unable to afford a $15 million uninterruptable power supply for the supercomputer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they were to lose power and lose cooling capability, they could fry that whole system, and they'd be out of business,'' said John T. Best, the committee's other co-chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aeronautics research has suffered in particular, with financing dropping by nearly half over five years, to $500 million in 2009 from $962 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Reagan said basic research made up only a small slice of NASA's budget. ''They could easily restore the balance between basic research and development activities,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report does not recommend specific financing increases for basic research. But Dr. Reagan said, ''The funding is not that large that's needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the administration's proposal, much of the Constellation money would be diverted to other areas of NASA, including those that the research council found to be underfinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the proposed cancellation of Constellation has met with skepticism and opposition from some members of Congress, who say it is too vague and too risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lester L. Lyles, a retired Air Force general who served on a blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program, echoed those sentiments last week. In a letter to Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican and one of the critics of President Obama's space plans, General Lyles worried that the president's plans swung the pendulum too far the other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes no more sense to have a NASA with an under-emphasis on human spaceflight than it did to have a NASA with an over-emphasis,'' General Lyles wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter, also signed by Raymond S. Colladay and Len Fisk, two other aerospace experts, called on NASA and Congress ''to define and develop a human spaceflight program that does not re-inflict damage on the breadth of NASA's activities and that serves the nation well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The letter writers, however, did not spell out what they thought what the answer should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who is retired from the Marine Corps, said he generally agreed with General Lyles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I appreciate what he says,'' General Bolden said Tuesday at the Langdon Education Campus in Washington, where he was talking to a class of fifth graders as part of National Lab Day. ''There is concern among a lot of people that the pendulum not swing too far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden, along with John P. Holdren, the president's science adviser, faces another turbulent day in front of Congress on Wednesday, testifying before the Senate Science, Commerce and Transportation Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also scheduled to appear at the hearing are Neil A. Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, during Apollo 11 in 1969, and Eugene A. Cernan, the last man to walk on the Moon, during Apollo 17 three years later. Last month, the two astronauts, along with James A. Lovell Jr., the commander of Apollo 13, wrote a letter that said the changes to NASA would be ''devastating.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR centuries, speculation about the existence of life elsewhere in the universe was the preserve of philosophers and theologians. Then, 50 years ago last month, the question entered the scientific sphere when a young American astronomer named Frank Drake began sweeping the skies with a radio telescope in hopes of picking up a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization. Initially, his quest was considered somewhat eccentric. But now the pendulum of scientific opinion has swung to the point where even a scientist of the stature of Stephen Hawking is speculating that aliens exist in other parts of our galaxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is predicated on the assumption, widely held today, that life would emerge readily on Earth-like planets. Given that there could be upward of a billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone, this assumption suggests that the universe should be teeming with life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the notion of life as a cosmic imperative is not backed up by hard evidence. In fact, the mechanism of life's origin remains shrouded in mystery. So how can we test the idea that the transition from nonlife to life is simple enough to happen repeatedly? The most obvious and straightforward way is to search for a second form of life on Earth. No planet is more Earth-like than Earth itself, so if the path to life is easy, then life should have started up many times over right here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Searching for alternative life on Earth might seem misconceived, because there is excellent evidence that every kind of life so far studied evolved from a common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. Yet most of the life that exists on Earth has never been properly classified. The vast majority of species are microbes, invisible to the naked eye, and scientists have analyzed only a tiny fraction of them. For all we know, there could be microbes with other ancestral origins living literally under our noses -- or even inside our noses -- constituting a sort of shadow biosphere, containing life, but not as we know it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The denizens of the hidden ''alien'' biosphere -- let's call them Life 2.0 -- might employ radically different biochemical processes than the life we know and love. Microbiologists could easily have overlooked their existence, because their methods are focused on the biochemistry of standard life. Obviously, if you go looking for A, you will find A and not B.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to go about tracking down Life 2.0 is to make educated guesses about what its biochemistry might be like. Alternative microbes might, for example, have different chemical elements. One shrewd suggestion, made by Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the United States Geological Survey, is that phosphorus -- crucial to life as we know it -- could be replaced by arsenic. She and her colleague Ron Oremland are dredging bugs from arsenic-contaminated Mono Lake in California in search of arsenic life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other researchers are focusing on the handedness of molecules. In standard life, the key amino acids are always left-handed, and the sugars are right-handed. Scientists are not sure why standard life has made this particular choice; nonliving chemical mixtures tend to contain equal amounts of both left- and right-handed molecules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If life started again, perhaps it would select different handedness for its key molecules. Should a shadow biosphere of ''mirror microbes'' exist, the organisms could be identified by culturing microbial samples in ''mirror soup'' -- a cocktail of nutrients with the handedness reversed, available from commercial suppliers. Standard life would find the soup unpalatable, but mirror life would thrive on it. Some experiments along these lines are being carried out at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, in Huntsville. Ala.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life 2.0 would be easier to identify if it inhabited distinct niches beyond the reach of regular life. Microbes are known to dwell in the superheated water around volcanic vents in the deep ocean, for example. Others survive extremes of cold, salinity, acidity or radiation. Yet all these so-called extremophiles that have been investigated to date are the same life as you and me. Regular life is clearly very hardy and adaptable, and can tolerate amazingly harsh conditions. Nevertheless, there will be limits. If Life 2.0 has a different chemical constitution, it may lurk in pockets at even more extreme temperatures or higher levels of radiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An argument often given for why Earth couldn't host another form of life is that once the life we know became established, it would have eliminated any competition through natural selection. But if another form of life were confined to its own niche, there would be little direct competition with regular life. And, in any case, natural selection doesn't always mean winner-takes-all. Some years ago it was discovered that simple microbes actually belong to two very distinct domains -- bacteria and archaea. Genetically, these groups differ from each other as much as they differ from humans. Yet they have peacefully co-existed in overlapping habitats for billions of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If my theory turns out to be correct, it will have sweeping consequences. Should we find a second form of life right here on our doorstep, we could be confident that life is a truly cosmic phenomenon. If so, there may well be sentient beings somewhere in the galaxy wondering, as do we, if they are not alone in the universe.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE crowd, all facing the same direction, waits nervously. Some fiddle with cameras on tripods while others sit in camp chairs, slapping at mosquitoes and checking their cellphones for updates. A voice comes over a loudspeaker: ''T minus 9 minutes and counting.'' After hours of excruciating anticipation, the final checks for the space shuttle launching have been made and all systems are go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents chase after small children dressed up in orange astronaut suits who can no longer contain their excitement. There is a collective gasp at T minus 2 minutes, 55 seconds, when the so-called ''beanie cap,'' or oxygen vent arm, retracts, making it appear that the shuttle is tipping its hat in farewell. T minus zero and there is a brilliant burst of billowing flame and a thunderous roar that shakes the ground and vibrates vital organs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spectators gape with unblinking eyes and dropped jaws. Awestruck, many forget to take pictures. As the shuttle climbs into the air, there are whispers of ''Oh, my God,'' along with a few incredulous profanities. As it recedes from sight, leaving behind a spiraling contrail, there are finally cheers and some tears along with hugs and slaps on the back. ''Did you see that!'' exclaimed more than one viewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A space shuttle launching is an unforgettable and intense experience, and there are just two more opportunities to feel the rush. The program will end this year after 29 years and 134 missions, so if watching a launching has been on your to-do list, start planning now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just make sure those plans are flexible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launchings are scrubbed 60 percent of the time because of weather or a technical issue -- sometimes with just minutes left in the countdown. Indeed, the final ones from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida were originally scheduled for July 29 and Sept. 16, when the Endeavor and Discovery, respectively, were to rendezvous with the International Space Station. But a recent change to an experiment planned for the Endeavor has pushed that one back to November. (The Discovery date, for now, is still on track.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to be flexible and grit your teeth if it doesn't happen when you thought it was going to happen,'' said Todd Sears, a chief financial officer for a commercial real estate company in Indianapolis. He traveled with his wife and their two children to see a shuttle launching last August, which was postponed daily for five consecutive days before it finally blasted into orbit. ''I was tempted to give up, but once I saw the shuttle on the launch pad with all the spotlights on it, I knew I had to see it go up,'' he said. ''It was absolutely worth the hassle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sears was fortunate to see it from the Kennedy Space Center Causeway, seven miles from the launching pad on the other side of the Banana River. It is the closest public viewing area and offers an excellent, unobstructed vantage. The effect is magnified by the river's reflection of the fiery rocket boosters. Tickets sell out within minutes of going on sale, typically three to six weeks before a launching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another viewing option is from the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, about the same distance from the launching pad as the causeway. Tickets are easier to come by, but with trees and power lines partly in the way, you have to wait for the shuttle to climb some distance before getting a clear view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the shock waves are just as resonant. And with the simulcast on jumbo video screens, a countdown clock and astronaut appearances, the whole thing has a campy vibe reminiscent of New Year's Eve in Times Square. A similar experience can be found at the Astronaut Hall of Fame, in Titusville, about 12 miles from the Kennedy Space Center. But the view from there is no better than a spot along the side of the road, where there is no admittance fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portions of the Beach Line Expressway, otherwise known as State Road 528, that cross the Indian and Banana Rivers offer as good a view. There are decent sightlines, too, off U.S. 1 along the Indian River and on State Road A1A along the Atlantic. Some landowners on those roadways may charge parking fees of $20 for a car and $30 for a van.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Space View Park in Titusville, less than 15 miles from the shuttle launching pad, directly across the Indian River, probably offers the best view beyond the confines of the Space Center. Shuttle spotters start arriving about 12 hours early to stake out a spot. The park turns into a patchwork of blankets and sleeping bags as people nap, play cards and picnic while they wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim McGiness, a retired chemical engineer from Midland, Mich., has witnessed two shuttle launchings, one from the causeway two years ago and another from Space View Park last month. He said he thoroughly enjoyed both. ''It's impossible to describe how tremendous and fantastic it is to see in person,'' he said. ''Television doesn't come close to capturing what it's like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. McGiness and Mr. Sears stayed at hotels in Orlando, about 44 miles from the Kennedy Space Center, during their visits. Despite the distance, Orlando may be the best bet for accommodations. Titusville, about 10 miles from space center, is a small, sleepy and, some might say, seedy town with a handful of not too luxurious motels and hotels that jack up their prices whenever there is a scheduled shuttle liftoff. And don't expect much more than fast food for dining options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cocoa Beach, 19 miles away, is where NASA engineers, astronauts and their families tend to stay. The town has a larger selection of accommodations and restaurants, but it isn't a dream destination either (read: crowded, touristy and tacky) and there, too, prices are astronomical during shuttle launchings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are options for activities if a launching is delayed. The area around the Kennedy Space Center features the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and Canaveral National Seashore. But most people who travel to see a launching are oblivious to anything other than finding a good spot to watch the liftoff and hear the sonic boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You come and camp and pray, 'Please go up, please go up,' '' said Mary Beth Ford, a mother of two from Lorida, Fla., who has seen two shuttles go up in the last two years, from Space View Park. ''And when it finally does, the ground shakes and you get goose bumps and realize nothing is impossible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU GO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tickets to view a launching from the Kennedy Space Center Causeway ($56; $46 for ages 3 to 11), the Visitor Complex ($38 and $28) and the Astronaut Hall of Fame ($17 and $13) are available by phone (866-737-5235) or at kennedyspacecenter.com three to six weeks before a launch, and they sell out quickly. You can sign up for an e-mail alert to know when they will go on sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tour operators offering viewing packages include Florida Dolphin Tours (floridadolphintours.com) and Gator Tours (gatortours.com), with prices starting at $115 for adults, and $105 for children. The package includes Kennedy Space Center Causeway tickets as well as round-trip transportation from Orlando area hotels.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey L. Bada, 67, is the distinguished professor of marine chemistry at the University of California, San Diego. He studies how life began. We spoke for an hour during the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in San Diego last winter and again this month by telephone. An edited version of the two conversations follows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE CHEMISTRY OF LIFE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. No. When I started in graduate school in 1965, I had ideas about becoming a theoretical chemist, applying quantum mechanics to chemistry. But when I arrived at U.C.S.D., I met Stanley Miller, who'd been a student of Nobel Prize-winning chemist Harold Urey. In 1953, they completed the classic experiment on the chemical origins of life. They'd taken gases present on the early Earth like methane, ammonia and hydrogen and applied a spark discharge to them, to mimic lightning. From that, they produced amino acids, the compounds that make up the proteins in all living organisms. It was a stunning discovery. So when I met Stanley, I was hooked. I switched my thesis to work with him. My Ph.D. idea was to move the spark discharge experiment a step forward by studying amino acid stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. WHY WAS STABILITY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Because, in the turbulent environment of the early Earth, if an amino acid had been too unstable it would have decomposed. There would have never been enough of it to make up what we call ''the prebiotic soup,'' the molecular ingredients of life. So I suggested this one set of reactions that might constrain their decomposition, and then, in the lab, we did an experiment, which worked the first time we tried it. We were able to show some of the conditions that would allow amino acids to exist for longer time periods. And this allowed us to understand what types of amino acids may have been present on the baby Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DO WE KNOW HOW THEY BECAME LIFE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We are closing in on that question. The Earth had to cool down enough for water to appear. Water allows molecules to dissolve and interact, which is why it is essential to life. We do know that we went from simple molecules to more complex molecules and eventually to RNA, which evolved into DNA. This took about a billion years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The missing piece of the puzzle is that intermediate phase between the amino acids and the RNA phase. We know that RNA is too complex to have arisen out of the simple molecules of the primordial soup. We can surmise that this intermediate form was able to make copies of itself to pass onto the next generation. Over time, mutations occurred and those mutants with survival advantages thrived and on and on until you eventually got to the complex RNA world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. IS THIS SAME PROCESS AT WORK SOMEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE NOW?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The chemistry we see in the lab is universal chemistry. It takes place anywhere you have the ingredients and conditions. We know that it happened, partially, on some of the meteorites that have come to earth. Amino acids have been found inside some of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. SO WE'RE PROBABLY NOT ALONE?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I don't want to say ''we'' because people immediately think of something like a human being. But life as we know it -- a self-replicating system -- is probably not unique to the Earth. Under the right conditions, with the right chemistry, it can happen. There may be simple chemistry happening on Titan, a moon of Saturn. Some people think it could be happening on the satellites of Jupiter. There are compelling reasons to think that Mars was wet when it was young and that the raw materials for life could have been there. We don't know how far it progressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DID YOU SUPPORT FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S PLAN FOR MANNED TRAVEL TO MARS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm glad the Obama administration appears to be canceling it. Until we know whether or not life existed on Mars, putting humans there is premature. We'd contaminate the planet. All we'd see is human microbes and refuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. ON THE OTHER HAND, STEPHEN HAWKING THINKS EXPOSURE TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE COULD PROVE HAZARDOUS TO EARTHLINGS. ''IF ALIENS VISIT US, THE OUTCOME WOULD BE MUCH AS WHEN COLUMBUS LANDED IN AMERICA, WHICH DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS,'' DR. HAWKING RECENTLY WARNED. IS HE ONTO SOMETHING?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Dr. Hawking suggests an intriguing possibility, although there are alternative scenarios. Aliens might bring some exotic organisms with them to Earth, but would they survive in our oxygen-rich environment long enough to do any damage to humans or the ecosystem? Meteorites from Mars have landed on Earth throughout history, and if any Martian organisms were hitchhiking on these, they have not killed us yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. THREE YEARS AGO, YOU REDID THE SPARK DISCHARGE EXPERIMENT. WHY?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Actually, we didn't redo it -- we reanalyzed it. When, in 1999, Stanley had a stroke, he donated everything in his office to my laboratory. Eight years later, I was giving a talk in Texas and someone there told me that he'd once seen the extracts of the 1953 experiment in a cardboard box in Stanley's laboratory. Stanley had kept them for all those decades! Though we were very close, he'd never told me about it. I suppose it was just old business to him. But when I got back to San Diego, I asked my staff, ''When we moved everything from Stanley's office, did we get a little cardboard box?'' And someone said, ''Yeah, its right over there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there it was! Inside, were all these tiny glass vials carefully labeled, with page numbers referring Stanley's laboratory notes. I was dumbstruck. We were looking at history. It immediately hit me that when Stanley had first done the experiment, analytic tools were still very, very primitive. We have instruments today that are a billion times better. So we then reanalyzed the original materials with the modern tools. And lo and behold, we found that the spark discharge experiment had actually made about 30 compounds. Stanley had shown they'd made only five!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DID YOUR ANALYSIS CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE EXPERIMENT? THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO STILL DOUBT IT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Oh, yes. And more! It showed how easy it was to make a huge number of compounds. What was really interesting was the Murchison meteorite, which fell to earth in 1969, was originally thought to contain maybe 75 amino acids. Three years ago, when we compared the distribution of amino acids in the discharge experiment, they were uncannily similar to those in the meteorite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would have loved to have told Stanley about this. But sadly, he was completely incapacitated by the time we found the samples. He died shortly thereafter. I would have loved to have said to him, ''Look Stanley, your experiment duplicated what happened on Murchison and you didn't know it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR OTHER SCIENTISTS TO REVISIT OLDER EXPERIMENTS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Listen, I was very fortunate to have had a mentor who had the foresight to preserve his experimental materials. Nonetheless, he couldn't anticipate all the changes that came with modern analytical chemistry. Today, we are seeing an explosion of knowledge due to new techniques. We ought to use them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was just an article in the journal PNAS about how new methods further characterized the compounds in Murchison. Up to now, we knew of hundreds in it. Yet, because of new techniques, they've found tens of thousands. And that made me think that yes, we ought to redo the spark discharge experiment. I suspect we'd also find tens of thousands of molecules that were in the prebiotic soup. That, hopefully, is the next project we'll be pursuing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA rover Opportunity is now the longest surviving spacecraft on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Thursday, 2,307 Earth days -- more than six years -- have passed since the Opportunity landed on Jan. 25, 2004. In rover local time, that is 2,246 Sols, or Martian days. That surpasses the mark of 2,245 Sols set by the Viking 1 lander, which set down on Mars on July 20, 1976, and operated until its last transmission in November 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity is currently driving to a large crater, named Endeavour, that it will not reach for two more years, if it persists that long. That would be far beyond what was hoped for when it first landed. The Opportunity, and its twin, the Spirit, were designed for a three-month mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought we'd get six months out of them,'' said Steven W. Squyres, an astronomy professor at Cornell, and the principal investigator for the rovers. ''Six years? No.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Opportunity could retroactively lose the longevity title to the Spirit, which landed three weeks earlier than the Opportunity. But the Spirit dropped out of touch March 22 when, because of the cold short days of winter, its solar panels could no longer generate enough power, and its batteries drained too far for it to keep in touch with controllers back on Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spirit had gotten stuck months earlier and was unable to drive out or even position its panels toward the Sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mission managers hope and still expect to hear from the Spirit again, perhaps as soon as September or October. The winter solstice on Mars passed on May 12, and the days on Mars are now lengthening for the rovers. The Spirit, if it revives, would continue scientific studies as a stationary station, observing weather and wobbles in the planet's rotation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the Opportunity passed Viking 1 for longevity on the surface, a couple of Mars orbiters have lasted even longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbited for more than nine years before falling quiet in 2006, and another NASA orbiter, the Mars Odyssey, which arrived on Mars in 2001 and is still orbiting and operating, is set to surpass that record later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, the Opportunity is still going, and the Spirit is hibernating</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have no idea how long they're going to last,'' Dr. Squyres said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could they outlive him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know,'' laughed Dr. Squyres, 54, ''they just might.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of amateur sky watchers has pierced the veil of secrecy surrounding the debut flight of the nation's first robotic spaceplane, finding clues that suggest the military craft is engaged in the development of spy satellites rather than space weapons, which some experts have suspected but the Pentagon strongly denies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the unmanned successor to the space shuttle blasted off from Florida on its debut mission but attracted little public notice because no one knew where it was going or what it was doing. The spaceship, known as the X-37B, was shrouded in operational secrecy, even as civilian specialists reported that it might go on mysterious errands for as long as nine months before zooming back to earth and touching down on a California runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews and statements, Pentagon leaders strongly denied that the winged plane had anything to do with space weapons, even while conceding that its ultimate goal was to aid terrestrial war fighters with a variety of ancillary missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secretive effort seeks ''no offensive capabilities,'' Gary E. Payton, under secretary of the Air Force for space programs, emphasized on Friday. ''The program supports technology risk reduction, experimentation and operational concept development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secretive flight, civilian specialists said in recent weeks, probably centers at least partly on testing powerful sensors for a new generation of spy satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the amateur sky watchers have succeeded in tracking the stealthy object for the first time and uncovering clues that could back up the surveillance theory. Ted Molczan, a team member in Toronto, said the military spacecraft was passing over the same region on the ground once every four days, a pattern he called ''a common feature of U.S. imaging reconnaissance satellites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In six sightings, the team has found that the craft orbits as far north as 40 degrees latitude, just below New York City. In theory, on a clear night, an observer in the suburbs might see the X-37B as a bright star moving across the southern sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This looks very, very good,'' Mr. Molczan said of the identification. ''We got it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In moving from as far as 40 degrees north latitude to 40 degrees south latitude, the military spacecraft passes over many global trouble spots, including Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Korea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Molczan said team members in Canada and South Africa made independent observations of the X-37B on Thursday and, as it turned out, caught an earlier glimpse of the orbiting spaceship late last month from the United States. Weeks of sky surveys paid off when the team members Kevin Fetter and Greg Roberts managed to observe the craft from Brockville, Ontario, and Cape Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Molczan said the X-37B was orbiting about 255 miles up -- standard for a space shuttle -- and circling the planet once every 90 minutes or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fair amount is known publicly about the features of the X-37B because it began life 11 years ago as a project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which operates the nation's space shuttles. The Air Force took over the program in 2006, during the Bush administration, and hung a cloak of secrecy over its budget and missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The X-37B has a wingspan of just over 14 feet and is 29 feet long. It looks something like a space shuttle, although about a quarter of the length. The craft's payload bay is the size of a pickup truck bed, suggesting that it can not only expose experiments to the void of outer space but also deploy and retrieve small satellites. The X-37B can stay aloft for as long as nine months because it deploys solar panels for power, unlike the space shuttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Weeden, a former Air Force officer now with the Secure World Foundation, a private group based in Superior, Colo., said the duration of the X-37B's initial flight would probably depend on ''how well it performs in orbit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office leads the X-37B program for what it calls the ''development and fielding of select Defense Department combat support and weapons systems.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Payton, a former astronaut and senior NASA official, has acknowledged that the spacecraft is ultimately meant to give the United States new advantages on terrestrial battlefields, but denies that it represents any kind of space weaponization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 20, two days before the mission's start, he told reporters that the spacecraft, if successful, would ''push us in the vector of being able to react to war-fighter needs more quickly.'' And, while offering no specifics, he added that its response to an ''urgent war-fighter need'' might even pre-empt the launching of other missions on expendable rockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he emphasized the spacecraft's advantages as an orbiting laboratory, saying it could expose new technology to space for a long time and then ''bring it back'' for inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mission control for the X-37B, Mr. Payton said, is located at the Air Force Space Command's Third Space Experimentation Squadron, based at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. He added that the Air Force was building another of the winged spaceships and hopes to launch it next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current mission began on April 22, when an Atlas 5 rocket at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida fired the 5.5-ton spacecraft into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks rocket launchings and space activity, said the secrecy surrounding the X-37B even extended to the whereabouts of the rocket's upper stage, which was sent into an unknown orbit around the sun. In one of his regular Internet postings, he said that appeared to be the first time the United States had put a space vehicle into a solar orbit that is ''officially secret.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., said many aerospace experts questioned whether the mission benefits of the X-37B outweighed its costs and argued that expendable rockets could achieve similar results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sure it's nice to have,'' he said. ''But is it really worth the expense?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weeden of the Secure World Foundation argued that the X-37B could prove valuable for quick reconnaissance missions. He said ground crews might rapidly reconfigure its payload -- either optical or radar -- and have it shot into space on short notice for battlefield surveillance, letting the sensors zoom in on specific conflicts beyond the reach of the nation's fleet of regular spy satellites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he questioned the current mission's secrecy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think this has anything to do with weapons,'' Mr. Weeden said. ''But because of the classification, and the refusal to talk, the door opens to all that. So, from a U.S. perspective, that's counterproductive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also questioned whether the Pentagon's secrecy about the spacecraft's orbit had any practical consequences other than keeping the public in the dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If a bunch of amateurs can find it,'' Mr. Weeden said, ''so can our adversaries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 30, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about suspicions that the Air Force's X-37B, the nation's first robotic spaceplane, is involved in the development of spy satellites rather than space weapons misspelled the surname of a former Air Force officer who said that the secrecy surrounding the current mission is counterproductive. He is Brian Weeden, not Weedon.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA has ended efforts to regain contact with its Phoenix Mars Lander near the planet's north pole. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said Monday that efforts to contact the lander were unsuccessful, and an image taken by a spacecraft suggested ice damage to its solar panels.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Gliding into retirement after 32 missions covering 120 million miles, the shuttle Atlantis dropped out of orbit and returned to Earth on Wednesday, wrapping up a 25-year career with a near-flawless space station assembly mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking over manual control 50,000 feet above the Florida spaceport, Capt. Kenneth T. Ham of the Navy, the commander, guided the 105-ton space plane through a sweeping right overhead turn before a steep descent to Runway 33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just shy of the runway threshold, Captain Ham pulled the shuttle's nose up, Cmdr. Dominic A. Antonelli of the Navy, the pilot, deployed the ship's landing gear and Atlantis swooped to a picture-perfect touchdown at 8:48 a.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houston, Atlantis, we have wheels stopped,'' Captain Ham radioed a few moments later as the shuttle coasted to a stop on the runway centerline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sure the station crew members hated to see you leave, but we're glad to have you back,'' Col. Charles O. Hobaugh of the Marines replied from mission control in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronauts, including Captain Ham; Commander Antonelli; Michael T. Good, a flight engineer and retired Air Force colonel; Garrett E. Reisman; Piers J. Sellers; and Capt. Stephen G. Bowen of the Navy, doffed their pressure suits and joined NASA managers and engineers on the runway for a walk-around inspection before returning to the crew quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She looks great,'' Commander Antonelli said of the Atlantis. ''From the condition we brought her back in, she is so ready to get stacked and back out to the launch pad. You can tell that's where she wants to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a busy week docked to the International Space Station, the astronauts installed a Russian research module, delivered several tons of supplies and carried out three spacewalks to install a backup Ku-band antenna, an equipment mounting platform and six new solar array batteries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the final planned mission for Atlantis as NASA phases out the shuttle program after three decades and more than 130 flights. Only two more missions are planned, a flight by Discovery in September or October and a final flight by Endeavour late this year or early next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Atlantis will be processed for launch on a possible rescue mission in case of any major problems that might prevent Endeavour's crew from making a safe re-entry. And while there are no official plans to actually launch Atlantis, NASA managers are seeking permission from the Obama administration to send the shuttle back up on one final mission to resupply the space station. A decision is expected later this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis blasted off on its first flight, a classified military mission, on Oct. 3, 1985. Among the highlights of its quarter-century of service were the launchings of robotic probes to Venus and Jupiter, the deployment of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite, five military missions and seven flights to the Russian Mir space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlantis also flew 11 missions to the International Space Station and visited the Hubble Space Telescope last year for a final overhaul.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>533 words</div><div>27 May 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was buffeted with more criticism and skepticism before Congress on Wednesday as he sought to defend the Obama administration's proposal to revamp the space agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, the Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology, said Congress had still not been told enough to make informed decisions about the president's plan to cancel the space agency's Constellation program that would send astronauts back to the moon and turn, instead, to private companies for transportation into orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So far we have not seen any hard analysis from the administration that would give us confidence that it can be done for the amount budgeted,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In President Obama's budget request for the 2011 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, he called the Constellation program too expensive. The spending request added $6 billion over five years to NASA's budget, but the increase was directed to other areas of NASA like aeronautics research, climate research and robotic science missions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech last month, Mr. Obama described ambitious goals for NASA: to send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025 and then to Mars a decade later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gordon noted that the administration's budget projections for what would be spent through 2025 on human spaceflight were far below what a blue-ribbon panel said last year was necessary for any program sending astronauts beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does no good to cancel a program that the administration characterizes as 'unexecutable' if that program is simply replaced with a new plan that can't be executed either,'' Mr. Gordon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional turmoil surrounded the Constellation program on Wednesday when its program manager, Jeffrey M. Hanley, was removed. In an e-mail message to his team, he said NASA headquarters had told him his services ''are no longer required, effective immediately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deputy program manager, Dale Thomas, was named acting program manager, and Mr. Hanley's new position is as associate director for strategic capabilities at NASA's Johnson Space Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the hearing, Representative Gabrielle Giffords, Democrat of Arizona, said the reassignment of Mr. Hanley made her ''personally very dubious'' of the pledge by NASA's head, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., that the agency would diligently continue work on Constellation until Congress approves any changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his April speech, Mr. Obama tried to assuage criticism that he was not interested in human spaceflight by announcing the continued development of the Constellation program's Orion crew capsule. It was to take astronauts to the moon, but is now envisioned as a lifeboat for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Bolden said at the hearing that the Orion lifeboat would cost $4.5 billion over five years to develop, not including the cost of launching it to the space station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NASA spokeswoman said later that none of the financing for the Orion lifeboat would come from the $6 billion allocated to the commercial crew program, and that the offsetting funds would come from elsewhere in the human spaceflight program.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The space shuttleAtlantis dropped out of orbit and returned to Earth to complete its 32nd and final mission, a successful trip to the space station to deliver supplies and install equipment and a research module.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Atlantis, in service for 25 years, is the first orbiter to reach its final scheduled flight as NASA phases out its three-shuttle fleet. It will eventually go to a museum, but not quite yet. First, it will be readied for emergency launch in case of trouble during Endeavour's last mission, late this year or early in 2011; Discovery makes its final flight in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS In the space of 24 hours, three widely followed and critically acclaimed TV drama series -- ''Lost,'' ''24'' and the original ''Law &amp;Order'' -- broadcast their last episodes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS For ''Lost'' and ''24,'' the final shows were planned to bring their running plot threads to a conclusion, though fans of the enigmatic ''Lost'' were divided on whether it was a satisfying one. The episodic ''Law &amp;Order,'' above, had already completed its last show of the season before NBC decided not to renew it, but it, too, ended with some closure: good medical news for a major character fighting cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS Lori Berenson, the New Yorker imprisoned in Peru after being convicted of collaborating with a Marxist rebel group in a foiled terrorist plot, was released on parole after serving 14 years of her 20-year sentence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS A judge said that Ms. Berenson, who married a former rebel in 2003 and bore a son in 2009 while imprisoned, would have to remain in Peru while on parole. Ms. Berenson dropped out of M.I.T. and traveled to Latin America as a left-wing activist; a tribunal said she rented a house in Lima for rebels to use, and aided a failed plot to take the Peruvian Congress hostage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS Two major musical acts, U2 and Christina Aguilera, abruptly postponed summer concert tours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Both tours were to be promoted by <span class="companylink">Live Nation</span>, the live-event juggernaut that controls many large venues and tours and that merged with <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span> earlier this year. U2's lead singer recently had back surgery and Ms. Aguilera cited time pressure from acting in a movie, but many in the industry speculated that soft ticket demand might have played a role. The Eagles have also scrapped some tour dates and other acts are reportedly having weak advance sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The House of Representatives voted to let the Defense Department lift the ban on gay and bisexual people's serving openly in the military, a big step toward dismantling the policy widely known as ''don't ask, don't tell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS The Senate Armed Services Committee also endorsed the measure, and its chairman, Carl Levin of Michigan, said he thought the full Senate would back it, because it allows the Pentagon to lift the ban carefully after studying the ramifications. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, support ending the ban.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A black hole rolls toward New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the Large Hadron Collider finally done its worst?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not by a long shot. This particular embodiment of cosmic hunger, in which space closes in on itself and time dies, heralds not the end of the world but only the beginning of the World Science Festival, the annual New York mash-up of science, art and culture. This black hole is the central menace in ''Icarus at the Edge of Time,'' a new musical work by Philip Glass based on a story by Brian Greene, the Columbia University physicist and festival co-founder. The world premiere of ''Icarus,'' complete with 62-pieces from the Orchestra of St. Luke's, images from the London artists Al and Al, and John Lithgow narrating, will anchor a gala celebrating science on Wednesday night at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yo-Yo Ma, among others, will be performing, but the star of the star-lovers will be Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge University cosmologist who has done more than anyone else to explore, at least metaphorically, the nature of black holes. ''Hawking so fully embodies what the festival is all about -- courageous exploration of the unknown,'' Dr. Greene said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The festival runs through Sunday with 40 events in about 20 locations around Manhattan and -- new this year -- Brooklyn. It begins on Tuesday morning with the unveiling in Battery Park of a full-scale model of NASA's 80-foot-long James Webb Space Telescope, designed to be launched in 2014 to prowl the early years of the universe; it will be in place all week. Subsequent events include dance performances, panel discussions about the nature of reality and about animal intelligence, and group star-gazing along the Hudson River. One event sure to resonate because of recent headlines from the Gulf of Mexico features Fabien Cousteau, grandson of Jacques Cousteau, and the marine biologist Sylvia Earle, explorer in residence at the National Geographic Society, discussing the past and future of ocean exploration. Others will explore inner space. In ''Strangers in the Mirror,'' for example, Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and author who is pretty much a walking, talking science festival unto himself, and the painter Chuck Close, famous for his large-scale portraits, discuss their common malady -- an inability to recognize faces, including their own in a mirror.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The festival culminates in a daylong science street fair in Washington Square Park on Sunday and a repeat of ''Icarus'' in the Skirball Center at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third annual World Science Festival, which was founded by Dr. Greene and his wife, Tracy Day, a former television producer, to reunite ''those long-lost lovers,'' science and art, in the words of Alan Alda, the actor and science buff who is their close co-conspirator. Already, however, the routine seems part of the fabric of the civic cosmos: bright red chairs, professional media-savvy moderators to stir the talk and steer it over rough spots, generous helpings of jazzy graphics and music, and long lines out the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed by what it refers to as its ''founding benefactors'' -- the Simons Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation -- the festival has an annual budget of about $5 million, Dr. Greene said. This year the <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman Corporation</span>, the prime contractor for the Webb telescope, is a principal sponsor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the presence of Dr. Hawking suggests, this year's festival has a decidedly cosmic flavor. The Webb telescope model will preside over a star-gazing party hosted by, among others, John Grunsfeld, the former NASA astronaut and Hubble Space Telescope repairman, on Friday night. Telescopes will be available, or you can bring your own. Meanwhile throughout the week visitors to the Broad Street Ballroom in Lower Manhattan can hear what black holes might sound like as they are being formed. Astronomers hope to record them with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, a vast expanse of lasers and mirrors set up in Washington State and Louisiana to measure the twitching and pulsing of space-time in response to cosmic catastrophes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And of course there is the new cosmic ''Icarus.'' Dr. Greene said that the impetus for the updated version of the story, about a young man who flies too close to the Sun and so plummets to his death, came from his children's love of adventure stories, and his own feelings as a child about the fate of the original Icarus. ''To pay with your life for going against what you're told to do -- never liked it,'' he said in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new version the young Icarus is trapped on a spaceship in the middle of a multigenerational trip to another star. When the ship has to detour around an uncharted black hole, Icarus, a genius pilot and navigator, decides to go take a close look at it. He has carefully plotted a trajectory to avoid falling into the hole, but has neglected to take into account an important effect of gravity on time: a watch appears to move more slowly inside a strong gravitational field than outside it. Icarus avoids falling into the black hole, but when he runs thousands of years have gone by in what to him were a few minutes. The spaceship, with his father and everything else he ever knew, is long gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Green originally envisioned his reimagining of the Icarus myth as a performance piece a la ''Peter and the Wolf,'' but ended up turning it into a book, which was published by Knopf in 2008 with Hubble photos. Now it has been reworked with a score by Mr. Glass, script by Dr. Green and the playwright David Henry Hwang, and visuals by Al and Al, the artists and filmmakers Al Holmes and Al <span class="companylink">Taylor of London</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was commissioned and co-produced by the World Science Festival and the Southbank Center in London, where it will be performed later this year as part of the 350th anniversary of the Royal Society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several festival programs will be streamed online. Ms. Day said that this was a way for the festival to reach across the nation and the world without becoming larger or more expensive. ''We don't want to expand our footprint,'' she said. ''We're big enough.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two striking features on the Northern ice caps of Mars: a series of troughs that spiral outward from the center of the ice cap, creating the image of a pinwheel, and a canyon larger than the Grand Canyon. Since they were discovered in 1972, they have intrigued scientists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prevailing theory was that both features were formed through a process of erosion, after the ice caps were formed. In the case of the canyon, known as the Chasma Boreale, many believed it was created during a huge meltdown, like a subsurface volcanic eruption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scientists have new evidence that both the canyon and the troughs were formed while the ice caps themselves were forming, not afterward. Their results are published in a pair of papers in the May 27 issue of Nature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous guesses were made using images taken of Mars's surface, but the new research uses images from orbiting radars that penetrate beneath the surface of the formations. Using these images, scientists determined that wind patterns shaped the way ice accumulated on the caps, creating the spirals and the canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the scientists hope to use the data to model climate patterns in Mars over time. This is one step in understanding an ancient mystery -- whether there is life on Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're going to look for life on Mars, then we need to understand where the water is, where it was, and what the temperatures have been,'' said Jack Holt, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, and an author on both papers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEAR KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- A train pulling the last set of space shuttle solid-fuel booster segments reached the Kennedy Space Center last Thursday -- a day after the shuttle Atlantis completed its final planned mission -- in a reminder that the program is nearing the end of the line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember when we heard about the last solid rocket booster test firing, the last main engine test firing, the last tank manufacturing and now the last set of boosters coming to K.S.C.,'' said the shuttle's launch director, Michael D. Leinbach. ''Yeah, this has been 25 years of my life. It's very, very touching, a lot of emotions kick in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach and about two dozen managers and engineers with NASA and <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems</span>, which builds the huge shuttle boosters near Promontory, Utah, accompanied the segments for the final 120 miles of their cross-country journey, sharing memories tinged with pride and sadness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Melancholy kicks in, a little bit of denial, probably,'' Mr. Leinbach said as the train rolled south from Jacksonville, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expressed concern about looming layoffs -- some 7,000 shuttle jobs are being eliminated at the space center alone -- and said, ''The thing that makes me most angry, and maybe 'disappointed' is a better word than 'angry,' is the fact that America's not going to be able to launch American astronauts on American rockets for many, many years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leinbach was referring to the gap between the end of shuttle operations after two final flights and the debut of commercially developed rockets and capsules that are at the heart of the Obama administration's new space policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While supporters of the new plan believe private-sector rockets can be ready in three or four years, many agency insiders believe that such assessments are overly optimistic and that technical problems will inevitably delay whatever comes next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, NASA astronauts will be forced to hitch rides on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, at more than $50 million a seat, to reach the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is preparing the shuttle Discovery for launch in September or October to deliver supplies and spare parts to the space station. Endeavour is to go on the final mission late this year or early next to deliver a $1.5 billion physics experiment to the lab complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six booster segments delivered last week, along with two that arrived earlier, will be prepared for launch with Atlantis for an emergency rescue mission were Endeavour's crew to run into a problem preventing safe re-entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA managers and supporters in Congress are lobbying the Obama administration to launch Atlantis on a final space station resupply mission next summer if a rescue flight is not needed. By launching Atlantis with a reduced crew of four, a backup shuttle would not be needed. The astronauts could instead seek safe haven on the space station until returning aboard Soyuz spacecraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it makes sense,'' said Michael J. Massimino, a veteran astronaut. ''You've got to weigh it against the costs. So let the cost guys figure it out. But when they do, I think they'll see that it's worth it for us to fly it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here was a model for the next great time machine, just over John Grunsfeld's shoulder in a field in Battery Park: a giant telescope that will be launched in 2014 and sent one million miles from Earth. By looking deep into space, it will collect light and images that have been traveling since nearly the beginning of the universe, and send them back here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Grunsfeld, trim and compact at 51, has floated in space for hours at a time, miles above the Earth, fixing the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, the mirrors on the Hubble were not working properly, and it was thought to be the world's highest and most expensive lemon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, when Dr. Grunsfeld and his colleagues finished their repairs, it was able to take pictures from billions of years ago. Scientific theories about the dawn of the universe and early galaxies had to give way to actual data from the Hubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be 80 feet long, 37 feet wide and 40 feet high. The designers say it will be powerful enough to reveal the details on a penny at a distance of 24 miles. Light from the moon takes less than two seconds to reach Earth, 8.5 minutes from the sun and 55,000 years from close galaxies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of looking at toddler pictures of the universe, we will be able to look at baby pictures,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''The Hubble has seen back 13 billion years, into galaxies 600 or 700 million years after the Big Bang. Hopefully, the Webb will get us back to 200 million years after the Bang.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Webb model will be on view in Battery Park until Sunday, as part of the city's World Science Festival. Other than throwing ticker-tape parades for astronauts and graduating smart kids from schools that specialize in science, the city rarely has much direct contact with the American space program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday night, Dr. Grunsfeld, who retired as NASA's chief scientist at the beginning of the year, and other astronomers will set up 100 telescopes in Battery Park for star gazing. ''Saturn should be up'' then, he said. ''Saturn is a huge favorite of mine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its current state, the Webb model is not an especially graceful-looking structure, and it is hard to imagine how it will be able to travel a million miles. The bottom of it consists of a sun shade, an umbrella about the size of a tennis court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The umbrella will be closed up until it's finished traveling,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Then it will open up like origami.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of the sun shield is to keep the telescope cool; it will operate at 40 degrees Kelvin, or nearly minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Grunsfeld said. By way of comparison to suntan lotion, the umbrella will provide a sun protection factor of 1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the instruments together will use about the same amount of electricity as a hair dryer, and that will come from solar power,'' said Blake Bullock, a manager at <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span>, the principal contractor building the telescope for NASA. ''Once it is out there, you will have these photons that have been traveling for 12 billion years without hitting anything until they run into'' the Webb telescope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars formed out of helium and hydrogen; nuclear fusion got turned on and created carbon and other elements; many explosions later, organic chemistry, life and humans came along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have zinc in our vitamins,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''Why zinc? It comes from the supernova explosions. To account for what we're made of, you have to have three supernova explosions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE power of the telescope is that it can answer the deepest questions about how things came to be. ''We don't know why the Big Bang happened,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said. ''In my job, I think about what happened right after that. But look at this: furry mammals on Earth can build a telescope that can look back to the beginning of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of hundred students gathered to look at the Webb model on Tuesday morning. Brian Greene, a physicist and author who is one of the organizers of the festival, asked those in the audience how many of them believed that there was life out there, beyond the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good majority of the crowd, students, teachers, scientists, raised their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Dr. Grunsfeld stood. How many, he wanted to know, believed that aliens from out there were walking the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, only a few raised their hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there are aliens, they'll be here in New York,'' Dr. Grunsfeld said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 6, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The About New York column on Wednesday about the display at Battery Park of a model of a new space telescope misstated the age of John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut. He is 51, not 52. The article also misstated the amount of time it takes light from the moon to reach Earth. It is less than two seconds, not four seconds.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- As the nation held its collective breath, China's first astronaut, Yang Liwei, floated back to the motherland, having orbited Earth 14 times in the Shenzhou 5, or Divine Capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was October 2003, and the national broadcaster CCTV carried live coverage of the momentous event, from Mr. Yang's famous pleasantries uttered in space -- ''I feel good'' -- to the instant that workers opened the capsule door to reveal the pale but smiling face of a hero, offering irrefutable evidence that China's maiden manned space voyage had gone off without a hitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or had it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a lecture he gave to a group of journalism students last month, a top official at Xinhua, the state news agency, said that the mission was not so picture-perfect. The official, Xia Lin, described how a design flaw had exposed the astronaut to excessive G-force pressure during re-entry, splitting his lip and drenching his face in blood. Startled but undaunted by Mr. Yang's appearance, the workers quickly mopped up the blood, strapped him back in his seat and shut the door. Then, with the cameras rolling, the cabin door swung open again, revealing an unblemished moment of triumph for all the world to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The content of Mr. Xia's speech, transcribed and posted online by someone who attended the May 15 lecture at Tianjin Foreign Studies University, has become something of a sensation in recent days, providing the Chinese a rare insight into how their news is stage-managed for mass consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Titled ''Understanding Journalistic Protocols for Covering Breaking News,'' the speech was intended to help budding journalists understand Xinhua's dual mission: to give Chinese leaders a fast and accurate picture of current events and to deftly manipulate that picture for the public to ensure social harmony, and by extension, the Communist Party's hold on power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at Xinhua and Tianjin Foreign Studies University did not return calls seeking comment, making it impossible to confirm details of the talk, but many of the points Mr. Xia made are borne out in Xinhua's coverage of the events he discussed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it does not mention the staging of the landing for the cameras, Mr. Yang's autobiography, published this year, describes the injuries he suffered during the flight, including the cut to his lip caused by a microphone. He also says that the pressure from the infrasound resonance during takeoff was excruciating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of my organs seemed to break into pieces,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Xia's journalism lecture, accompanied by a PowerPoint demonstration, included other examples of Xinhua's handiwork, most notably coverage of ethnic rioting in the far west of China last summer that left nearly 200 people dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the transcript, Mr. Xia explained how Xinhua concealed the true horror of the unrest, during which the victims were mostly Han Chinese, for fear that it would set off violence beyond Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region. Uighur rioters burned bus passengers alive, he told the class, and they raped women and decapitated children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Under those circumstances, it would have exacerbated ethnic conflicts if more photos were released,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Xinhua also has another purpose -- intelligence gathering -- and two days later the agency's reporters sprang into action, leaving a government-organized media tour to sneak into a hospital to photograph the bodies of those slain during a wave of bloodletting by Han Chinese after the initial burst of unrest. Those deaths, he told the class, were reported to Beijing but did not make it into official news reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was after receiving such unadulterated ''internal reference news,'' he said, that President Hu Jintao flew home early from a meeting to deal with the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who often lays bare details of elements of Beijing's propaganda machine on the Web site China Digital Times, said the seeming frankness of Mr. Xia's words reflected how unapologetic Xinhua was in its mission and its methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's basically telling these students that journalism in China is a big show, it's fabricated, but in the end it's all justified for the higher purpose of stability,'' Mr. Xiao said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice of massaging the message has become more nuanced since the days when disfavored leaders were airbrushed out of group photos or details of a disaster -- like the extent of the damage caused by the 1976 earthquake in Tangshan that claimed a quarter-million lives -- could simply be kept from the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Xinhua and the Communist Party's propaganda department to which it reports have become far more sophisticated, but the challenges they face have also become more daunting in the Internet age. Although government censors still require China's main news portals to carry Xinhua dispatches on delicate matters like street protests or official corruption, censorship is de facto far less comprehensive online than in traditional media.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postings about Mr. Xia's journalism lecture were quickly deleted, for instance, but new transcripts kept appearing. By late Thursday, at least 50 accounts came up in a <span class="companylink">Google</span> search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Xiao, the fact that the original posting had appeared at all was encouraging and suggested that some Chinese journalism students were still idealistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Perhaps it shows that at least one of these young students was shocked by what he heard,'' he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>886 words</div><div>5 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first flight of a privately developed rocket that may eventually carry NASA astronauts to space took off Friday afternoon and reached orbit in what appeared to be a nearly flawless trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> for short, launched the 154-foot, 735,000-pound Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, heading east over the Atlantic. The nine first-stage engines ignited at 2:45 p.m. and burned for three minutes before dropping into the ocean while the second-stage engines burned about six minutes to place a dummy payload capsule almost perfectly into the target orbit 155 miles above the Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We achieved 100 percent of our objectives on the mission,'' said Elon Musk, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s founder and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launching was pushed back almost four hours after the countdown hit a few snags, including a delay to fix a problem in the rocket's self-destruct system and a last-minute abort, at 1:30 p.m., because of an engine reading outside the acceptable range. <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> engineers reset the systems and resumed the countdown before the launching window closed at 3 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success was a major boon to those supporting President Obama's proposal to turn the launching of astronauts over to private companies. A spectacular failure would have provided ammunition to opponents who call Mr. Obama's approach too risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to overstate how impressive it is to do so much on the first flight, given the historic track record of new rockets,'' said John Gedmark, executive director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, who opposes the president's space plans, was not swayed. ''Make no mistake,'' she said in a statement, ''even this modest success is more than a year behind schedule, and the project deadlines of other private space companies continue to slip as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''This test does not change the fact that commercial space programs are not ready to close the gap in human spaceflight,'' with the space shuttles scheduled to be retired after two more flights and Mr. Obama proposing the cancellation of NASA's follow-on rocket program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzanne M. Kosmas, a Democratic congresswoman whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center and who has also been skeptical of the proposed NASA changes, issued a more complimentary statement: ''The successful test launch of <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>'s Falcon 9 rocket,'' she said, ''is a significant step in the development of the commercial space industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Kosmas argued that commercial rockets should be a complement to a NASA-led program, not a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debate on the future of NASA's human spaceflight program will continue through the summer as the administration and Congress try to arrive at a compromise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> has tried to play down the significance of the first Falcon 9 launching. ''I hope people don't put too much emphasis on our success,'' Mr. Musk said Thursday at a news conference, ''because it's simply not correct to have the fate of commercial launch depend on what happens in the next few days. But it certainly does add to the pressure. There's more weight on our shoulders because of that. I wish there weren't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the flight, Mr. Musk said it was ''to a significant degree a vindication of what the president has proposed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> is aiming to launch a second Falcon 9 this summer to demonstrate its capabilities for NASA before it gets the go-ahead to take cargo and supplies to the International Space Station. That flight will include an operational version of the Dragon capsule, which will hold cargo and, eventually, astronauts. That capsule would not go to the space station but would demonstrate orbital maneuvers and return to Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third Falcon 9 flight has been pushed back about five months to March 2011 at the earliest. However, Mr. Musk said he would like to expand its objectives so that the Dragon capsule could go all the way to the space station, perhaps even carrying cargo. That objective had been scheduled for the fourth flight.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> factory here, the full-size space station mockups sitting on the warehouse floor look somewhat like puffy white watermelons. The interiors offer a hint of what spacious living in space might look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every astronaut we have come in here just says, 'Wow,' " Robert T. Bigelow, the company founder, told Kenneth Chang of The New York Times. "They can't believe the size of this thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years from now, the company plans for real modules to be launched and assembled into the solar system's first private space station. Paying customers - primarily nations that do not have the money or expertise to build a space program from scratch - would arrive a year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2016, a second, larger station would follow. The two Bigelow stations would then be home to 36 people at a time - six times as many as currently live on the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this business plan unfolds as it is written - the company has two fully inflated test modules in orbit already - Bigelow will be buying 15 to 20 rocket launchings in 2017 and in each year after, providing ample business for the private companies that the Obama administration would like to finance for the transportation of astronauts into orbit - the so-called commercial crew initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama's budget proposal for 2011 calls for investing $6 billion over five years for probably two or more companies to develop spacecraft capable of carrying people into space. Then, instead of operating its own systems, like the space shuttles, NASA would buy rides for its astronauts on these commercial space taxis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This represents the entrance of the entrepreneurial mind-set into a field that is poised for rapid growth and new jobs," Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in February. "And NASA will be driving competition, opening new markets and access to space and catalyzing the potential of American industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials have been careful not to say their commercial crew plan relies on a market beyond NASA, but for now, Bigelow appears to be the only non-NASA buyer for commercial crew services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody," Mr. Bigelow said of competition he sees on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, the rosier promises of the president's plan rest on this enigmatic, 100-employee company located on 50 acres of desert not far from the casinos and strip clubs and the ability of Mr. Bigelow, an iconoclast who made his fortune in real estate including the Budget Suites of America hotel chain, to get his dreams off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has spent about $180 million of his own money so far and has said he is willing to spend up to $320 million more. An expansion of the factory will double the amount of floor space as the company begins the transition from research and development to production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow only occasionally gives interviews, and except for Michael N. Gold, the director of Bigelow's Washington office, the employees almost never speak publicly. A company document titled "Some Important <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> Cultural Values" implores employees, "Keep your work and the work of your co-workers very private from people outside the company." (Mr. Gold said that the confidentiality stems from federal regulations designed to protect technological information and that the engineers are busy working.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Las Vegas site is hemmed by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soundness of the business case is unknown to outsiders. Mr. Bigelow declines to say if he has firm commitments from any countries or companies to rent space on his space stations. In recent years, he has played down the notion that he is building a space hotel for rich tourists, although he says space tourism could provide a part of his business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, Mr. Gold visited countries like Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, England and Sweden to gauge interest. A stay on a Bigelow station, including transportation, is currently priced at just under $25 million a person for 30 days. That is less than half the more than $50 million a seat that NASA is paying for rides alone on Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station. Doubling the stay to 60 days adds just $3.75 million more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a country or company willing to sign up for a four-year commitment, the lease for an entire six-person module would cost just under $395 million a year, and that would include transportation for a dozen people each year. "You see why this is attractive for the sovereign client market," Mr. Gold said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bigelow prices are good through 2018, and Mr. Bigelow said the prices would drop by then if, as he expects, rocket prices drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're very comfortable with our numbers," he said, although he declined to discuss the details. <span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies Corporation</span>, or <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, which is the most optimistic in reducing launching costs, estimates that rides to space on its Falcon 9 rockets would be $20 million a seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to trust a little bit that we're making these investments because we think it's going to make sense economically at the end of the day," Mr. Bigelow said. "We won't execute our business plan if those numbers aren't there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His space stations are not his only interest in space. "I've been a researcher and student of U.F.O.'s for many, many years," Mr. Bigelow said. "Anybody that does research, if people bother to do quality research, come away absolutely convinced. You don't have to have personal encounters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "People have been killed. People have been hurt. It's more than observational kind of data."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other views that run counter to mainstream science include a belief in the power of prayer and a disbelief in the Big Bang theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea of inflatable spacecraft dates back almost to the beginning of the space age, solving a stubborn conundrum with putting stuff in space. Rockets are tall, but not particularly wide. With inflatable spacecraft, the structure can be packed tightly into the payload and then filled with air once in orbit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's Echo I and Echo II satellites, launched in 1960 and 1964, were large Mylar balloons. NASA commissioned Goodyear to build prototypes of an inflatable space station, which looked like a big rubber inner tube.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rubber space stations never flew, in part because of an obvious design weakness - they could pop if hit by meteoroids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea remained dormant until the 1990s, when NASA started exploring how to build living quarters for a human mission to Mars. William C. Schneider, then the senior engineer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, returned to the inflatable design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of rubber like the 1960s Goodyear design, Dr. Schneider used an airtight bladder surrounded by Kevlar straps. "It dumps its pressure load into the straps," Dr. Schneider said. "Those two together make a very efficient design."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the straps, alternating layers of aluminized fabric and foam absorb and disperse the impacts of micrometeoroids, providing better protection than metal structures, Dr. Schneider said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though he was sure the design was sound, he built two prototypes of the TransHab module and demonstrated their resilience in a swimming pool and a vacuum chamber. "People would think of it as a balloon," said Dr. Schneider, who now is a visiting professor at Texas A&amp;M University. "In cases, it was six times as good as needed. It's absolutely verified."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the Mars plans were shelved as too expensive, and TransHab was reimagined as a crew quarters module for the International Space Station. Then the space station costs grew, and in 2000, Congress prohibited NASA from spending any more money on TransHab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow, 66, said that he was inspired by NASA's successes of the 1960s, culminating with the Moon landings, and that he always hoped to invest in space someday. He read about TransHab in 1998, and learning of the project's imminent demise, he established <span class="companylink">Bigelow Aerospace</span> in 1999 and bought an exclusive license to the NASA patents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Schneider joined Bigelow as a consultant. The Bigelow designs are essentially very close to his NASA work, Dr. Schneider said, with some changes like replacing the Kevlar with Vectran, another bullet-resistant fabric. There are also some notable improvements like the addition of small windows, already tested on the Genesis I and II test modules that were successfully launched from Russia using converted ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He had great manufacturing capability," Dr. Schneider said. "They have some real good engineers as well. I'm sure they will be very successful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest hole in his plans, Mr. Bigelow said, is the one not entirely in his control: getting to and from the space stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while, Bigelow and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> were collaborating on a small capsule that would launch on an Atlas V rocket, which currently launches Air Force satellites and other payloads. <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> won the NASA contract for building the Orion crew capsule for NASA's Constellation program and dropped out of the work with Bigelow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mimicking the $10 million X Prize that spurred the development of the suborbital spaceplane SpaceShipOne, Mr. Bigelow offered $50 million to anyone who could build an orbital spacecraft. No one tried to claim the prize before it expired in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigelow is collaborating with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> using $18 million that NASA has provided for preliminary design of a commercial crew capsule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Reiley, the program manager at <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> for the capsule, said he was not very familiar with Bigelow's space station plans, but was impressed with what Bigelow has contributed to <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s capsule. "They're a lot more entrepreneurial than we are," Mr. Reiley said, "and it's refreshing for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> spacecraft is ready by 2014, that is when the dance of Bigelow space station modules will begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A habitat called Sundancer, with an inflated volume of about 6,400 cubic feet, would launch first. A separate rocket would then carry two Bigelow astronauts to take up residence in Sundancer as additional pieces - a second Sundancer, a larger habitat of about 11,700 cubic feet, and a central connecting node - are launched. The modules are to dock by themselves with the astronauts present to fix any glitches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the stations are up, Bigelow still needs to demonstrate that it can juggle the logistics of supplying food, water and air, as well as fix the inevitable glitches that will arise. Mr. Bigelow said that he would hire people with the needed experience and skills, and that space stations were not all that different from hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've had four decades of serving people, tens and tens and tens of thousands of people, all over the southwest part of the United States," he said. "I have four decades of building all kinds of things. The principles are the same."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a private company, Bigelow can operate space stations much more efficiently than NASA and its governmental partners can operate the International Space Station, Mr. Bigelow said. (Another of the company values declares: "Make up your mind quickly. Don't take forever, people are waiting, the company is waiting, the future is waiting and time costs money.")</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's interest in inflatables has also been revived once again. Among several large technology demonstration projects proposed in the president's 2011 budget is an inflatable module for the International Space Station. Bigelow is currently talking to NASA about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bigelow envisions variations of the inflatable modules being used for a Moon base or a mission to Mars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our hope is that we can serve NASA," he said. "Because we can do it so much more economically."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GALVESTON, Tex. -- ''Game-changing'' and ''affordable'' are perhaps the most repeated adjectives spoken by NASA officials in the last few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premise underlying President Obama's proposed space policy is that development of new space technologies can speed space exploration at lower costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But skeptics in Congress counter that NASA has provided too few details to convince them that they should largely throw away the $10 billion that has been spent so far in NASA's Constellation moon program and spend billions more on something new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a workshop last month in Galveston, members of NASA study teams looking at how to put in effect the Obama policy presented their current thinking to 450 attendees from industry and academia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NASA presenters, in describing how the space agency could make it to Mars on a limited budget, said their ideas represented ''a point of departure'' that would be revised with feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new plans place a heavy emphasis on in-orbit refueling stations, which would reduce the size of rockets needed. For propulsion to Mars, the road map envisions a nuclear-powered ion engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some aspects remain fuzzy. Cristina Guidi, deputy director for NASA's Constellation systems division, who talked about future heavy-lift rockets, said NASA had not figured out how powerful a heavy lifter it needs for human missions beyond Earth orbit, much less a specific design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA is also looking at a series of robotic missions, to the Moon, to asteroids, to Mars, that would gather data needed to set the stage for future astronauts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developing technology before deciding on a specific mission, however, leaves some worried that programs could fall victim to the type of budget cuts that have historically affected NASA's technology programs. For example, NASA's last effort to develop a nuclear reactor for spacecraft was canceled after only three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the proposed technology programs being considered are already facing cutbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has proposed continuing development of the Orion crew capsule, which was slated for cancellation with the rest of Constellation, as a lifeboat for the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slimmed-down Orion would still cost $4.5 billion to complete, and that money would come at the expense of other items in the human spaceflight program. None of the cuts would come from the $6 billion proposed for the space agency's commercial crew initiative over the next five years, so much of the money is likely to come out of the technology programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans presented at the Galveston conference did not take Orion into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll just have to rebalance the whole portfolio,'' said Michael G. Conley, the study leader for NASA's so-called flagship demonstration projects, which include a prototype fueling station. ''I'm still optimistic we can do some things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A presentation on NASA's commercial crew plans suggested that the agency would give companies wide leeway, but would also require the work to be done at a fixed cost rather than the ''cost-plus'' contracts that govern most of NASA's current work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James S. Voss, vice president of space exploration systems at <span class="companylink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</span>, which is developing a small spaceplane called Dreamchaser that would ride atop an Atlas V rocket, said that what he heard at the workshop ''was exactly what we were hoping for and working for.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has greatly scaled back the work it will do in the coming months on its program to return astronauts to the moon, telling companies working on the program to set aside money to cover its potential cancellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes, which the NASA administrator, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., described in letters to members of Congress on Wednesday, hobble the program, known as Constellation, possibly to a point beyond repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, NASA has spent about $10 billion on an effort to return astronauts to the moon. The Obama administration wants to cancel Constellation, arguing it is too expensive, but Congress has so far not agreed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In passing the current budget, Congress inserted a clause that prohibits NASA from canceling Constellation or starting up a replacement program without its approval. Critics of Mr. Obama's proposed policy say this week's moves are an effort to bypass Congress and kill the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised Constellation plans largely end work on the Ares I rocket that was to replace the space shuttles for taking astronauts to orbit, and scale back efforts on the Orion crew capsule, which was to ride atop the Ares I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the letters, General Bolden said remaining Constellation money would be focused on future development that could be transferred to the program Mr. Obama proposed in his 2011 budget. About one-third to two-thirds of the 7,800 contract employees working on Constellation could lose their jobs, NASA estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is a clause in the contracts of the prime Constellation contractors, which include <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>., or ATK, which says the contractors are responsible for cancellation costs. When asked about their termination costs this spring, however, ATK and <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> said they expected NASA to pay for them, as had been past practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> has estimated its cancellation costs at $350 million; ATK at $500 million. In total, the companies' cancellation costs are expected to reach nearly $1 billion, NASA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They won't get more funds for that,'' said a NASA official who was not authorized to speak on the record. The official said the clause was standard in most federal contracts, and that NASA was not handling Constellation differently than other programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, another contractor, negotiated a clause that says NASA would pay for cancellation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the letters, General Bolden wrote that because of federal budget rules that prohibit agencies from incurring costs beyond what has been appropriated, ''NASA has no choice but to correct this situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Pace, a former associate administrator for program analysis and evaluation at NASA and now director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said, ''In a brief check with people more knowledgeable than me, NASA has never held contractors' liable for termination liability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this is to be the new agency policy and practice, then NASA should shift responsibility for termination liability on all of its current contracts, not simply Constellation,'' Dr. Pace said. ''As it stands, this appears to be purposefully punitive against a specific set of NASA contractors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tussle over Constellation and the future of NASA will continue and will probably become more contentious. ''The administration is disregarding these policies with reckless abandon and doing so in a way that I find to be in complete violation of the legal parameters,'' said Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, where ATK is based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said Congress might write its own space policy. ''The White House didn't do the footwork to develop and sell its plan for human spaceflight,'' he said in a statement. ''Now it's locked in a stalemate with members of Congress who want to continue or restructure the Constellation program. That leaves NASA in limbo, which is exactly what Administrator Bolden's letter reflects.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are about to find out just how generous nature really is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, astronomers operating NASA's Kepler spacecraft will release a list of about 350 stars newly suspected of harboring planets, including five systems with multiple candidate planets. That data could dramatically swell the inventory of alien worlds, which now stands at 461, none of them habitable by the likes of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astronomers everywhere, who have been waiting since Kepler's launch in March 2009 to get their hands on this data, will be rushing to telescopes to examine these stars in the hopes of advancing the grand quest of finding Earthlike planets capable of harboring life out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a lot of attention has been paid in astronomical circles over the past few months to what the Kepler team will not be saying. By agreement with NASA, the team is holding back data on its 400 brightest and best planet candidates, which the astronomers intend to observe themselves over abusy summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA's policy requires astronomers to release their data from instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope in a year, but the Kepler astronomers say launch delays and other problems robbed them of the observing time they needed to check out their planet candidates, which are only visible from the ground from April until September. An extension of the deadline is needed, they say, to guard against a flood of bogus claims -- ''false positives'' -- by other astronomers misinterpreting their data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I sent you 0's and 1's, it would be useless,'' said William Borucki, Kepler's leader, from the Ames Research Laboratory at Moffett Field in California. The public wants answers to the age-old question of whether the Earth is unique, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we say, 'Yes, they are small planets,' '' he went on, ''you can be sure they are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to hold back some data, reported on Nature.com, has divided astronomers. Some say say they do not begrudge the Kepler scientists -- who have in some cases devoted their careers to the project -- a few more months with their data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Kalas of the University of California, Berkeley, who used Hubble to take one of the first images of an exoplanet in 2008, said, ''The stakes aren't that high compared to human subject experiments, where a six-month delay has real consequences when therapies might become available for diseases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sequestering of the data, even temporarily, has irritated other astronomers, who believe that it is antithetical to the ideal of scientific openness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kepler was constructed and launched with a comparatively large sum of money for a project that is run by a single team,'' said Ben Oppenheimer, an astronomer at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, in an e-mail message. ''At this point, I have to say I do think they are being far too restrictive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B. Scott Gaudi, an astronomer and planet hunter at Ohio State University, said there were more planet candidates than the Kepler team members could check by themselves. ''They need help,'' he said. ''If they were more open they would be able to get more science out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then he added: ''Who am I to say this? I didn't put 10 years of my life into this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody denies that the stakes, both personal and institutional, are huge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first astronomer who can prove they found an Earthlike planet around an Earthlike star will win many kudos and prizes,'' said John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led a NASA advisory committee that approved the deal. ''It's glory for NASA,'' he added.''NASA would like to have one of its missions find an Earthlike planet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of data -- who owns it and who gets to see it, and when -- has become one of the more contentious issues in science, scientists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, scientific data consisted of carefully inked notations in research notebooks, bound, with numbered pages, accumulating on a bookshelf in the office or lab, or photographic plates in yellowing envelopes sitting in a filing cabinet. And it was proprietary, meaning it was yours forever to publish or mull endlessly as you desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it often consists of billions or trillions of 1's and 0's reposing in vast digital archives, whose capacity is measured in terabytes or petabytes, buttressed by the giant computer programs that process it and the reams of ancillary information, dubbed metadata, that give it context.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the era of the Web, all this information can be sent around the globe at the click of a mouse, retrieved and manipulated by anyone who wants to use it to better understand the nature of dark matter, argue about the safety or desirability of nuclear power, or decide how much salt to put in her food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Science is more and more living in a glass house,'' said Robbert Dijkgraaf, a physicist at the University of Amsterdam and co-chairman of the InterAcademy Council, a multinational organization of science academies that is reviewing the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at the request of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phillip Sharp, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led a National Academy of Sciences study last year that said rules for sharing data should be built into projects. In an interview, he said: ''The time has past when a bunch of elite true-meaning experts could go into the next room and make conclusions. They have to be transparent. That's a change in the culture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a shift in the balance between the duty of a scientist to wring every last drop of truth and credibility out of the data he or she might have spent years gathering and the rights of the rest of us to know what our tax dollars have discovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Proprietary'' has become a four-letter word, said Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago who was part of the panel on research data. He said he worried that the pendulum had swung too far toward the Internet ideal of free information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Secrets have been part of modern science since its beginning. Galileo reported his discovery of the rings of Saturn in an anagram that he wouldn't decode until he was sure that he wasn't seeing things. In the early 1960s, when radio astronomers discovered the powerful radio sources known now as quasars, they jealously guarded their coordinates, giving them to only a few trusted astronomers to investigate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The members of a scientific collaboration typically agree not to talk about their results before they have been officially released in a paper or a news conference, for example, upon pain of being kicked out. The Kepler team took this a step farther by signing formal nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, few areas of physical science have excited the public imagination in recent years as the search for planets around other stars, dubbed exoplanets. Most of them are giants like Jupiter in orbits broilingly close to their stars, but that is not surprising, since most of them were found by looking at stars that wobble under the influence of their planets; the wobble from big planets up close is much easier to detect than that of an Earth at a more temperate distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kepler employs a different approach, which Mr. Borucki has championed ever since 1984. It stares at a patch of sky in the constellation Cygnus, constantly measuring the brightness of 156,000 different stars looking for the small blips that would signal a planet's passing in front of its star.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a sense, it's the most boring mission ever flown: doing the same thing every six seconds,'' Mr. Borucki said. The grand scientific goal of the project, a kind of cosmic census planned to go on until 2013, is to discover Earthlike planets in Earthlike places -- that is to say, in the not-too-cold, not-too-hot Goldilocks zones near a star where liquid water can exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Borucki said the Kepler team started out with 12,000 suspicious dips. They laboriously whittled down those to 956 planet candidates, then quickly dismissed 204 as false positives. That leaves about 750 real candidates, some with supposed orbits of less than a day. Only about half of them, he suspects, will turn out to be real planets. The rest will be double stars, triple stars, starspots and other impostors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have dozens of ways of recognizing when it isn't a planet,'' said Mr. Borucki.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realizing earlier this year that sorting them out would take more time than they had before the June 15 deadline, the Kepler team asked NASA for an extension. Jon Morse, director of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, referred the Kepler question to the astrophysics subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Council, a group of 13 astronomers who serve as a go-between between the space agency and professional astronomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 12, the Kepler team presented the committee with four options. The most radical, and Mr. Borucki's favorite, was to hold back the data on 500 candidates until the end of the mission or until the planets had been verified. At the other end of the spectrum was an option to release everything on June 15, as originally planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Huchra of Harvard, who led the discussion, said, ''We all felt the sooner the data hit the streets the better,'' and in the end there were no votes for holding back candidate data until the end of the mission. ''If we had done that everybody would have been hung out to dry,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group settled on a compromise in which Kepler will be able to protect 400 planet candidates until Feb. 1 -- an extra eight months -- and an additional 100 from a second set of candidates in another data release in 2011. The extra time will in effect give the Kepler astronomers back the summer observing season they lost last year. The compromise, Dr. Morse said, was ''in the spirit of the regular release policy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the treasure hunt for the end to cosmic loneliness continues.''The public wants to know whether there is life on other planets,'' Mr. Borucki said, noting that it could take decades. The effort to get an answer, he said, reminds him of the building of the great cathedrals in Europe, in which each generation of workers had to tell themselves that ''someday it will be built.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a sense, we, too, are doing these things,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Space Exploration Technologies</span>, known as <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>, has inked a $492 million deal with Iridium Communications to launch a fleet of next-generation commercial satellites aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal, to be announced Wednesday, comes two weeks after Falcon 9 reached orbit on its maiden test flight. Iridium previously announced plans to replace its current satellite network by launching six dozen next-generation satellites between 2015 and 2017 at a cost of $2.9 billion. The company, which covers the whole world, uses the satellites to provide voice and data services for commercial and government clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither company would say how many Falcon 9 launches would be required to put the satellites into low-Earth orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Each rocket launch will carry multiple satellites into space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">SpaceX</span> was founded by Elon Musk, an Internet entrepreneur, in 2002 after he sold his online payment company, <span class="companylink">PayPal</span>, to <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for $1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Musk called the Iridium deal ''a very big endorsement.'' The satellite phone company had its choice of international launch providers, but ultimately chose Hawthorne, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Russian rocket carrying two astronauts from the United States and one from Russia lifted off successfully early Wednesday from Kazakhstan, bound for the international space station. The spacecraft, the Soyuz TMA-19, is carrying the astronauts, Douglas H. Wheelock, Shannon Walker and Fyodor Yurchikhin, to the international orbiting laboratory for a mission lasting about six months. The three will be onboard the space station to see the final shuttle, the Endeavour, depart from its last planned mission to the lab in November before the fleet is retired. With the shuttle being phased out, the Soyuz rocket will be the only means by which astronauts can travel to the station.</p>

</div><div class="author">By KENNETH CHANG </div><div>870 words</div><div>26 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the political battle over the nation's space program, the first casualties are people like Donny Smith, an engineer who received his layoff notice Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been preparing, trying to find something else to move to,'' said Mr. Smith, who works for <span class="companylink">Bastion Technologies</span>, one of the companies NASA has hired to help design rockets to return astronauts to the moon as part of its Constellation program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers at Bastion and elsewhere are caught in a growing conflict between Congress, which has banned NASA from canceling any part of Constellation, and agency leaders who have directed program managers to scale back their work while preserving the parts that would fit into the new space policy proposed by President Obama.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration wants to turn to commercial companies for taking future astronauts to orbit while taking a hiatus from any ambitious missions to send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit. Yet Congress has not agreed to the scuttling of Constellation and added a clause in this year's federal budget that prohibited NASA from canceling the program or starting a new one without Congressional assent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skirmishing continued in earnest this week. Staff members on the House Committee on Science and Technology are reviewing documents that NASA sent over Friday evening to comply with the committee's demand for information used in formulating the president's proposal. In addition, on Tuesday, 62 House members signed a letter sent to President Obama ''to express concern'' over the direction of NASA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is in the nation's best interest to leverage the investments made in Constellation over the last five years, into a beyond low-Earth orbit exploration program, today,'' said the letter writers, which included representatives of both political parties from states far beyond Texas, Alabama and Florida, which are home to the major NASA centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basis for the latest Constellation upheaval is a clause in the contracts of <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, <span class="companylink">Alliant Techsystems Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Pratt &amp;Whitney Rocketdyne</span>, which states that the companies are responsible for setting aside contract money to pay for termination costs if the Constellation program were canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to letters from NASA this year, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> and Alliant, more commonly known as ATK, said that for decades the space agency paid for termination costs like severance pay for workers and that the companies had not reserved money to cover that. <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> has estimated its cancellation costs at $350 million, ATK at $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two contracts with <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, another of the companies working on Constellation, were modified in late January so that NASA, not <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, set aside $81 million to pay for termination costs. Those changes were made less than two weeks before the administration announced its desire to cancel Constellation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter this month to leaders of key Congressional committees, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, cited the Anti-Deficiency Act -- a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending more money than has been allocated by Congress -- in announcing that the agency was scaling back Constellation to cover termination costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span>, the prime contractor for the Orion crew capsule that Mr. Obama has proposed turning into a lifeboat for the International Space Station, threatened to shut down the program if it had to set aside the termination costs. NASA has now sped up payment of $80 million to the company and then added $83 million to the contract to help <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> manage the termination costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want these contractors to go out of business if we can,'' said Andrew Hunter, a NASA budget official. ''They were going to shut down work on the 27th. We're keeping them alive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATK is still holding to the position that NASA is responsible for termination costs, and it has not aside money or prepared layoffs. As planned, ATK is receiving $160 million for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the infusion of money, <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> is still moving 600 jobs off Orion, including 300 among its subcontractors. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has also announced that layoffs are in the works. And with the shifting of money among the prime contractors, NASA is cutting so-called support contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire layoff brunt so far is landing on people like Mr. Smith and not NASA government employees. In Huntsville, Ala., often called the Rocket City, Mayor Tommy Battle said he had heard that 700 people could be affected in his city. Nationwide, NASA has estimated that 2,500 to 5,000 jobs could be lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Bastion Technologies</span>, that means layoff notices went to 86 of the 190 employees working on the company's NASA contract for analyzing potential safety issues with the Constellation program's Ares rockets. Bastion's workers get 60 days' notice under federal law, but that law does not apply to all of the contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gives Mr. Smith time to look for work somewhere, but he is not optimistic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the scope of the layoffs and the fact there are more than a thousand people out there now looking,'' Mr. Smith said, ''I really don't know.''</p>
